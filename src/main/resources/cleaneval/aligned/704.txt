THREE SUCH ON-GOING- PROJECTS ARE KALAS, RIND,-AND COPIR.-----THE KALAS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE E ECTS OF SOCIAL NAVIGATION IN A REAL WORLD- SCENARIO: A RECIPE RECOM- MENDER SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, A PUBLIC BETA RELEASE OF THE- SYSTEM IS UNDER STUDY. THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER IN KALAS IS MARTIN SVENSSON.---------- RIND, RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADAPTATION OF CONTENT IN NEW DOMAINS, INVESTIGATES- HOW A CON GURATION SYSTEM CAN-BE ENHANCED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADAPTIVE USER -INTERFACES, TO-SUPPORT THE USER WHEN CON GURING A COMPLEX PRODUCT. RIND IS A- 6 MONTHS PROJECT FUNDED BY VINNOVA, AND ENDS IN DECEMBER------- PRINCIPAL RESEARCHERS ARE-- ASA RUDSTRXOM, RICKARD CXSTER AND TOMAS OLSSON.---------- COPIR (COLLABORATIVE INFORMATION SEEKING AND RETRIEVAL)ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF- SUPPORTING WORKGROUP INTERACTION AND COLLABORATION IN PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION- SEEKING AND RETRIEVAL. THE PROJECT ENDS IN DECEMBER 2001 AND IS--NANCED BY VINNOVA.- PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IS PREBEN HANSEN.---------- KALAS----- THE KALAS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL NAVIGATION IN A REAL WORLD SCENARIO.- BASED ON WORK DONE IN THE PERSONA PROJECT THE KALAS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE DOMAIN OF CHOOSING- INTERESTING RECIPES BASED ON SOCIAL NAVIGATION. IN-THE SPRING OF 2001 WE WILL CONDUCT A- LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF-A RECIPE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM (KALAS), SPANNING OVER TWO MONTHS WITH- APPROXIMATELY 1000 USERS.----- MOTIVATION----- IN A TYPICAL ONLINE GROCERY STORE, THERE WILL BE 10.000 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS TO CHOOSE FROM.- NAVIGATING SUCH A SPACE IS NOT ONLY TIME-CONSUMING BUT CAN ALSO BE BORING AND TEDIOUS.- SOME USERS WILL HAVE MORE DIFFICULTIES THAN OTHERS TO EFFICIENTLY MAKE-USE OF THE EXISTING- ONLINE STORES. IN A STUDY ON AN EXISTING HYPERTEXT BASED ONLINE STORE, IT WAS SHOW- THAT ELDERLY USERS SPENT IN AVERAGE TWICE AS MUCH TIME FINDING ITEMS ON A- SHOPPING LIST THAN DID YOUNGER USERS. IN BOTH AGE CATEGORIES, USERS- SOMETIMES COMPLETELY GAVE UP WHEN SEARCHING FOR CERTAIN ITEMS.---- IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT ON-LINE-FOOD SHOPPERS DO NOT GAIN ANY TIME-FROM- SHOPPING FOOD ONLINE, INSTEAD THEY APPRECIATE FLEXIBILITY IN TIME AND- SPACE. SHOPPERS FEEL THAT THEY CAN AVOID THE TEDIOUS, BORING, FOOD- STORES, BUT THEY LOOSE THE SENSUOUS PLEASURES OF SEEING, TOUCHING AND- SMELLING THE PRODUCTS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT COMPENSATED BY GETTING STATUS AMONG FRIENDS FROM BEING ABLE TO TELL-STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY SHOP FOOD- ONLINE. IN A STUDY BY RICHMOND ON SHOPPING IN A VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT,- IT WAS FOUND THAT USERS ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SOCIAL ASPECTS- OF A PHYSICAL STORE, THEY WANT TO SOCIALISE WITH OTHER PEOPLE.--------- GIVEN THE PROBLEMS WITH NAVIGATION AND THE LACK OF-SOCIAL INTERACTION- AND SENSUOUS PLEASURES IN THE EXISTING ONLINE GROCERY STORES, THE DOMAIN- SHOULD BE AN EXCELLENT-APPLICATION EXAMPLE-FOR SOCIAL NAVIGATION TECHNIQUES.--------- RESEARCH QUESTIONS----- THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS IN OUR-STUDY. WE KNOW- THAT SOCIAL NAVIGATION WORKS, BUT WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT PEOPLE GAIN- BY USING SOCIAL NAVIGATION ENHANCED SYSTEMS. THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS SEEMS- CRUCIAL AND IT IS THESE THAT WE AIM TO INVESIGATE:------- FILTERING----: A COUPLE-OF USER STUDIES SHOW THAT HISTORY-ENRICHED- ENVIRONMENTS AND RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS MIGHT HELP FILTER OUT THE MOST RELEVANT- INFORMATION-FROM A LARGE INFORMATION SPACE.------------ QUALITY----: SOMETIMES IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT-THE INFORMATION OBTAINED- IS RELEVANT, IT MUST ALSO POSSESS QUALITIES THAT CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED- FROM HOW OTHER USERS REACTS TO IT (THE SOCIAL TEXTURE DISCUSSED IN THE- INTRODUCTION). ONLY WHEN AN EXPERT VERIFIES THAT A PIECE OF INFORMATION- IS VALID, OR WHEN A PIECE OF ART IS OFTEN REFERRED TO IN THE LITERATURE,--WILL IT BE-OF HIGH QUALITY IN THE EYES OF A NAVIGATOR.------------ SOCIAL AFFORDANCE----: VISIBLE ACTIONS OF OTHER USERS CAN INFORM US- WHAT IS APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR, WHAT CAN OR CANNOT BE DONE. AT THE SAME TIME,- THIS AWARENESS OF OTHERS AND THEIR ACTIONS MAKES US FEEL THAT THE SPACE IS- ALIVE AND MIGHT MAKE IT MORE INVITING. HERE THE FOCUS IS NOT ON WHETHER- USERS NAVIGATE MORE EFFICIENTLY, OR FIND EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED MORE- QUICKLY; INSTEAD, THE INTENT IS TO MAKE THEM STAY LONGER IN THE SPACE,- FEEL MORE RELAXED, AND PERHAPS BE INSPIRED TO TRY OUT NEW FUNCTIONALITY,-TO PICK UP NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INFORMATION ITEMS, OR TO TRY OUT NEW SERVICES-THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED OTHERWISE. USERS CAN QUICKLY PICK UP ON THE-"NORMS" FOR HOW TO BEHAVE WHEN-THEY SEE OTHERS BEHAVIOURS.-------------USAGE RESHAPES FUNCTIONALITY AND STRUCTURE----: SOCIAL NAVIGATION DESIGN- MAY ALTER THE ORGANISATION OF THE SPACE. IN AMAZON.COM, THE STRUCTURE OF- THE SPACE EXPERIENCED BY VISITORS IS-CHANGED: ONE CAN FOLLOW THE- RECOMMENDATIONS INSTEAD OF NAVIGATING BY THE SEARCH-FOR-TERMS STRUCTURE.- SOCIAL NAVIGATION THUS COULD BE A-FIRST STEP-TOWARDS EMPOWERING USERS TO,- IN A NATURAL-SUBTLE WAY, MAKE THE FUNCTIONALITY AND-STRUCTURE -DRIFT" AND--MAKE OUR INFORMATION SPACES MORE "FLUID-"OF COURSE, SOCIAL NAVIGATION COMES WITH A PRICE. THE MAJOR DRAWBACKS- WITH SOCIAL NAVIGATION ARE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT USERS HAS TO BE VISIBLE- AND THAT IT (IN MANY SITUATIONS) RELIES ON A LARGE USER POPULATION:------------ PRIVACY----: SINCE SOCIAL NAVIGATION RELIES ON THE VISIBILITY-OF PEOPLE AND THEIR ACTIONS, PEOPLE HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF THEIR- PRIVACY. IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO DO THIS AND TO- WHAT EXTENT? THERE IS ALSO INDICATIONS OF THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIVACY- IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL. SOME-USERS ARE WILLING TO SHARE ALMOST ANYTHING ABOUT- THEMSELVES, WHILST OTHERS WANT TO BE TOTALLY INVISIBLE.------------ BOOTSTRAPPING----: SINCE SOCIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEMS OFTEN RELY ON-THE ACCUMULATED USERS BEHAVIOUR, SUCH AS, TRAILS OF WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GONE AND-RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS, THEY WILL WORK POORLY-WHEN LITTLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN-COLLECTED. IS IT-POSSIBLE TO FIND TECHNIQUES THAT SOMEWHAT OVERCOME THIS-PROBLEM BY, FOR INSTANCE, USING OTHER STRATEGIES TO RECOMMEND IN AN EARLY STAGE-OF THE SYSTEMS LIFECYCLE?------------ SNOWBALL EFFECTS----: AT THE OTHER END OF THE BOOTSTRAPPING PROBLEM-WE FACE ANOTHER-PROBLEM. WHEN MORE AND MORE PEOPLE-WALKS DOWN-THE- "WRONG" PATH THIS WILL BE INDICATED AS A -GOOD" PATH IN A TYPICAL SOCIAL- NAVIGATION SYSTEM. TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT AND-DEAL WITH -THESE WRONG PATHS?------------ CONCEPT DRIFT----: OVER TIME PEOPLE AND INFORMATION CHANGE. WHAT-WAS INTERESTING TO ME YESTERDAY MAY BE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TODAY. RECOMMENDER-SYSTEMS TEND TO GET--CONSERVATIVE" IN-THE SENSE THAT ONCE THEY HAVE A USER-PROFILE IT IS-VERY DIFFICULT TO-CHANGE IT.-IN ORDER FOR SOCIAL NAVIGATION TO-BE-REALLY SUCCESSFUL IT HAS TO-TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT PEOPLES' INTERESTS-CHANGE AND THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION HAVE DIFFERENT EXPIRATION-DATES.---------
