-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF FISHES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DID YOU KNOW THAT FISHES EMBARK UPON COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR THAT LEADS TO---- PAIRING AND SPAWNING? MANY PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THIS. THE COURTSHIP OF FISHES IN---- NOT AS COMPLEX NOR AS VARIED AS THAT OF MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE COURTSHIP OF FISHES IS NOT---- COMPLICATED BY INNUENDOS, HIDDEN-MEANINGS AND CRYPTIC-SIGNALS AS IN HOMO SAPIENS. RATHER,---- COURTSHIP IN FISHES, AS WITH BIRDS, MAMMALS AND OTHER ANIMALS, COMPRISES SETS OF---- RECOGNISABLE SIGNALS, FOLLOWING SET SEQUENCES WHICH FOR FISHES, PROVIDED THE PARTNERS ARE---- PHYSIOLOGICALLY READY, CULMINATE IN SPAWNING. COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF FISHES MIGHT BE A---- SIMPLE SET OF SIGNALS-AND ANSWERS OR IT MIGHT-BE-VERY ELABORATE AND COMPLEX, DEPENDING ON---- THE-TYPE OF FISH. HOWEVER, THE SIGNALS ARE ALWAYS EASY FOR POTENTIAL MATES TO READ.---- INDEED, IT IS EASY FOR BIOLOGISTS TO READ AND INTERPRET THESE SIGNALS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AMONG THE-MOST INTERESTING AND-BEST KNOWN-TO AQUARISTS IS THE ELABORATE---- COURTSHIP OF CICHLID FISHES. TYPICALLY A MALE DEVELOPS A TERRITORY WHICH HE DEFENDS FROM---- ALL INTRUDERS. MANY SPECIES ALSO-BUILD NESTS, WHICH MIGHT BE ELABORATE SAND CASTLES, OR---- EXCAVATIONS WITH TUNNELS OR BURROWS, OR MAY SIMPLY BE A CLEANED PART OF THE ROCKY OR SANDY---- AREA IN WHICH THE TERRITORY IS HELD. ONCE THE TASKS OF DEVELOPING A TERRITORY AND BUILDING---- A NEST ARE COMPLETE THE MALE-IS READY TO INVITE FEMALES TO-HIS NEST TO SPAWN. EAGER MALES---- MAY ATTEMPT TO DO THIS EVEN BEFORE THE NEST IS COMPLETE, BUT THEY ARE NEARLY ALWAYS---- REFUSED AS THE FEMALE DOES NOT GET ALL THE CORRECT MESSAGES IF THE NEST IS NOT THERE. ONE---- OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT PART OF THE COURTSHIP RITUAL INCLUDES THE NEST, AND EACH---- NEST TYPE IS SPECIES-SPECIFIC; IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SPECIES THAT IS IMPORTANT TO---- MATE RECOGNITION AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CORRECT PARTNER.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INITIAL INVITATION IS----- `SIDE-SHAKE'----- DURING WHICH THE MALE---- APPROACHES A FEMALE, EXTENDS HIS FINS AND FLEXES SO THAT THE ANAL-FIN, WHICH USUALLY HAS---- ATTRACTIVE SPOTS AND COLOURS-ON-IT, TOWARDS THE FEMALE. IF THE FEMALE IS INTERESTED THE---- MALE THEN TURNS AWAY-AND FACING THE SPAWNING SITE BEATS ITS TAIL IN A MOVEMENT INVITING---- THE FEMALE TO FOLLOW (-----`FOLLOW-SHAKE'-----). IF-THE FEMALE IS STILL INTERESTED, THEN---- WITH EXAGGERATED, UNDULATING MOVEMENTS THE MALE LEADS THE FEMALE TO THE SPAWNING SITE---- (LEAD-SWIM). ONCE IN THE NEST OR SPAWNING SITE, THE COUPLE-CIRCLE EACH OTHER, PERFORM A---- VARIETY OF SHAKES (NEST-SHAKE, VERTICAL NEST SHAKE ETC) AND GENTLY NUDGE EACH OTHER TILL---- THE FEMALE LAYS EGGS. THE FEMALE THEN PICKS UP THE EGGS IN HER MOUTH, SOMETIMES DOING SO---- BEFORE THE-MALE HAS HAD TIME TO-FERTILISE THEM. THIS WOULD BE A WASTE OF EGGS, SO TO SOLVE---- THE PROBLEM THE MALES OF MANY SPECIES HAVE DUMMY EGGS ON THE ANAL FIN. THIS FIN IS SPREAD---- OUT IN FRONT OF THE FEMALE TO DISPLAY THE EGG DUMMIES AND CURLED SLIGHTLY TO HOLD---- SPERMATOZOA THAT HE WILL RELEASE. THE FEMALE TRIES TO PICK THE EGG DUMMIES FROM THE MALE---- ANAL FIN AND IN DOING SO-COLLECTS SPERMATOZOA, THAT FERTILISE THE EGGS IN HER-MOUTH. THE---- NEED TO COLLECT THE EGGS BEFORE-THEY ARE FERTILISED AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT EGGS ARE---- OFTEN STOLEN ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY APPEAR BY OTHER FISHES WHICH FEED UPON THEM. ANOTHER---- PROBLEM IS THAT MALES THAT DO NOT HAVE TERRITORIES, AND WERE NOT CHOSEN AS MATES BY THE---- FEMALE, TRY TO SNEAK SPAWNINGS BY DARTING DOWN BETWEEN THE SPAWNING COUPLE AND FERTILISING ----EGGS THAT ARE EXPOSED. BY COLLECTING THE EGGS PROMPTLY, THE-EFFORTS OF ROBBERS AND-----SNEAKERS ARE LARGELY CIRCUMVENTED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ONCE IN THE MOUTH THE EGGS DEVELOP INTO YOUNG FISH THAT REMAIN THERE---- UNTIL THEY ARE READY TO FEED FOR THEMSELVES. MOST CICHLIDS WILL THEN LOOK AFTER THEIR---- YOUNG-FOR SOMETIME (A FEW DAYS TO FOUR OR MORE WEEKS), TAKING THEM INTO THEIR MOUTHS WHEN-----THERE IS A THREAT FROM PREDATORS. THE-FRY ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO THE MOUTH AT NIGHT FOR ----SAFEKEEPING. ONCE THE FRY ARE INDEPENDENT THEY LEAVE THE CARE OF THE MOTHER. SOME CICHLIDS---- BEHAVE AS CUCKOOS; THEY GIVE THEIR FRY TO ANOTHER SPECIES TO CARE FOR. IT SEEMS THAT THE---- FOSTER PARENT CAN RECOGNISE THE FOREIGN YOUNG, BUT SHE IS UNABLE TO CHASE THEM AWAY OR---- SWALLOW THEM AS BOTH ACTIVITIES WILL ENDANGER HER OWN BROOD. CHASING FOREIGN FRY THAT ARE---- MIXED TIGHTLY IN A SCHOOL WITH ONES OWN FRY IS NOT POSSIBLE-WITHOUT CHASING AWAY THE OWN---- FRY TOO. SIMILARLY, HOW DOES THE MOTHER SWALLOW FOREIGN FRY AND NOT HER OWN?-------------------------------------------------- SUBMITTED BY: DR TONY RIBBINK--------------------------- EMAIL:-------------------------------------------------- A.RIBBINK@RU.AC.ZA--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
