DURING------------- THE YEAR THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED TWO NEW ORGANIZATIONS FOR AFFILIATIONS.------------- THE FIRST WAS THE SOCIETY OF AUTOMOTIVE HISTORIANS (SAH), A SOCIETY------------- THAT ENCOURAGES RESEARCH, DOCUMENTATION, PRESERVATION, AND PUBLICATION------------- OF HISTORY CONCERNING THE INVENTION, DEVELOPMENT, AND INFLUENCE OF------------- THE AUTOMOBILE. FOUNDED IN 1969, THE SAH FOSTER CONNECTIONS AND COOPERATION------------- THROUGH MEETINGS, A MEMBERSHIP DIRECTORY, BIMONTHLY NEWSLETTERS, AND------------- A SEMI-ANNUAL SCHOLARLY JOURNAL, AUTOMOTIVE HISTORY REVIEW.------------------------------------ THE SECOND-WAS THE CENTER FOR HISTORY AND NEW MEDIA-(CHNM), LOCATED------------- AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY IN FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA. SINCE 1994, THE CENTER------------- COMBINES INNOVATIVE DIGITAL MEDIA WITH THE LATEST AND BEST HISTORICAL------------- SCHOLARSHIP TO PROMOTE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PAST AS WELL AS BROAD--------------HISTORICAL LITERACY. AS AN ONLINE SOURCE FOR A VARIETY OF TEACHING------------- AND PROFESSIONAL AIDS, CHNM IS A USEFUL RESOURCE FOR HISTORY TEACHERS------------- OF ANY LEVEL, WITH LINKS TO 1,200 INTERNATIONAL HISTORY DEPARTMENTS;------------- AN INDEXED GUIDE TO 5,--0 HISTORY WEB SITES; AN ANNOTATED GUIDE TO---------------00 U.S. HISTORY SITES; A COMPREHENSIVE DIRECTORY OF 2,-00 WEB SITE------------- IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND FREE SOFTWARE TOOLS------------- USEFUL FOR HISTORIANS AND TEACHERS. AT ITS JANUARY--003 MEETING DURING------------- THE ANNUAL MEETING-IN CHICAGO, COUNCIL ACCEPTED BOTH ORGANIZATIONS------------- AS THE----TH AND 114TH AFFILIATED SOCIETIES. (THEY WILL, THEREFORE,------------- BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF AFFILIATED SOCIETIES THAT WILL APPEAR IN------------- THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2003.)------------------------------------ A MEETING FOR AFFILIATED SOCIETIES WAS CONVENED BY THE COMMITTEE AT------------- THE ANNUAL MEETING TO DISCUSS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE AHA AND THE SOCIETIES.------------- THE ATTENDING SOCIETIES ASSERTED THAT AFFILIATION WITH THE AHA WAS------------- BENEFICIAL TO EVERYONE INVOLVED.--------------------------------------- JAMES M. MCPHERSON------------------------------------------  COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE STUDENTS------------------------------------------------- THE TRANSFORMATION (IN JANUARY 2002) OF THE TASK FORCE ON GRADUATE------------- EDUCATION INTO A STANDING COMMITTEE-------THE AHA COMMITTEE FOR GRADUATE------------- STUDENTS [CGS--------REPRESENTED A STRIKING RECOGNITION OF THE FACT------------- THAT GRADUATE STUDENTS CAN BE MORE THAN MERE APPRENTICES IN THE GOVERNANCE------------- OF THE AHA.------------------------------------ PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK THAT THE CGS ACCOMPLISHED IN RECENT------------- MONTHS WAS TO ESTABLISH-DIRECT LINES OF COMMUNICATION-------THROUGH------------- E-MAIL MESSAGES AND SURVEYS-------WITH GRADUATE STUDENT-MEMBERS OF--------------THE AHA.----------------------------------- IN ADDITION, THE CGS CONTINUED THE TASK FORCE PRACTICE OF ORGANIZING------------- SESSIONS AT AHA ANNUAL MEETINGS BASED ON SUGGESTIONS DIRECTLY RECEIVED------------- FROM GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE GRADUATE STUDENT FORUM AT THE------------- PRECEDING ANNUAL MEETING. CGS ALSO SPONSORED AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER------------- OF FIVE SESSIONS AT THE 2003 ANNUAL MEETING. THESE INCLUDED------ "CAREERS------------- IN HISTORY------" ON THE DISCUSSION OF NONACADEMIC CAREERS AND A------ "NUTS------------- AND BOLTS------" WORKSHOP ON PREPARING FOR AND PARTICIPATING IN THE------------- JOB MARKET.------------------------------------ PARTICULARLY THROUGH OUR LIAISON, FIONA GALVIN, THE CGS HAS ENERGETICALLY------------- COLLABORATED WITH THE AHA'------S COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE EDUCATION------------- (CGE), THE BODY CHARGED WITH CARRYING OUT THE FIRST NATIONAL SURVEY------------- OF GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN HISTORY SINCE------ WE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGED------------- PARTICIPATION OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE CGE'------S SITE VISITS------------- TO PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ARGUING THAT GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE------------- UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO INTERVIEW AND COLLECT ANECDOTAL-DATA FROM OTHER------------- GRADUATE STUDENTS.------------------------------------ AS KEY MEMBERS OF THE AHA, GRADUATE STUDENTS NEED TO-AND WILL CONTINUE------------- TO PLAY-A CENTRAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE DEBATES AND DIRECTION OF THE------------- PROFESSION TODAY IN WAYS THAT WILL ENSURE ITS ADVANCE ALONG INCREASINGLY------------- EQUITABLE LINES.-------------------------------------- LILLIAN GUERRA-------------------------------------------------------  COMMITTEE ON------------- INTERNATIONAL HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES------------------------------------ DURING 2002 THE AHA'------S COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL HISTORICAL------------- ACTIVITIES ACTIVELY WORKED WITH THE BUREAU OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS------------- OF HISTORICAL SCIENCES (ICHS, ALSO OFTEN REFERRED TO, BY THE ABBREVIATION------------- FROM THE FRENCH, AS CISH) TOWARD ORGANIZING THE 20TH INTERNATIONAL------------- CONGRESS TO BE HELD JULY------ 3-9, 2005, IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA. DANE------------- KENNEDY AND ARNITA JONES PARTICIPATED ON BEHALF OF THE AHA IN THE------------- GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ICHS HELD SEPTEMBER------ 2-3, 2002, AT AMSTERDAM------------- AND ALSO ATTENDED A SYMPOSIUM THERE ON THE THEME,------ "PRESENTING------------- THE NATION: CAN IT BE DONE?------------------------------------------" THE AHA COMMITTEE, HAVING INVITED PROPOSALS FROM MEMBERS INTERESTED------------- IN PARTICIPATING AS ORGANIZERS, PRESENTERS, OR DISCUSSANTS IN THE------------- CONGRESS, FORWARDED TO THE BUREAU OF ICHS OVER 60 PANEL PROPOSALS------------- AND 17 NOMINATIONS FOR SESSION ORGANIZERS AND DISCUSSANTS.-------------------------------------- DANE KENNEDY-------------------------------------------  COMMITTEE ON MINORITY HISTORIANS------------------------------------------------- FOR THE COMMITTEE ON MINORITY HISTORIANS, 2002 WAS AN ESPECIALLY PRODUCTIVE------------- YEAR . WE COMPLETED THE DIVERSITY SERIES OF PAMPHLETS-AND BEGAN ARRANGEMENTS------------- TO HAVE SOME OF THE TITLES PUBLISHED ONLINE. WE PARTICIPATED IN TWO------------- MAJOR SESSIONS-------AT THE ANNUAL MEETINGS OF-THE ASSOCIATION FOR------------- THE STUDY OF AFRO-AMERICAN LIFE AND HISTORY AND THE ORGANIZATION OF------------- AMERICAN HISTORIANS. THE COMMITTEE NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY------------- TO THE SURVEY OF THE COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE EDUCATION, BUT ALSO CONDUCTED------------- ITS-OWN SURVEY-OF THE MINORITY MEMBERS OF THE AHA. THE AIM OF THE------------- LATTER WAS TO DETERMINE HOW THE AHA CAN BEST SERVE THIS PARTICULAR------------- CONSTITUENCY AND TO PROVIDE DATA TO HISTORY DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER------------- BODIES TO ASSIST THEM-IN THEIR EFFORTS-TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MINORITY------------- FACULTY, EMPLOYEES, AND STUDENTS.------------------------------------ AT THE 2003 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AHA, THE COMMITTEE ORGANIZED-------CONTINUING------------- A TRADITION OF ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE AT THE ANNUAL MEETINGS-------A------------- SESSION ON THE THEME,------ "INCREASING THE PRESENCE OF MINORITY GRADUATE------------- STUDENTS IN THE PROFESSION.------" ALSO CONTINUING A PRACTICE STARTED------------- AT THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING, THE COMMITTEE ORGANIZED A MENTORING BREAKFAST------------- AT THE------MEETING. AT THIS RESOUNDINGLY SUCCESSFUL GATHERING, GRADUATE------------- STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS PROFESSIONAL CONCERNS WITH SENIOR FACULTY------------- MEMBERS IN AN INFORMAL AND RELAXED SETTING.----------------------------------- THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH A STATEMENT ABOUT RECRUITMENT AND------------- RETENTION OF MINORITY FACULTY, WHICH HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE MODERN------------- LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION'------S COMMITTEE ON THE LITERATURE OF PEOPLE------------- OF COLOR IN THE UNITED-STATES AND-CANADA. TO FACILITATE BROADER DISCUSSION------------- OF THE DOCUMENT (WITH A VIEW TO ISSUING A SIMILAR STATEMENT),--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE COMMITTEE WAS FACILITATED BY THE TIRELESS EFFORTS------------- OF NUMEROUS PEOPLE, BUT AS THE OUTGOING CHAIR, I WOULD LIKE TO ESPECIALLY------------- EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS TO NORALEE------------- FRANKEL, ARNITA JONES, CLIFF JACOBS, PELEG TAL, AND OTHER AHA STAFF------------- MEMBERS.-------------------------------------- STEPHANIE SHAW-----------------------------------------------------------  THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON------------- PART-TIME AND ADJUNCT EMPLOYMENT------------------------------------ CONCERN ABOUT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF-HISTORIANS-TEACHING AS PART-TIME------------- OR ADJUNCT FACULTY LED TO THE CREATION OF A PERMANENT JOINT OAH-AHA------------- COMMITTEE ON PART-TIME AND ADJUNCT EMPLOYMENT IN JANUARY 2002, WHOSE------------- MEMBERSHIP HAS CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THOSE WHO ARE, OR WHO HAVE IN------------- THE PAST, TAUGHT PART-TIME. THE RISE IN PART-TIME AND ADJUNCT EMPLOYMENT------------- IS A SERIOUS, GROWING ISSUE IN THE PROFESSION. THE LITANY OF PROBLEMS------------- INCLUDE ABYSMALLY LOW PAY, OFTEN TOTAL LACK OF BENEFITS (MEDICAL COVERAGE------------- IS FREQUENTLY THE MOST PRESSING NEED, BUT THE LACK OF PENSION FUNDS------------- HAS SERIOUS LONG RANGE IMPLICATIONS), INELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS OR------------- TRAVEL MONEY (TO HELP WITH RESEARCH THAT JUST MIGHT MAKE ESCAPE POSSIBLE),------------- POOR OR NO OFFICE SPACE OR ASSISTANCE, LACK OF COMPUTERS (AS TECHNOLOGY------------- BECOMES EVER MORE IMPORTANT), AND SOMETIMES NO-LIBRARY ACCESS.------------------------------------ THE PROBLEM IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREFER------------- TO-TEACH PART-TIME SO THAT PROPOSED SOLUTIONS NEED TO LEAVE THIS POSSIBILITY------------- OPEN. THIS INCLUDES RETIRED FACULTY STILL ENGAGED WITH THE DISCIPLINE,------------- THOSE WITH OTHER FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT OR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES,------------- AS WELL AS GRADUATE STUDENTS WORKING TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES. THERE------------- ARE ALSO SMALL DEPARTMENTS THAT CAN ONLY OFFER A SPECIALIZED COURSE------------- WITH A PART-TIME/ADJUNCT EMPLOYEE. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE ISSUE IS------------- THE NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS DEALING WITH FINANCIAL CUTS BY HIRING A------------- LARGE NUMBER OF TEACHERS AT VERY LOW WAGES, WHO THEN TRY TO SURVIVE------------- BY PIECING TOGETHER JOBS AT SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS. SOLUTIONS NEED TO------------- GO IN TWO DIRECTIONS. ONE IS TO HALT AND REVERSE THE BLEEDING OF FULL-TIME------------- POSITIONS. THE SECOND IS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER AND FAIRER FOR THOSE------------- WHO DO TEACH PART-TIME. THE COMMITTEE'------S RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE------------- OAH AND AHA INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR A LIMIT ON THE PERCENTAGE OF PART-TIME------------- FACULTY IN A DEPARTMENT, FOR INCREASED SALARIES (AS A PERCENTAGE OF------------- WHAT IS PAID TO FULL-TIME FACULTY), BENEFITS, OFFICE SPACE, ETC. HAVING------------- THE RECOMMENDATIONS ACCEPTED IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. THE HARDER TASK------------- AHEAD WILL BE TO CONVINCE THOSE IN CONTROL OF THE PURSE STRINGS THAT------------- THIS IS NECESSARY.--------------------------------------- MAXINE LURIE------------------------------------------------------  THE COMMITTEE ON WOMEN HISTORIANS------------------------------------ THE COMMITTEE ON WOMEN HISTORIANS------ "MET------" ON THE WEB BETWEEN------------- OCTOBER 23 AND NOVEMBER 4, 2002, WITH ALL MEMBERS PARTICIPATING. OUR------------- DISCUSSIONS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON TWO ISSUES: (1) THE COMMITTEE'------S------------- SURVEY OF WOMEN MEMBERS AND (2) THE STATUS OF THE PAMPHLET SERIES,------------------- "WOMEN'------S AND GENDER HISTORY IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE.-------------------------------------------------------" THE SURVEY WAS SENT TO ALL POST-PHD FEMALE AHA MEMBERS LAST SPRING,------------- BY E-MAIL; 361 REPLIES WERE RECEIVED. MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO COMMENT------------- ON WHETHER OR NOT GENDER HAD, IN THEIR OPINION OR EXPERIENCE, BEEN------------- A FACTOR IN THEIR CAREERS AS HISTORIANS. THEY WERE ALSO ASKED TO COMMENT,------------- IN AN OPEN-ENDED FORMAT, ON WHAT FACTORS-IN PARTICULAR AIDED OR HINDERED -------------THEIR ADVANCEMENT IN THE PROFESSION; WHETHER MENTORING HAD PLAYED------------- ANY ROLE IN THEIR CAREERS; AND ON ANYTHING ELSE THEY WANTED THE COMMITTEE------------- TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AS HISTORIANS. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA (YEAR------------- OF TERMINAL DEGREE, TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT, RANK, RACE/ETHNIC ORIGIN)------------- WERE ALSO COLLECTED. VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN ASSESSING------------- THE DATA SINCE IT WAS RECEIVED, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CLIFF JACOBS------------- OF THE AHA STAFF. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS CLUSTER AROUND ISSUES------------- OF COLLEGIALITY AND ITS ASSESSMENT-------WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO DOCUMENT------------- AND TO CORRELATE WITH WOMEN'------S PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT. OTHER------------- FINDINGS CENTER ON WOMEN'------S PERCEPTIONS OF ONGOING GENDER DISCRIMINATION------------- AT ALL RANKS OF THE PROFESSORIATE.------------------------------------ THE COMMITTEE ASSESSED-THE-CURRENT STATUS OF THE PAMPHLET SERIES.------------- THE AHA HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THE-UNIVERSITY-OF ILLINOIS PRESS--------------FOR THE PUBLICATION OF-THE PAMPHLETS IN VOLUME FORM. NEARLY ALL OF------------- THE CONTRACTED PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE SERIES EDITOR BONNIE------------- SMITH AND REVIEWED BY THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE WAS PLEASED TO------------- SEE THE PAMPHLETS MOVING TOWARD PUBLICATION WITH-A MAJOR PRESS, AND------------- GRATEFUL TO THE AHA STAFF-AND TO BONNIE SMITH FOR MOVING THE PROCESS------------- ALONG.----------------------------------- THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2004 ANNUAL MEETING.------------- THE COMMITTEE ALSO DISCUSSED ITS MISSION STATEMENT AND THE ONGOING------------- WORK OF THE TASK FORCE ON GRADUATE EDUCATION. VIRGINIA-SANCHEZ-KORROL------------- WAS COMMENDED-FOR HER SERVICE-TO THE COMMITTEE.------------------------------------ I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK NORALEE-FRANKEL OF--------------THE AHA STAFF FOR HER SPIRITED,-CREATIVE, AND HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL------------- WORK IN SUPPORT OF THE WORK OF THE CWH FOR THE-PAST THREE YEARS (MY------------- TENURE AS CHAIR).-------------------------------------- ELIZABETH LUNBECK-------------------------------------------------------  THE TASK FORCE ON PUBLIC HISTORY------------------------------------ UPON RECOMMENDATION BY THE PROFESSIONAL DIVISION, COUNCIL CHARGED------------- THE TASK FORCE ON PUBLIC HISTORY TO IDENTIFY WAYS THE ASSOCIATION------------- CAN ADDRESS THE INTERESTS AND CONCERNS OF PUBLIC HISTORIANS AS WELL------------- AS WAYS OF DEEPENING-AN UNDERSTANDING OF AND APPRECIATION FOR THE------------- ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC HISTORIANS WITHIN THE PROFESSION. OUR FINAL REPORT,------------- TO BE SUBMITTED TO COUNCIL AT THE END OF 2003, WILL INCLUDE BOTH A------------- SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS PURSUANT TO OUR------------- CHARGE.------------------------------------ TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS HAVE GOVERNED OUR WORK TO DATE. FIRST,------------- PUBLIC HISTORY IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL HISTORIANS. PUBLIC HISTORY------------- IS NOT A SUBSET OF HISTORY, NOR ARE PUBLIC HISTORIANS A SUBSET OF------------- HISTORIANS. SECOND, PUBLIC HISTORY AND PUBLIC HISTORIANS ARE UNDERSERVED------------- AND UNDERREGARDED BY BOTH THE AHA AND THE-PROFESSION, A SITUATION------------- THAT NEEDS REDRESS. WE ALSO NOTE A WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN AND GREATER------------- ENGAGEMENT WITH PUBLIC HISTORY BY THE PROFESSION.----------------------------------- THE TASK FORCE HAS PURSUED ITS CHARGE BY REVIEWING THE STATEMENT ON------------- STANDARDS, IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL MEETING, CONSULTING------------- WITH THE COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE EDUCATION, CONSIDERING PUBLIC HISTORY------------- EMPLOYMENT, AND DISCUSSING COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER HISTORY-RELATED------------- ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR ADVOCACY FOR PUBLIC------------- HISTORY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND TO IDENTIFY INTERESTS, NEEDS, AND------------- CONCERNS RELATED TO PUBLIC HISTORY AND PUBLIC HISTORIANS, WE CONDUCTED------------- TWO SURVEYS: ONE OF ALL AHA MEMBERS AND ONE OF PUBLIC HISTORIANS.------------- WE ALSO CONDUCTED OPEN FORUMS AT AHA'------S 2002 AND 2003 ANNUAL------------- MEETINGS.----------------------------------- I CONCLUDE BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE CREATIVE THINKING AND HARD WORK OF------------- TASK FORCE MEMBERS, AND THE INVALUABLE ADVICE AND SUPPORT PROVIDED------------- BY AHA STAFF,-ESPECIALLY-ARNITA-JONES AND DEBBIE ANN DOYLE.-------------------------------------- LINDA SHOPES-------------------------------------------------------  THE-TASK FORCE-ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY------------------------------------ THE TFIP------ "MET------" VIA E-MAIL AS NECESSARY, AND AT THE CHICAGO--------------ANNUAL MEETING. OUR INITIAL CHARGE WAS TO ADVISE THE COUNCIL ON INTELLECTUAL--------------PROPERTY (IP) MATTERS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE COUNCIL-ACTION. ONLY ONE------------- SUCH MATTER AROSE THIS-YEAR, AS I-WILL REPORT BELOW, BUT WE HAVE BEEN------------- CONSIDERING WHETHER WE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT A PROJECT THAT MIGHT BE------------- OF CONSIDERABLE USE AND INTEREST TO THE MEMBERSHIP-------A SHORT GUIDE------------- TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES PERTAINING TO HISTORIANS. WHILE THERE IS BY NO------------- MEANS UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT THE--998 DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT------------- ACT (DMCA) MEANS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LAY OUT SOME GENERAL PARAMETERS.------------- WE ALSO PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF PREPARING ARTICLES ON------------- RECENT-DEVELOPMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUES FOR PUBLICATION------------- IN PERSPECTIVES.----------------------------------- THE TASK FORCE HAD A VERY GOOD DISCUSSION (THROUGH E-MAIL) OF THE------------- EFFORTS BEGUN BY LARRY LESSIG (STANFORD UNIV. SCHOOL OF LAW) TO CHALLENGE------------- THE RECENT SONNY BONO TERM EXTENSION ACT, WHICH ADDED 20 YEARS TO------------- THE LIFE OF COPYRIGHTS. THE OSTENSIBLE RATIONALE FOR THE EXTENSION------------- WAS THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDED TO CONFORM TO THE NEW INTERNATIONAL------------- STANDARD OF 70 YEARS FOR COPYRIGHTS (AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S. STANDARD------------- WAS 50 YEARS). THE TFIP WAS UNANIMOUS IN ITS VIEW THAT THE BONO ACT------------- CREATED BAD POLICY FOR THE WORK OF HISTORIANS, AND RECOMMENDED TO------------- THE COUNCIL THAT THE AHA JOIN THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES-------------------' AMICUS BRIEF SUPPORTING THE LESSIG CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE------------- BONO ACT IN WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS THE ELDRED V. ASHCROFT CASE.------------- WE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLICITED BY A GROUP PREPARING AN AMICUS BRIEF------------- SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY FOR HISTORIANS, BUT BECAUSE WE FELT THAT WE------------- SHOULD NOT SIGN TWO BRIEFS, WE DID NOT RECOMMEND GOING FORWARD WITH------------- THE SECOND. LESSIG ARGUED OUR POSITION TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME------------- COURT THIS SPRING, AND THE COURT WILL PROBABLY HAND DOWN ITS OPINION------------- IN THE LATE SPRING OF------ THIS MAY BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DECISION,------------- BECAUSE THE ACT IS BEING CHALLENGED ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL------------- BASIS FOR COPYRIGHT REGULATION IS THE PROMOTION OF CREATIVITY. A DECISION------------- IN FAVOR OF THE CHALLENGE WOULD OPEN THE WAY TO FURTHER LITIGATION------------- AGAINST ASPECTS OF THE DMCA, AND MIGHT BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE------------- SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY.-------------------------------------- STANLEY N. KATZ--------------------------------------------------------THE PACIFIC COAST BRANCH OF THE AHA------------------------------------ THE AHA COUNCIL, MEETING IN SAN FRANCISCO IN JANUARY 2002 ENDORSED------------- THE REVISION OF ARTICLE II OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PACIFIC COAST------------- BRANCH (PCB) TO CLARIFY THE PURPOSES OF THE ORGANIZATION, SPECIFICALLY:------------------- "THE PURPOSES OF THE ORGANIZATION SHALL BE THE ADVANCEMENT OF------------- THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION, AND THE PROMOTION------------- OF THE HISTORICAL INTERESTS OF THE MEMBERSHIP WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS------------- ON THE UNITED STATES, WESTERN CANADA, MEXICO, THE PACIFIC RIM, AND------------- THEIR INTER-RELATIONSHIPS.-----------------------------------------" AT THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE PCB, HELD IN AUGUST AT TUCSON, NEARLY------------- 150 INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN 37 ACADEMIC SESSIONS.

DAVID BAIRD-------------------------------------------------------------------  THE 2002 PROGRAM COMMITTEE------------------------------------ THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION WAS,------------- THANKS TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE AHA STAFF, A SMOOTHLY RUN AND-VERY------------- SUCCESSFUL EVENT. A-WIDE RANGE-OF PAPERS AND AN ATTENDANCE BEYOND------------- WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IN LIGHT OF THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,------------- 2001, ATTEST TO THE-CONTINUED RELEVANCE OF THE AHA TO THE PROFESSION.------------------------------------------------- THE--002 PROGRAM-COMMITTEE RECEIVED 358 PROPOSALS FOR PRESENTATIONS--------------AT THE CONFERENCE, OF WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO ACCEPT ONLY----- PROPOSALS------------- CAME NOT ONLY FROM OUR LOCAL COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES,------------- BUT FROM EUROPE, AUSTRALASIA, AND ELSEWHERE. OUR THEME-------------"FRONTIERS-----------"--PRODUCED------------- A WONDERFUL DIVERSITY OF PANELS, AND CLEARLY SPOKE TO THE GROWING------------- INTEREST IN REGIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDIES. WE RECEIVED AN UNUSUALLY--------------HIGH NUMBER OF COMPARATIVE PROPOSALS, AND WERE ABLE THEREFORE TO OFFER------------- MANY PANELS DESIGNED TO DRAW PEOPLE FROM A BROADER THAN USUAL RANGE------------- OF REGIONAL SPECIALISMS.------------------------------------ THE TOPICAL BREAKDOWN OF PROPOSALS RECEIVED IS AS FOLLOWS:----------------------------------- *PANELS THAT ARE SPONSORED BY VARIOUS AHA BODIES AND THUS GUARANTEED------------- A PLACE ON THE PROGRAM. THESE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIGURES FOR THE------------------- "ACCEPTED------" COLUMN.----------------------------------- OUR EXPERIENCE WAS AN EXHILARATING AND EXCITING ONE. THE JOB OF PROGRAM------------- CHAIR IS AN ARDUOUS ONE, THOUGH MADE CONSIDERABLY EASIER BY THE EXPERIENCE------------- AND EFFICIENCY OF THE AHA STAFF.------------------------------------ WE OWE A TREMENDOUS DEBT TO OUR PROGRAM COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES. WE OWE------------- OUR THANKS ALSO TO GABRIELLE SPIEGEL,-VICE PRESIDENT OF THE RESEARCH------------- DIVISION, AND WM. ROGER LOUIS, 2001 PRESIDENT, WHO WERE GENEROUSLY------------- SUPPORTIVE OF OUR IDEAS AND EFFORTS. WE ARE ETERNALLY IN THE DEBT------------- OF JOE WRIGHT, OUR EXTRAORDINARILY GIFTED GRADUATE ASSISTANT, AND------------- WE ARE GRATEFUL ALSO-TO THE-AHA STAFF,-MOST NOTABLY SHARON K. TUNE,------------- DEBBIE DOYLE, VERNON HORN, ROBERT TOWNSEND, AND PILLARISETTI SUDHIR.---------------------------------------------------- PHILIPPA LEVINE---------------------------- THE 2003 PROGRAM COMMITTEE------------------------------------ THE 117TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION HELD------------- IN CHICAGO, JANUARY------ 2-5, 2003, WAS A HUGE SUCCESS. THE PROGRAM------------- FEATURED 168 PANELS THAT COVERED VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR HISTORICAL------------- THEME AND TOPIC, TIME PERIOD, AND REGION OF THE WORLD. ATTENDANCE------------- THROUGHOUT WAS EXCELLENT, AND MOST OF THE SESSIONS, INCLUDING THOSE------------- HELD ON SUNDAY, DREW SIZABLE AUDIENCES.------------------------------------ THE 2003 PROGRAM COMMITTEE RECEIVED ONLY 203 PROPOSALS, A CONSIDERABLE------------- DROP FROM THE 2002 TALLY OF MORE THAN 350 SUBMISSIONS. THIS NOTICEABLE------------- DECLINE IN SUBMISSIONS MAY HAVE STEMMED FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS------------- SUCH AS CYCLICAL FLUCTUATIONS, THE ABSENCE OF A SPECIFIC THEME FOR------------- THE MEETING, AND CHICAGO IN JANUARY BEING LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN, SAY,------------- AN EAST OR WEST COAST LOCALE.------------------------------------ NEVERTHELESS, THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE------------- PROPOSALS IT HAD TO CHOOSE FROM AND DEBATED THEIR PROS AND CONS AT------------- A MEETING HELD APRIL------ 19-21, 2002, IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THE FOLLOWING------------- IS A BREAKDOWN OF PROPOSALS RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED:----------------------------------- BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF SERVING ON THIS YEAR'------S COMMITTEE,------------- I HAVE SEVERAL-OBSERVATIONS TO MAKE THAT MAY BE WORTH CONSIDERING------------- IN THE FUTURE. AS THE SUBJECT DISTRIBUTION ABOVE REVEALS, WE NEED------------- TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY AND ENHANCE THE PROGRAM. WE PROBABLY SHOULD------------- BE MORE PROACTIVE IN SOLICITING PANEL PROPOSALS ON AFRICA AND THE -------------ANCIENT PERIOD BECAUSE THEY ARE TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED YEAR------------- AFTER YEAR. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO PANELS THAT DEALT EXCLUSIVELY WITH------------- AFRICA, FIVE PANELS INCLUDED COVERAGE OF IT. I SUSPECT SUBMISSIONS------------- RELATING TO ASIA, COMPARATIVE, MIDDLE EAST, WORLD, AND------ "OTHER-------------------" WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND TAKE THEIR PLACE ALONGSIDE THE CONSISTENTLY------------- SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF AMERICAN, EUROPEAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN PANELS.------------- THE MIX OF REGIONS WILL ALSO CHANGE FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR AS THEME-CENTERED------------- PROGRAMS CALL FOR AND ENCOURAGE CROSS-REGIONAL COMPARISONS.------------------------------------ ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PANELS-------ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE CATEGORIES OF------------------- "PEDAGOGY------" AND------ "OTHER-----------"--WERE INCLUDED------------- IN THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY WERE SPONSORED SUBMISSIONS, IT MAY BE------------- WORTH NOTING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND A-PLACE EVEN-ON THEIR OWN------------- MERITS.------------------------------------A WONDERFUL INNOVATION FOR THE 2003 MEETING WAS THE ADDITION OF SIX------------- PRESIDENTIAL SESSIONS THAT ENRICHED THE PROGRAM BY ADDING CONTENT------------- THAT MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN WELL REPRESENTED. LYNN HUNT, THE------------- 2002 PRESIDENT, CONSULTED THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE ABOUT HER CHOICE OF------------- TOPICS AND PANELISTS AND JUDICIOUSLY-SCHEDULED THE PRESIDENTIAL SESSIONS------------- TO OCCUPY KEY TIME SLOTS ON THURSDAY, FRIDAY, AND SATURDAY. THESE------------- PANELS WERE A MAJOR HIGHLIGHT OF THE CHICAGO MEETING. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS------------- WERE FIRST-RATE-AND ATTENDANCE AT SOME OF THEM RAN INTO THE HUNDREDS.------------------------------------------------- NO PROGRAM COMMITTEE MAKES-MUCH HEADWAY WITHOUT THE HEROIC EFFORTS------------- OF THE AHA STAFF-------ESPECIALLY SHARON K. TUNE AND DEBBIE DOYLE-------IN------------- FACILITATING THE CRUCIAL WASHINGTON, D.C. MEETING. THANKS ARE DUE--------------AS WELL TO-LYNN HUNT, THE AHA COUNCIL, THE MEMBERS OF THE-COMMITTEE------------- AND, ESPECIALLY, TO LORA KNIGHT (UNIV. OF UTAH), THE COMMITTEE'------S------------- GRADUATE STUDENT ASSISTANT.------------------------------------------------------------ ANAND A.
