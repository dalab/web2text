THESE PRACTICE VARIABLES INCLUDE---- (A) THE-EFFECTS OF-A MODEL'S SKILL LEVEL DURING OBSERVATION,---- (B) HOW AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED TWO A LEARNER AND (C)---- HOW PRACTICE CONDITIONS ARE ARRANGED WHEN LEARNING MULTIPLE TASKS.---- THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH IN THESE AREAS SUGGEST THAT COGNITIVE---- PROCESSES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF SKILL---- ACQUISITION. MOREOVER, THE EFFORT BY WHICH THESE COGNITIVE PROCESSES---- ARE UNDERTAKEN IS INFLUENCED BY PRACTICE VARIABLES. MOTOR LEARNING---- IS ENHANCED WHEN THESE VARIABLES ARE MANIPULATED TO PROMOTE COGNITIVE---- EFFORT BY A LEARNER.-------------------------------------------------------- DESPITE THEIR BEST INTENTIONS,---- PEOPLE SOMETIMES TEND TO BE LAZY THINKERS DURING PRACTICE. FOR---- INSTANCE, HITTING A BUCKET OF GOLF BALLS AT THE DRIVING RANGE---- CAN BE MONOTONOUS. AT TIMES, THE SWING SEEMS TO GO INTO----- "AUTOPILOT---------" - THE MIND TAKES A SHORT TEST, AND INDIVIDUALS TEND TO REPEAT---- PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED GOALS WITHOUT GIVING THE SWING PATTERN---- MUCH PLANNING. ON SOME DAYS, MUCH OF THE PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE---- CONDUCTED ON AUTOPILOT. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TYPE---- OF PRACTICE?-------------------------------------------------------- EARLY THEORETICAL VIEWS---- OF MOTOR LEARNING SUGGESTED THAT THE MOTOR COMMANDS AND THE SENSORY---- FEEDBACK THAT-RESULTED FROM THE MOVEMENT-WERE ALL THAT NEEDED---- TO BE STORED IN MEMORY FOR LEARNING TO OCCUR. BY THIS VIEW, THINKING---- WAS NOT TOO IMPORTANT FOR PURPOSES OR MOTOR LEARNING. MORE RECENT---- VIEWS STRESS THE ROLE OF COGNITION IN MOTOR SKILLS. IN GENERAL,---- COGNITION REFERS TO A COLLECTIVE GROUP OF THOUGHT PROCESSES.---- THE HOCKEY GOALIE TRIES TO PREDICT THE DIRECTION OF A SHOT BY---- SEARCHING FOR PERCEPTUAL CLUES THAT PROVIDE ADVANCE INFORMATION.---- THE GOLFER WITHOUT A CLEAR SHOT TO THE GREEN TRIES TO REMEMBER---- HOW TO HIT A CONTROLLED FADE. THE FIGURE SKATER ABOUT TO PERFORM---- A TRIPLE AXLE JUMP FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A TRIPLE TOE LOOP---- MUST PREPARE FOR THIS COMBINED ACTION WITH THE FLEXIBILITY IN---- MIND TO CHANGE THE PLAN IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG. ALL OF THESE---- ARE EXAMPLES OF DECISION- MAKING PROCESSES REGARDING THE ANTICIPATION,---- PLANNING, REGULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF MOTOR PERFORMANCE.-------------------------------------------------------- ACCEPTING THAT COGNITION---- PLAYS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN PERFORMING MOTOR SKILLS, THE QUESTION---- OF THE ROLE OF COGNITION DURING PRACTICE TAKES ON MORE IMPORTANCE.---- MOTOR LEARNING INVOLVES MORE THAN STORING SENSORY AND MOTOR INFORMATION---- THAT ARISES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MOVEMENT. SKILL IS HIGHLY COGNITIVE,---- AND THE COGNITIVE PROCESSES THAT SUBSERVE MOVEMENT MUST BE PRACTICED---- AS WELL. OUR GOAL IN THIS PAPER IS TO HIGHLIGHT SOME SELECTED---- ISSUES OF MAJOR LEARNING RESEARCH THAT ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE---- OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES DURING PRACTICE.-------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT---- THE DIFFERENCES THAT-ARISE AS A-CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENT PRACTICE---- CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF--- COGNITIVE EFFORT----. IN GENERAL, COGNITIVE---- EFFORT REFERS TO THE MENTAL WORK INVOLVED IN MAKING DECISIONS.---- IN SOME CASES, PRACTICE CONDITIONS RESULT IN-MORE INTENSE USE---- OF PROCESSING RESOURCES. IN OTHER CASES RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT---- DIFFERENT TYPES OF DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES ARE AFFECTED BY---- PRACTICE CONDITIONS. USING COGNITIVE EFFORT AS A FOCAL POINT,---- ONE-CAN VIEW PRACTICE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER PROMOTE OR---- IMPEDE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES THAT UNDERSCORE MOVEMENT.-------------------------------------------------------- IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP---- THE CONCEPT OF COGNITIVE EFFORT FROM RESEARCH ON THREE DISTINCT---- AREAS OR MOTOR LEARNING RESEARCH. FIRST, WE REVIEW SOME RECENT---- FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH ON MODELING THAT WATCHING AN UNSKILLED---- MODEL LEARN A MOTOR SKILL CAN BENEFIT THE OBSERVER BY PROVIDING---- A VICARIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS.---- THIS SECTION IS FOLLOWED BY A REVIEW OF-SOME FINDINGS THAT AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK CAN SOMETIMES BE PRESENTED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BE DETRIMENTAL---- TO LEARNING. THE FINAL AREA OF RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT, WHILE---- DRILL-TYPE PRACTICE CONDITIONS CAN FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS DURING---- PRACTICE, SUCH CONDITIONS ALSO RESULT IN POOR RETENTION AND TRANSFER.---- COLLECTIVELY, THESE THREE AREAS OF RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT LEARNING---- IS PROMOTED WHEN THE PRACTICE CONDITIONS PROMOTE-COGNITIVE EFFORT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MODEL SKILL------- LEVEL AND OBSERVATIONAL---- LEARNING------------ DEMONSTRATING-A MOTOR SKILL TO CLASS OF STUDENTS IS ONE OF---- THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOLS IN TEACHING. DESPITE A STRONG RESEARCH---- BASE THAT SUPPORTS THE USE OF MODELS, THERE ARE MANY INSTANCE---- IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODEL DETERMINE ITS POTENTIAL---- USEFULNESS. FOR INSTANCE, FEW WOULD CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTION---- THAT-EXPERTS IN-A MOTOR SKILL MAKE GOOD MODELS FOR THE PURPOSES---- OF DEMONSTRATION. BUT ARE EXPERTS ALWAYS THE BEST MODELS TO USE?------------------------------------------------- EARLY THEORETICAL SUPPORT---- FOR THE USE OF EXPERT MODELS WAS OFFERED BY SHEFFIELD. ACCORDING---- TO HIS VIEW, SYMBOLIC BEHAVIOR COULD BE CODED AND MODELED BY---- MEANS OF A--- PERCEPTUAL BLUEPRINT,---- A PRECISE REPRESENTATION---- OF THE PERCEPTUAL DEMANDS OR THE TASK, THE PURPOSE OF THE BLUEPRINT---- WAS TO SERVE BOTH AS A-REPRESENTATION OF WHAT TO DO AND AS-A---- REFERENT FOR MAKING CORRECTIONS. OBSERVATION PROVIDED A MEANS---- BY WHICH THE PERCEPTUAL BLUEPRINT COULD BE ACQUIRED, AND SHEFFIELD'S---- THEORY PROVIDED A RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF EXPERTS AS OPTIMAL---- MODELS.-------------------------------------------------------- THE USE OF EXPERT MODELS---- ALSO HAS CONSIDERABLE PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT, AS ONE MAY DISCOVER---- FROM A VISIT TO THE SPORTS INSTRUCTION SECTION OF A VIDEO STORE-------------------------------------------------------- THESE TAPES (ON SPORTS---- SUCH AS, GOLF TENNIS, SKIING, BOWLING, ETC.) OFTEN FEATURE A---- REPETITIVE-VIEW OF TOP-LEVEL ATHLETES-DEMONSTRATING A PARTICULAR---- MOTOR SKILL- BUT, ARE THESE TYPES OF VIDEO USEFUL?-THERE ARE ----BOTH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL-REASONS TO-BE SKEPTICAL.-------------------------------------------------------- IN 1984, THE UNITED STATES---- NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WAS ASKED BY ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE---- TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE VALUE OF VARIOUS INSTRUCTIONAL---- TECHNIQUES. ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES INVESTIGATED WAS A SERIES OF---- TAPES KNOWN AS SYBERVISION. THE USE OF EXPERT MODELS FROM WHICH---- TO LEARN SPORT SKILLS SUCH AS TENNIS, GOLF, OR-BOWLING WAS JUSTIFIED---- BY THEIR----- "NEUROMUSCULAR-PROGRAMMING-----" THEORY. ACCORDING---- TO THE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY SYBERVISION,----- "THE MORE---- YOU SEE AND HEAR PURE MOVEMENT, THE DEEPER IT BECOMES IMPRINTED---- IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM-- ...- AND THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE-TO---- PERFORM IT AS A CONDITIONED REFLEX-----". HOWEVER, THE COMMITTEE---- FOUND NO SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTED THESE CLAIMS.-------------------------------------------------------- THESE CONCLUSIONS, SHOULD---- NOT BE ALL THAT SURPRISING. THE USE OF EXPERTS AS MODELS APPEARS---- TO ENCOURAGE MORE THE PROCESS OF IMITATION THAN TRUE LEARNING---- THROUGH OBSERVATION. WHEN WATCHING THESE VIDEOS, THE OBSERVER---- IS ENCOURAGED TO MIMIC WHAT THE MODEL HAS DEMONSTRATED. BANDURA,---- A PIONEER IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL MODELING, DISCREDITS IMITATION---- AS A METHOD THAT MINIMIZES THE POWER OF MODELING. IN HIS WORDS,--------- "MODELING IMPARTS CONCEPTIONS-AND RULES FOR GENERATING VARIANT---- FORMS OF BEHAVIOR TO SUIT DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND CIRCUMSTANCES.---- IN SKILL ACQUISITION, MODELING IS MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED---- AS RULE LEARNING THAN AS RESPONSE MIMICRY-----".-------------------------------------------------------- THE REPETITIOUS NATURE---- OF THE SKILLS DEMONSTRATED BY EXPERTS IN THESE VIDEOS ALSO APPEARS---- TO IMPLY THAT REPEATED EXPOSURE TO A DESIRABLE PERFORMANCE WILL--------- "STAMP IN-----" A REPRESENTATION-OF CONSISTENT, ERRORLESS---- PERFORMANCE. THIS ASSUMPTION, HOWEVER, APPEARS TO IGNORE THE---- FACT THAT ERRORLESS PRACTICE AND ROLE REPETITION ARE POOR LEARNING---- STRATEGIES.-------------------------------------------------------- ALTHOUGH RESEARCH SUGGESTS---- THAT OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING DOES OCCUR USING EXPERT MODELS, THE---- FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A NOVICE WHO IS LEARNING A MOTOR SKILL---- CAN ALSO BE AN EFFECTIVE MODEL. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THIS RESEARCH---- IS RECENT, IT WAS ANTICIPATED MANY YEARS AGO BY TWITMYER. HE---- COMPARED TWO GROUPS OF OBJECTS WHO LEARNED TO TRACE A PENCIL---- MAZE WHILE BLINDFOLDED. SUBJECTS IN ONE GROUP (THE LEARNING MODELS),---- PRACTICED THE TASK ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS. DURING HIS TIME, SUBJECTS---- IN IS SECOND GROUP (THE OBSERVERS) WATCHED AND RECORDED (HE RESULTS---- OF THE LEARNING MODELS. THESE OBSERVERS THEN PERFORMED THE TASK---- ON A THIRD DAY. SINCE THE LEARNING MODELS PERFORMED WITHOUT PREVIOUS---- OBSERVATION OF A MODEL,-THEIR RESULTS WERE USED AS CONTROL DATA. ----THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBSERVERS WAS BETTER THAN THE MODELS'---- PERFORMANCE ON THE VERY-FIRST TRIAL, AND REMAINED BETTER THROUGHOUT---- THE LEARNING SESSION.-------------------------------------------------------- ALTHOUGH TWITMYER MAY---- HAVE DONE THE FIRST STUDY USING UNSKILLED MODELS IN AN OBSERVATION---- EXPERIMENT, A STUDY BY ADAMS------ HAS SPARKED THE RECENT SEARCH---- EFFORTS. SIMILAR TO THE TWITMYER METHOD, A-MODEL PRACTICED IN---- THE PRESENCE OF AN OBSERVER, AFTER WHICH THE OBSERVER PRACTICED---- THE TASK. IN ADAMS' STUDY, THE MODEL PRACTICED A MOVEMENT TIMING---- TASK FOR 50 TRIALS AND OBSERVED UNDER ONE OF-TWO CONDITIONS.---- THE TWO GROUPS OF OBSERVERS DIFFERED IN TERMS THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- PROVIDED WHILE OBSERVING: ONE GROUP RECEIVED THE MOVEMENT TIME---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK THAT WAS DELIVERED TO THE MODEL WHEREAS THE---- OTHER GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (THIS---- FEEDBACK WAS CRUCIAL FOR THE MODEL TO LEARN THE TASK). ADAMS---- FOUND THAT THE OBSERVERS PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE MODELS, WITH---- THE BEST PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED BY THE OBSERVERS WHO ALSO RECEIVED---- THE MODELS' AUGMENTED FEEDBACK.-------------------------------------------------------- BUT HOW EFFECTIVE IS---- A LEARNING MODEL WHEN DIRECTLY COMPARED TO AN-EXPERT MODEL? A---- FEW-STUDIES HAVE-MADE THIS COMPARISON, BUT THE RESULTS-ARE MIXED.---------------------------------------------------------EXPERIMENTS-BY WEIR AND---- LEAVITT AND-BY POLLOCK-AND LEE FOUND NO DIFFERENCES DUE TO THE---- PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF THE MODEL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE POLLOCK AND---- LEE STUDY, SUBJECTS WATCHED A MODEL PERFORM 15 TRIALS ON A COMPUTER---- GAME THAT REQUIRED PURSUIT TRACKING. THE BENEFIT DUE TO PREVIOUS---- OBSERVATION WAS EVIDENT ON THE FIRST POST-OBSERVATIONAL TRIAL,---- AND THIS BENEFIT REMAINED THROUGHOUT PRACTISE. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE---- DUE TO THE MODEL'S SKILL LEVEL.-------------------------------------------------------- HOWEVER, A STUDY BY MCCULLAGH---- AND CAIRD DID FIND THAT PERFORMANCE AFTER WATCHING A LEARNING---- MODEL WAS BETTER THAN AFTER WATCHING AN EXPERT MODEL. MCCULLAGH---- AND CAIRDS'S TASK WAS SIMILAR TO THE TASK USED BY ADAMS. SUBJECTS---- CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SIX ACQUISITION BLOCKS. EACH BLOCK INCLUDED---- WATCHING FIVE PERFORMANCES OF A MODEL, FOLLOWED BY FIVE PERFORMANCE---- TRIALS. THE DIFFERENT OBSERVATION GROUPS WATCHED EITHER AN EXPERT---- MODEL OR A LEARNING MODEL. WHILE WATCHING THE LEARNING MODEL,---- GROUPS OF OBSERVERS EITHER RECEIVED THE MODEL'S AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- AFTER EACH ATTEMPT OR DID NOT RECEIVE THE FEEDBACK (SIMILAR TO---- ADAM'S METHOD).-------------------------------------------------------- THE FINDINGS OF THE OBSERVERS'---- PERFORMANCE TRIALS DURING ACQUISITION, AN IMMEDIATE RETENTION---- TEST, A RETENTION TEST 1 DAY LATER, AND A DELAYED TRANSFER TEST---- (TO A NOVEL TIMING GOAL) ARE CLEAR. OBSERVATION OF THE LEARNING---- MODEL WHILE ALSO RECEIVING THE MODEL'S AUGMENTED FEEDBACK RESULTED---- IN THE BEST OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING.-------------------------------------------------------- WHILE STUDIES COMPARING---- THE VALUE OF EXPERT VERSUS LEARNING MODELS IN ACQUIRING SPORT ----SKILLS-HAS BEGUN,-WE CAN CONJECTURE THAT AT A MINIMUM, OBSERVING---- A LEARNING MODEL WILL BE NO LESS EFFECTIVE THAN OBSERVING AN---- EXPERT MODEL. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY EVEN BE MORE-EFFECTIVE.-----THE-SKILL LEVEL OF THE MODEL-HAS AN IMPACT ON THE-OBSERVER'S-----COGNITIVE EFFORT TO LEARN FROM THE MOTOR BEHAVIOR THAT WAS DEMONSTRATED.---- AN-EXPERT MODEL PROVIDES A PRECISE REPRESENTATION OF HOW A SKILLED---- ACTION SHOULD BE PERFORMED. HOWEVER, A LEARNING MODEL MORE ACTIVELY---- ENGAGES THE OBSERVER IN THE PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESSES THAT CHARACTERIZE---- LEARNING. THE OBSERVER CAN CLEARLY OBSERVE THE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR---- OF THE MODEL AND THE SUCCESS OF THE MODEL'S SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS---- TO REDUCE PERFORMANCE ERROR. INDEED, OBSERVERS HAVE REPORTED---- TO US THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUPPRESS MAKING COMMENTS TO A---- LIVE, LEARNING MODEL WHEN THE MODEL FAILED TO MAKE AN OBVIOUS ----CORRECTION OF A MOVEMENT-BEHAVIOR. ON IMPLICATION OF THIS-FINDING---- IS THAT-OBSERVING THE-POSSIBLE ERRORS THAT CAN BE MADE ON A TASK-----AND THE SUCCESS OF VARIOUS ATTEMPTS-TO SOLVE THESE ERRORS PROVIDES---- A CONCEPTUAL INSIGHT INTO THE COGNITIVE BASIS OF THE TASK TO---- BE LEARNED. SUCH A PROCESS SEEMS WELL-SUITED TO THE SKILL OBSERVATION---- PROCESS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE GUIDING----------------------- INFLUENCE---- OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK-------------------------------------------------------- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK-----REFERS TO INFORMATION THAT A LEARNER DOES NOT NORMALLY RECEIVE-----DIRECTLY FROM THE SENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, A TENNIS PLAYER WILL KNOW---- THAT THE SERVE WAS NOT GOOD-BECAUSE THE BALL HIT THE NET. HOWEVER,---- THE EXACT-REASON FOR-THIS RESULT-MY NOT BE OBVIOUS. AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK REFERS-TO MAKING EXPLICIT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT-BE DIFFICULT,---- IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO KNOW IMPLICITLY. USUALLY THIS INFORMATION---- IS AUGMENTED BY A TEACHER OR COACH USING VERBAL STATEMENTS OR---- BY MEANS OF VISUAL AIDS. IN THIS WAY, THE INFORMATION IS----- "FED---- BACK-----" TO THE LEARNER.-------------------------------------------------------- FOR YEARS, RESEARCHERS---- AND EDUCATORS SEEMED CONTENT WITH THE FOLLOWING GENERAL VIEW---- ON THE ROLE OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IN MOTOR LEARNING: THE USE---- OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHENEVER IT IS PROVIDED---- AS SOON AFTER PERFORMANCE AS POSSIBLE, AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE,---- AND IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REDUCE PERFORMANCE ERRORS AS EFFICIENTLY---- AS POSSIBLE. THAT VIEW WAS CHALLENGED AT FEW YEARS AGO BY RICHARD---- SCHMIDT AND HIS COLLEAGUES.-------------------------------------------------------- SCHMIDT MADE SOME RATHER---- STARTLING CONCLUSIONS AFTER REEXAMINING SOME PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED---- EXPERIMENTS AND CONDUCTING NEW STUDIES. THE FIRST CONCLUSION---- WAS THAT THE GENERAL VIEW ON AUGMENTED FEEDBACK GIVEN ABOVE WAS---- BASED LARGELY ON DATA GATHERED DURING PRACTICE. SCHMIDT ARGUED---- THAT THIS WAS WEAK METHODOLOGY SINCE CHANGES DURING PRACTICE---- REFLECTED TEMPORARY INFLUENCES ON PERFORMANCE AND NOT ALWAYS---- TRUE LEARNING EFFECTS. A BETTER ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING WAS PROVIDED---- BY RETENTION AND TRANSFER TESTS AFTER TEMPORARY EFFECTS NO LONGER---- EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON PERFORMANCE. THE SECOND CONCLUSION WAS---- THAT-IF THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK LITERATURE WAS RE-EVALUATED USING---- RETENTION AND TRANSFER DATA, THE EVIDENCE POINTED TO A VIEW THAT---- WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVAILING VIEW. WE BEGIN BY CONSIDERING---- SOME OF THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK VARIABLES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON---- LEARNING, THEN DESCRIBE SCHMIDT'S IDEAS ABOUT THE GUIDING ROLE---- OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK ON MOTOR LEARNING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ERROR ESTIMATION--------------------------- AND TEMPORAL DELAY-------------------------------------------------------- ONE VIEW FOR---- OPTIMIZING THE BENEFITS OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS TO PRESENT---- THE FEEDBACK AS SOON AFTER MOVEMENT AS POSSIBLE. FINDINGS INDICATED---- A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION. IN THESE STUDIES, AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- WAS PROVIDED EITHER INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE COMPLETION OF A---- MOVEMENT OR AFTER AN 8-SECOND DELAY. SUBJECTS THAT RECEIVED THIS---- SHORT DELAY DURING PRACTICE EITHER SAT SILENTLY DURING THE INTERVAL---- OR ATTEMPTED TO ESTIMATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO RECEIVE. LEARNING WAS ASSESSED WHEN SUBJECTS---- AGAIN PERFORMED THE TASK 10 MINUTES AND 2 DAYS AFTER THE PRACTICE---- PERIOD. ALL GROUPS PERFORMED WITHOUT AUGMENTED FEEDBACK DURING---- THESE RETENTION TESTS.-------------------------------------------------------- THERE WAS LITTLE DIFFERENCE---- BETWEEN THE GROUPS DURING THE PRACTICE (ACQUISITION) PERIOD.---- HOWEVER, A PATTERN OF RESULTS BEGAN TO EMERGE AFTER 10 MINUTES---- THAT WAS FURTHER CLARIFIED ON THE 2-DAY RETENTION TEST. THIS---- PATTERN OF RESULTS INDICATED (A) RELATIVELY GOOD RETENTION FOLLOWING---- PRACTICE IN WHICH ESTIMATION OF THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS MADE---- DURING THE DELAY PERIOD AND (B) RELATIVELY POOR RESULTS FOR THE---- GROUP THAT WAS GIVEN INSTANTANEOUS AUGMENTED FEEDBACK. THE DELAYED---- GROUP PERFORMED AT AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL. THESE FINDINGS NOT---- ONLY ARGUED AGAINST THE PREVAILING VIEW OF PROVIDING FEEDBACK---- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER A MOVEMENT BUT SUGGESTED THAT, IN FACT,---- SUCH A PROCEDURE COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO LEARNING. MOREOVER,---- THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT ESTIMATING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ERROR---- PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK HAD AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT---- TO LEARNING BEYOND THAT OF SIMPLY DELAYING THE FEEDBACK.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUMMARY FEEDBACK-------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY FEEDBACK---- IS RELATED TO THE TEMPORAL DELAY OF FEEDBACK DISCUSSED ABOVE.---- IN THIS METHOD, FEEDBACK IS DELAYED UNTIL AFTER A SERIES OF TRIALS---- HAVE BEEN COMPLETED; FEEDBACK IS THEN PROVIDED IN A MANNER THAT---- SUMMARIZES THE RECEDING TRIALSAN EXPERIMENT BY SCHMIDT, YOUNG,---- SHAPIRO AND SWINNEN ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECTS OF SUMMARY FEEDBACK-------------------------------------------------------- SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY---- WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF TRIALS---- THAT WERE SUMMARIZED ON A GRAPH AND PRESENTED TO THE SUBJECT---- AS AUGMENTED FEEDBACK. IN THE----- "SUM----- 1" GROUP, FEEDBACK---- WAS PROVIDED AFTER EVERY TRIAL. IN THE----- "SUM----- 5",----- "SUM--------- 10" AND----- "SUM----- 15" GROUPS, FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED---- ON A GRAPH ABOUT THE 5, 10 OR 15 PRECEDING TRIALS, ILLUSTRATING---- HOW PERFORMANCE EITHER CHANGED OR REMAINED CONSISTENT OVER TRIALS.---- IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED TEAS OF RETENTION FOLLOWED-THE PRACTICE---- PERIOD.-------------------------------------------------------- TWO SETS OF FINDINGS---- ARE IMPORTANT. FIRST ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED---- TO SIZE OF THE SUMMARY; THE LARGER THE SUMMARY THE POORER THE---- ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE. SECOND, DELAYED RETENTION PERFORMANCE---- WAS ACHIEVED BY THE----- "SUM----- 15" AND----- "SUM--------- 10" GROUPS, AND THE WORST PERFORMANCE BY THE----- "SUM----- 5" AND--------- "SUM----- 1" GROUPS. THESE FINDINGS ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING---- BECAUSE OR THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS THAT THE SUMMARY CONDITIONS HAD---- ON THE PRACTICE PERFORMANCE AND ON LEARNING AND BECAUSE OF THE---- DIRECT FINDINGS TO TEACHING SPORT SKILLS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RELATIVE FREQUENCY-------------------------------------------------------- THE FREQUENCY---- OF PROVIDING AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS ANOTHER OF THE PREVAILING---- VIEWS THAT WAS CHALLENGED BY SCHMIDT. THE BELIEF WAS THAT THE---- ABSOLUTE FREQUENCY OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK (I.E. THE NUMBER OF---- TIMES THAT FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED) WAS A CRITICAL VARIABLE IN---- LEARNING, BUT THAT RELATIVE FREQUENCY (THE RATIO OF FEEDBACK-PROVIDED---- TRIALS TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRIALS) WAS NOT AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE---- FOR LEARNING. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS VIEW---- WAS BASED ON DATA FROM THE PRACTICE PERIOD RATHER THAN FROM RETENTION---- TESTS. IN THEIR REVIEW OF THIS LITERATURE, SALMONI ET ALL. (1984)---- FOUND A FEW STUDIES THAT INCLUDED RETENTION TESTS FOLLOWING RELATIVE---- FREQUENCY MANIPULATIONS. SURPRISINGLY, THESE STUDIES SHOWED THAT---- RELATIVE FREQUENCY MIGHT INDEED BE AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN LEARNING---- - THAT--- LOW---- RELATIVE FREQUENCIES MIGHT HE BETTER THAN--- HIGH-------- RELATIVE FREQUENCIES OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK. SUBSEQUENT STUDIES---- HAVE SINCE CONFIRMED THESE EFFECTS.-------------------------------------------------------- AN INTERESTING COROLLARY---- TO THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY EFFECTS HAS ALSO EMERGED. USING A MOVEMENT---- TIMING TASK, SHERWOOD PROVIDED SUBJECTS WITH-AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- ONLY WHEN THEIR ERRORS EXCEEDED CERTAIN TOLERANCE LIMITS ABOUT---- THE GOAL. FOR ONE GROUP OF SUBJECTS, AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED---- ON EVERY TRIAL (A----- "0% BANDWIDTH-----"). FOR OTHER SUBJECTS,---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED ONLY WHEN PERFORMANCE ERROR WAS---- GREATER THAN +/- 5%, OR GREATER THAN +/- 10% OF THE GOAL. BY---- THIS MANIPULATION, SHERWOOD ALSO INFLUENCED THE FREQUENCY SCHEDULE---- BY WHICH AUGMENTED FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED (SINCE FEEDBACK WAS---- NOT PROVIDED FOR TRIALS ON WHICH PERFORMANCE WAS WITHIN THE BANDWIDTH---- LIMITS).-------------------------------------------------------- EARLY IN PRACTICE, WHEN---- MANY ERRORS OCCURRED, THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- WAS FAIRLY HIGH. HOWEVER, AS PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE---- OVER PRACTICE, THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY BECAME LESS FREQUENT. PERFORMANCE---- ON A RETENTION TEST WAS BEST FOR THE GROUP THAT HAD RECEIVED---- THE 10% BANDWIDTH AND POOREST FOR THE 0% BANDWIDTH GROUP, WITH---- THE 5% GROUP PERFORMING AT AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL. AT A MINIMUM,---- THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE EFFECTS OF REDUCED RELATIVE---- FREQUENCY, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS THAT THE BANDWIDTH MANIPULATION---- HAS AN ADDITIONAL LEARNING EFFECT. THE OTHER SIMILARITY IS THAT--------- "FADING-----" THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF FEEDBACK OVER PRACTICE---- (GIVING FREQUENT FEEDBACK EARLY IN PRACTICE AND INFREQUENTLY---- LATER) IS BOTH AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND ONE THAT OCCURS AS A---- NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE BANDWIDTH PROCEDURE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A GUIDANCE ROLE--------------------------- FOR AUGMENTED FEEDBACK-------------------------------------------------------- COLLECTIVELY,---- THESE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BY SCHMIDT AS EVIDENCE IN---- SUPPORT OF A GUIDANCE ROLE (OR AUGMENTED FEEDBACK. ALTHOUGH AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK CAN BE USEFUL UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES, PROVIDING---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO LEARNING UNDER OTHER---- CONDITIONS. IN GENERAL, THESE CONDITIONS OCCUR (A) WHEN AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK IS NECESSARY FOR LEARNING TO OCCUR AND (B) WHEN AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK IS PRESENTED SUCH THAT IT GUIDES THE LEARNER TOWARD---- CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. IN THESE CASES, THE LEARNER BECOMES---- TOO RELIANT UPON THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK TO CORRECT MOVEMENT ERRORS.---- FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROVISION OF INSTANTANEOUS FEEDBACK DURING PRACTICE---- TENDS TO DETRACT THE LEARNER FROM INTERPRETING INTRINSIC SOURCES---- OF FEEDBACK, SUCH AS VISION AND PROPRIOCEPTION. SCHMIDT SUGGESTS---- THAT IT IS THESE SOURCES OF-FEEDBACK THAT ONE MUST LEARN TO INTERPRET---- SINCE THEY WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO THE LEARNER. AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK (SUCH AS-THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM A TEACHER) WILL---- NOT ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE (E.G., DURING A GAME). INDEED, THE GOAL---- IN MOST LEARNING SITUATIONS IS FOR THE LEARNER TO BECOME INDEPENDENT---- OF THE TEACHER. LEARNING TO RELY UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED---- BY THESE PEOPLE WILL ULTIMATELY BE DETRIMENTAL-TO ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE.-------------------------------------------------------- FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE,---- THE SWINNEN SHOWED THAT ENCOURAGING SUBJECTS TO ESTIMATE THEIR---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK PRODUCED A BENEFIT TO LEARNING BEYOND THAT---- ACHIEVED BY SIMPLY DELAYING THE INSTANTANEOUS PROVISION OF THE---- FEEDBACK. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE COGNITIVE EFFORT IN ATTEMPTING---- TO LEARN TO INTERPRET ONE'-----S OWN INTRINSIC FEEDBACK, IN COMBINATION---- WITH AUGMENTED FEEDBACK, CAN BE A POTENT INFLUENCE ON LEARNING.---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK MIGHT BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO LEARNING WHEN---- IT SERVES TO AUGMENT THE COGNITIVE EFFORTS IN LEARNING SELF-EVALUATION---- SKILLS USING THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE---- DURING COMPETITION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE-------------------------------------------------------- ANOTHER INTRIGUING---- RESEARCH ISSUE INVESTIGATED IN RECENT YEARS IS THE CONTEXTUAL---- INTERFERENCE EFFECT. THIS FINDING WAS FIRST STUDIED BY SHEA AND---- MORGAN AND HAS BEEN REPLICATED MANY TIMES SINCE. IN THE SHEA---- AND MORGAN STUDY, TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS EACH LEARNED THESE SIMPLE---- LABORATORY TASKS. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PRACTICE WERE IDENTICAL---- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ORDER IN WHICH THE TASKS WERE PRACTICED.---- UNDER THE BLOCKED ORDER, ALL PRACTICE TRIALS ON ONE OF THE TASKS---- WERE COMPLETED BEFORE ANOTHER TASK WAS UNDERTAKEN. THIS PROCEDURE---- IS SIMILAR TO PRACTICE----- "DRILLS-----" BECAUSE OF THE REPETITIVE---- NATURE OF THE PRACTICE.-------------------------------------------------------- IN CONTRAST, THE OTHER---- GROUP PRACTICED THE TASKS IN A RANDOM ORDER, SUCH THAT THEY WERE---- SWITCHING FROM ONE TASK TO ANOTHER THROUGHOUT PRACTICE. THE RANDOM---- ORDER RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLY MORE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN TASKS---- COMPARED TO A BLOCKED ORDER. THUS, IT WAS NOT TOO SURPRISING---- THAT RANDOM PRACTICE RESULTED IN MUCH POORER ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE---- THAN BLOCKED PRACTICE.-------------------------------------------------------- WHAT WAS RATHER SURPRISING---- WERE THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO GROUPS ON RETENTION TESTS CONDUCTED---- MINUTES AND DAYS LATER. ON BOTH RETENTION TESTS THE RANDOM GROUP---- PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE BLOCKED GROUP.-------------------------------------------------------- THESE RESULTS RESEMBLE---- THE FINDINGS OF THE SUMMARY EXPERIMENT EARLIER, IN WHICH THE---- SAME CONDITIONS THAT LED TO POOR ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE ALSO---- LED TO VERY GOOD RETENTION. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF RANDOM AND---- BLOCKED PRACTICE ORDERS, IT WAS NOT THE MANIPULATION OF AUGMENTED---- FEEDBACK BUT THE INTERFERENCE ARISING FROM THE ORDER BY WHICH---- THE TASKS WERE PRACTICED THAT PRODUCED THE RESULTS. HENCE, THE---- CAUSE FOR THE CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE FINDINGS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED---- IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT THEORETICAL CONSTRAINTS THAN DESCRIBED---- FOR THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK FINDINGS.-------------------------------------------------------- ONE ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTEXTUAL---- INTERFERENCE EFFECT IS THAT RANDOM PRACTICE ENCOURAGES A LEARNER---- TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE METHODS AND STRATEGIES USED FOR PERFORMING---- THE DIFFERENT TASKS. SWITCHING BETWEEN TASKS DURING PRACTICE---- PROVIDES THE LEARNER WITH BETTER CONTRASTIVE KNOWLEDGE THAN THE---- DRILL, REPETITIVE-TYPE PRACTICE THAT OCCURS UNDER A BLOCKED ORDER.---- THIS CONTRAST BETWEEN TASKS MAKES LEARNING EACH TASK MORE DISTINCTIVE---- AND MEMORABLE, RESULTING IN THE ADVANTAGES SEEN LATER IN RETENTION.-------------------------------------------------------- ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR---- THE CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECT CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED USING---- AN ANALOGY. IF YOU ARE ASKED TO MENTALLY MULTIPLY TWO NUMBERS---- (E.G. 34 X 26=?), IT WOULD TAKE SOME WORK, BUT COULD BE DONE---- WITH EFFORT. IF THE SAME QUESTION WERE ASKED A SHORT TIME LATER,---- THE ANSWER COULD BE GIVEN RIGHT AWAY IF THE SOLUTION FROM THE---- PREVIOUS MENIAL EFFORT WAS STILL IN WORKING MEMORY.-------------------------------------------------------- IF HOWEVER, THAT ANSWER---- HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN, THEN THE QUESTION WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLVED---- AGAIN. LEE AND MAGILL USED A SIMILAR IDEA TO EXPLAIN THE CONTEXTUAL---- INTERTERETICE EFFECT. RANDOM PRACTICE REQUIRES A LEARNER TO APPROACH---- A TASK BY DEVELOPING A STRATEGY OR PLAN OF ACTION. HOWEVER, SUCH---- A PLAN IS INAPPROPRIATE TO MAINTAIN IN MEMORY SINCE THE TASK---- ON THE NEXT TRIAL IS DIFFERENT. THUS, A NEW PLAN OF ACTION NEEDS---- TO BE DEVELOPED. BY THE TIME THE PREVIOUS TASK IS PERFORMED AGAIN,---- THE PLAN THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED FOR IT LAST TIME HAS BEEN LOST---- FROM MEMORY, AND A NEW PLAN OF ACTION MUST BE DEVELOPED. THIS---- PROCESS CONTINUES THROUGHOUT RANDOM PRACTICE. IN CONTRAST, THE---- SAME PLAN OF ACTION CAN BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN DURING BLOCKED---- PRACTICE SINCE THE SAME TASK IS PRACTICED REPEATEDLY. THE CONSEQUENCE---- IS THAT HAVING LEARNED TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION WHEN NECESSARY---- (UNDER RANDOM PRACTICE) MAKES THE LEARNING BOTH MORE MEMORABLE---- AND BETTER SUITED FOR NOVEL PERFORMANCE SIMULATIONS.-------------------------------------------------------- BOTH THEORETICAL ORIENTATIONS---- TO THE CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECT HAVE RECEIVED QUITE A BIT---- OF EMPIRICAL ATTENTION. IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THERE---- HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS UNDERTAKEN TO EXAMINE THE CONTEXTUAL---- INTERFERENCE EFFECT IN ACQUIRING SPORT SKILLS, AND THE FINDINGS---- APPEAR TO REPLICATE THE FINDINGS FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS---- QUITE WELL. PRACTICE AND RETENTION /TRANSFER FINDINGS SHOWING---- THE----- "TYPICAL-----" BLOCKED/RANDOM DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN---- FOUND FOR-LEARNING BADMINTON SERVES AND IN RIFLE SHOOTING.---------------------------------------------------------MOST OF THE-LABORATORY-----EXPERIMENTS-AND FIELD TESTS OF CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECTS---- HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED USING SUBJECTS WHO WERE UNSKILLED AT THE---- TASKS TO BE LEARNED. HOWEVER, IN A RECENT STUDY. HALL, DOMINGUES,---- AND CAVAZOS FOUND INTERESTING CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECTS---- FOR ATHLETES WHO HAD ALREADY ACHIEVED A HIGH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE.---- IN THIS STUDY, COLLEGE-LEVEL BASEBALL PLAYERS RECEIVED TWO SESSIONS---- OF EXTRA BATTING PRACTICE PER WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS. ONE GROUP OF---- SUBJECTS RECEIVED 15 CURVE BALLS, 15 FAST BALLS AND 15 CHANGE-UPS---- IN A BLOCKED ORDER DURING EACH SESSION. ANOTHER GROUP OF SUBJECTS---- RECEIVED THE SAME NUMBER AND TYPES OF PITCHES IN A RANDOM ORDER.---- A CONTROL GROUP OF SUBJECTS RECEIVED NO EXTRA BATTING PRACTICE.---- SCORES (IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SOLID HITS) WERE RECORDED ON-----A RANDOM PRETEST, ON TWO PRACTICE SESSIONS (SESSIONS 5 AND 8),---- AND ON BOTH A RANDOMLY ORDERED AND A BLOCKED ORDERED TRANSFER---- TEST.---------------------------------------------------------SEVERAL POINTS OF INTEREST---- FROM THE HALL STUDY ARE NOTABLE. FIRST, THE EXTRA BATTING PRACTICE---- IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AS NOTED BY THE BETTER PERFORMANCE ON THE --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CRITERION TASK.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- COGNITIVE EFFORT-------------------------------------------------------- THE THREE AREAS---- OF RESEARCH DISCUSSED ABOVE PROVIDE RATHER DIVERSE EXAMPLES OF---- COGNITIVE EFFORT IN MOTOR SKILL LEARNING. IN EACH AREA OF RESEARCH---- WE HAVE PROVIDED EXAMPLES THAT ILLUSTRATE HOW CONDITIONS OF PRACTICE---- EITHER PROMOTED OR DIMINISHED THE DECISION-MAKING ACTIVITIES---- OF THE SUBJECT LEARNING A MOTOR SKILL.-------------------------------------------------------- SOME INSTRUCTORS FEEL---- THAT WATCHING THE EXPERT EXECUTE THE SAME SPORT SKILL TIME AND---- AGAIN, WITH FLAWLESS PRECISION, SHOULD ENGENDER SOME TYPE OF---- PASSIVE DIFFUSION OF THAT KNOWLEDGE INTO THE OBSERVER. THE ADVANTAGES---- SEEN BY OBSERVING A LEARNING MODEL SUGGEST AN ADVANTAGE GAINED---- THROUGH A RATHER DIFFERENT PROCESS. IN THIS CASE, THE OBSERVER---- IS WATCHING THE MODEL ATTEMPT A PERFORMANCE. IF THE OBSERVER---- IS ALSO ABLE TO RECEIVE SOME FEEDBACK ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THAT---- PERFORMANCE, THEN THE OBSERVER IS IN THE POSITION TO JUDGE, INDEPENDENT---- OF THE MODEL, WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO NEXT. IN SHORT,---- THE OBSERVER BECOMES ACTIVELY INVOLVED, ALBEIT VICARIOUSLY, IN---- THE PROCESS OF LEARNING. THE OBSERVER JOINS THE LEARNING MODEL---- IN THE TRIAL-AND-ERROR PROCESS.-------------------------------------------------------- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IS---- A MEANS OF SUPPLEMENTING THE SOURCES OF FEEDBACK NORMALLY AVAILABLE---- TO AN INDIVIDUAL. AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION THAT COMPLEMENTS---- THE ALWAYS PRESENT SOURCES, AUGMENTED FEEDBACK SERVES A RESTRICTIVE---- ROLE. OPTIMALLY, AUGMENTED FEEDBACK SHOULD BE USED TO HELP A---- PERSON TO INTERPRET THE SOURCES OF FEEDBACK THAT ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE.---- AUGMENTED FEEDBACK SHOULD PROVIDE A KNOWLEDGE REFERENT, OR----- "RELIABILITY---- CHECK,-----" TO INSURE THAT INTRINSIC SOURCES OF FEEDBACK ARE---- CORRECTLY BEING INTERPRETED. FOR-EXAMPLE, THE REASONS FOR AN ----ERRANT GOLF SHOT ARE OFTEN AVAILABLE FROM WATCHING THE FLIGHT---- OF THE BALL. HOW TO INTERPRET-THIS INTRINS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IC FEEDBACK.-------------------------------------------------------- FOR AUGMENTED FEEDBACK---- TO SERVE ITS MOST-USEFUL ROLE, IT MUST BE GIVEN IN SUCH A WAY---- THAT IT HELPS WITHOUT DISCOURAGING THE PERFORMER FROM LEARNING---- TO INTERPRET INTRINSIC FEEDBACK. LEARNING TO INTERPRET ONE'-----S---- OWN INTRINSIC FEEDBACK REQUIRES COGNITIVE EFFORT. HOWEVER, THAT---- LEARNING CAN HE WEAKENED IF THE AUGMENTED FEEDBACK SERVES A ROLE---- IN WHICH IT UNDERMINES THE EFFORT TO LEARN TO INTERPRET ONE'-----S---- OWN INTRINSIC FEEDBACK. THERE IS NO NEED-FOR THE LEARNER TO TRY-----TO INTERPRET THE INTRINSIC FEEDBACK WHEN AUGMENTED FEEDBACK IS---- PROVIDED INSTANTANEOUSLY-UPON MOVEMENT COMPLETION AND WHEN IT---- FOLLOWS EVERY TRIAL. IN A WAY, COGNITIVE EFFORT IS-SUPPRESSED,---- YET PERFORMANCE IMPROVES QUITE WELL WITHOUT IT. ENCOURAGING THE---- INTERPRETATION OF PERFORMANCE, REDUCING THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY---- (COMBINED WITH PERFORMANCE BANDWIDTHS), AND INCREASING THE SUMMARY---- SIZES OF AUGMENTED FEEDBACK ALL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE COGNITIVE---- EFFORT TO INTERPRET INTRINSIC SOURCES OF INFORMATION.-------------------------------------------------------- PRACTICE DRILLS ARE GOOD---- PROCEDURES FOR LEARNING SKILLS. HOWEVER, MANY MOTOR SKILLS THAT---- ARE UNDERTAKEN DAILY DO NOT INVOLVE REPETITIVE ACTIONS. THIS---- PROBLEM BECAME CLEAR RECENTLY WHEN ONE OF US WAS TEACHING A BOY---- HOW TO TIE HIS SHOES. THE THOUGHT-PROCESSES THAT HE UNDERTOOK---- IN TYING HIS SHOES WERE CLEARLY EVIDENT BY THE SLOW AND DELIBERATE---- ACTIONS OF HIS FINGERS AS WORK. THESE WERE REPEATED ON THE NEXT-----SHOE, BUT TO A FAR LESS DEGREE. WE WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED-----IF HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO KEEP PRACTICING FOR----MINUTES. NO DOUBT,---- SUCCESS WOULD HAVE COME MORE QUICKLY AND EASILY. HOWEVER, WOULD---- SUCCESS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED-ANY EASIER-THE NEXT MORNING? EVIDENCE---- REGARDING THE CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE EFFECT SUGGESTS NOT.-------------------------------------------------------- SOLVING A PROBLEM BY---- RECALLING A RECENT SOLUTION BYPASSES-THE COGNITIVE EFFORT INVOLVED---- IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.-WHEN A TASK REQUIRES THAT THESE-----DECISIONS BE LEARNED, CONDITIONS SHOULD BE ARRANGED SUCH THAT---- THESE DECISIONS ARE PRACTICED. ARRANGING PRACTICE CONDITIONS---- THAT SERVE TO AVOID THIS COGNITIVE-EFFORT HINDERS THE LEARNING---- PROCESS.-------------------------------------------------------- LEARNING MOTOR SKILLS---- INVOLVES ALSO LEARNING COGNITIVE SKILLS. WE HAVE PROVIDED THREE---- INSTANCES OF RESEARCH THAT COLLECTIVELY SUGGEST THAT THE COGNITIVE---- EFFORT EXPECTED DURING PRACTICE HAS A CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE---- LEARNING PROCESS. THE FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE OF STUDENTS AND---- ATHLETES LIES IN THEIR ABILITY TO THINK AND ACT ON THEIR OWN.---- PROMOTING THAT PURPOSE IN PRACTICE AND TRAINING SESSIONS IS COMPATIBLE---- WITH THAT GOAL.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A CAVEAT----------------------- FOR INSTRUCTORS-------------------------------------------------------- AN INTERESTING---- QUESTION WAS RECENTLY POSED BY ROBERT BJORK:----- "IF THE RESEARCH---- PICTURE IS SO CLEAR, THEN WHY ARE MASSED PRACTICE, EXCESSIVE---- FEEDBACK, FIXED CONDITIONS OF TRAINING AND LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES---- FOR RETRIEVAL PRACTICE - AMONG OTHER NON-PRODUCTIVE MANIPULATIONS-------SUCH COMMON FEATURES OF REAL-WORLD TRAINING CONDITIONS?------.---- THERE ARE SEVERAL ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION. ONE COULD BE-THAT---- THE RESEARCH PICTURE IS NOT ALL THAT CLEAR. IN THIS PAPER WE---- HAVE BUILT AN ARGUMENT FOR THE ROLE OF COGNITIVE EFFORT IN LEARNING---- MOTOR SKILLS BASED ON A LIMITED SET OF DATA. THE GENERALIZABILITY---- OF THESE IDEAS AWAIT FURTHER RESEARCH.---------------------------------------------------------IF THE RESEARCH PICTURE---- IS ACCURATE HOWEVER, THEN BJORK ARGUES THAT NONPRODUCTIVE-TRAINING---- MANIPULATIONS CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR AS LEAST TWO FURTHER REASONS.---- ONE RELATES TO THE PERFORMANCE-/ LEARNING-DISTINCTION. SOME OF---- THE TEMPORARY BENEFITS TO PERFORMANCE S----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EEN BY THEIR TRAINING METHODS, OR PERHAPS THEY ARE NOT-AWARE---- OF THE IMPACT THEIR TRAINING REGIMES HAVE ON-LONGER TERM-RETENTION---- OR TRANSFER-AFTER THEIR-INVOLVEMENT WITH THE LEARNER HAS BEEN---- COMPLETED.-------------------------------------------------------- THE SECOND REASON GIVEN---- BY BJORK FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF NONPRODUCTIVE TRAINING CONDITIONS---- IS DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES OF-THE LEARNER. RAPID IMPROVEMENTS---- ON A MOTOR SKILL ARE REASSURING, AND THE LEARNER MAY DEVELOP---- ILLUSIONS ABOUT TIME PROGRESS MADE ON A SKILL AS A RESULT OF---- CONDITIONS OF PRACTICE THAT FAVOR RAPID, SHORT-TERM) BENEFITS.---- THESE INCORRECT SUBJECTIVE SOMETIMES ANECDOTAL ASSESSMENTS TEND---- SO FOSTER CONTINUED BELIEF IN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN CONTRAST,---- TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO PROMOTE COGNITIVE EFFORT---- DURING LEARNING MAY NOT BE GIVEN FULL VALUE BY THE SUBJECTIVE---- EXPERIENCES OF THE LEARNER BECAUSE OF THE DECELERATED RATES OF---- IMPROVEMENT THAT MAY OCCUR.-------------------------------------------------------- FOR THESE REASONS THE---- INSTRUCTOR IS FACED WITH ROLES OF BOTH ASSISTING THE LEARNER---- WITH THE SKILL TO BE LEARNED AND EDUCATING THE-LEARNER ABOUT---- LEARNING.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
