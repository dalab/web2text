------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPLITTING FILM----------------------------------  SINCE MANY FILM-TYPES WERE ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE FILM-MANUFACTURERS IN-35MM STOCK, SEVERAL SUBMINI CAMERA MANUFACTURERS DESIGNED FILM SPLITTERS-TO ALLOW CUTTING A SMALLER STRIP OF FILM FROM-35MM STOCK. WITH A FILM SLITTER,-YOU CAN GET SOME AMAZING FILM INTO YOUR SUBMINI, SUCH AS 2475 RECORDING FILM,-B----&W OR COLOR INFRARED FILM, TECH-PAN, AGFAPAN 25 AND EKTAR---------- SOMETIMES CALLED FILM SLITTERS -- AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH FILM-SPLICERS -- THESE DEVICES-CAME IN VARIOUS STYLES TO CUT DIFFERENT SIZE STRIPS.-SOME CUT A 35MM STRIP IN HALF TO PRODUCE TWO 17.5MM-STRIPS FOR CAMERAS THAT-USED THAT SIZE FILM. OTHERS WOULD CUT 16MM STRIPS, 9.5MM STRIPS AND EVEN-8MM STRIPS. SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT MADE THESE SLITTERS WERE GAMI, MINOLTA,-YASHICA, RICOH, MIKROMA, MICROTEC, ACMEL, AND VARITYPE. THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY-MORE. THEY BASICALLY WORK THE SAME WAY. USING RAZOR BLADES, OF SOME TYPE,-THEY CUT-OUT SMALLER STRIPS OF FILM FROM 35MM FILM. THESE ITEMS ARE NO LONGER-BEING MADE-AND ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND.---- IF YOU WANT A READY-MADE SLITTER, WE SUGGEST YOU CHECK OUT:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF YOU PREFER AN OLDER MODEL, CHECK-OUT THE------------------------------------SWAPMEET---- SECTION OF THE SUBCLUB.----------- IF YOU ARE HANDY OR DETERMINED, YOU MIGHT EVEN WANT TO BUILT YOUR OWN SLITTER.-ALL YOU NEED ARE A FEW SMALL PIECES OF WOOD, A COUPLE OF RAZOR BLADES, SOME-BASIC TOOLS, A LITTLE INGENUITY AND TIME.------ HERE ARE SOME PICTURES OF-A COMPLETED SPLITTER. WITH THIS SLITTER, YOU PLACE A BULK ROLL OF 35MM FILM-ON THE PART THAT LOOKS LIKE A BLACK HANDLE. THE FILM IS PRESSED DOWN ONTO-THE CUTTING BLOCK AND A REMOVEABLE PRESSURE PLATE IS SCREWED ON TOP. THEN-THE FILM IS PULLED THROUGH THE SLITTER AND ROLLED UP ON THE OTHER SIDE. TWO-PIECES OF FELT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FILM KEEP IT FROM GETTING SCRATCHED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- YOU CAN USE VARIOUS MATERIALS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR SLITTER.------ THE-DECISION ON MATERIAL IS-UP TO YOU.-------WOOD IS NORMALLY EASIER TO WORK-WITH IF YOU JUST HAVE STANDARD TOOLS, BUT OTHER MATERIALS MAY OFFER ADVANTAGES,-IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM AND HAVE THE NECESSARY TOOLS.------ IN BUILDING-YOUR OWN SLITTER, ONE BIG PROBLEM YOU WILL COME ACROSS IS THAT THE FILM IS-MEASURED IN MILLIMETERS, BUT AMERICAN BUILDING MATERIALS ARE NORMALLY CUT-IN INCHES. TO COMPLICATE MATTERS EVEN MORE, WHEN YOU ADD IN THE RAZOR BLADES-INBETWEEN THE WOOD BLOCKS, THE WIDTH IS INCREASED VERY SLIGHLY, BUT IT CAN-BE ENOUGH TO THROUGH OFF CAREFUL MEASUREMENTS. HERE ARE SOME HELPFUL-MEASUREMENTS:-------------------- 3/8" WOOD = .375 INCHES = 9.525MM -- A PIECE OF WOOD THIS THICK WILL NEED---- TO BE SANDED DOWN SOMEWHAT TO PRODUCE THE SIZE OF THE MINOX FILM (9.2MM).----------- 5/8" WOOD = .625 INCHES = 15.875MM -- A PIECE OF WOOD THIS THICK (PLUS THE---- ADDED THICKNESS OF THE RAZOR BLADE) SHOULD BE JUST RIGHT FOR 16MM FILM.----------- 11/16" WOOD = .6875 INCHES = 17.4625MM -- A PIECE OF WOOD THIS THICK (PLUS---- THE ADDED THICKNESS OF THE RAZOR BLADE) SHOULD BE JUST RIGHT FOR 17.5MM FILM.---------------/8" WOOD =--.375 INCHES = 34.925MM -- PIECES OF WOOD THAT TOTAL TO THIS---- THICKNESS (PLUS THE ADDED THICKNESSES OF THE RAZOR-BLADES) SHOULD BE JUST---- RIGHT FOR THE TOTAL WIDTH OF THE--5MM FILM. ------------------IF YOU NEED JUST A LITTLE EXTRA-SPACING, PIECES OF CONSTRUCTION PAPER WILL---- PROBABLY WORK FINE.------ IF YOU NEED A LITTLE LESS SPACING, SAND DOWN-THE---- WOOD WITH FINE SAND PAPER, MEASURING AS YOU GO.----------------  HERE ARE A FEW DIAGRAMS TO USE DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND SIZE OF FILM YOU-PLAN TO SLIT.------ THE DIAGRAMS ARE NOT TO SCALE.--------- IF YOU ARE USING----------------------------------- 35MM UNPERFORATED-FILM----.---- IF YOU ARE USING--------------------------------- STANDARD 35MM PERFORATED-FILM----.---- IF YOU ARE USING--------------------------------- 16MM FILM, REGARDLESS OF-THE PERFORATIONS----.--------- YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE DIAGRAMS IS THAT IF YOU ONLY USE ONE SIZE OF FILM-TO SLIT FROM (EX. 35MM)-AND ONE SIZE OF FILM TO SLIT TO (EX. 16MM) YOUR JOB-WILL BE EASIER.------ IF-YOU PLAN ON SLITTING FROM DIFFERENT FILM SIZES (EX.-35MM AND 16MM), OR SLIT TO DIFFERENT FILM SIZES (EX. 16MM AND-9.5MM) YOUR-WORK IS MORE INVOLVED.-------YOU WILL NEED-TO-MAKE DIFFERENT FILM SLITTERS-OR-MAKE A SLITTER-WITH DIFFERENT SLITTING BLOCK PIECES.-------IT'S UP TO-YOU TO DECIDE WHICH IS THE BEST ROUTE TO TAKE.--------------- BEFORE YOU GET STARTED, HERE ARE FEW POINTS TO PONDER.----------- MAKING A SLITTER TAKES TIME EVEN IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH HAND TOOLS.------ THE-MEASUREMENTS MUST BE PRECISE AND THE PIECES OF MATERIAL-ARE SMALL, MAKING-CUTTING-DIFFICULT.-------IT ALSO MAKES IT EASY TO CUT YOURSELF, SO WATCH-OUT----!
