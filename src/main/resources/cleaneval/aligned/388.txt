ALTITUDE BASICS,--------------------------------------------------------- 101 PERFORMING ALL FORMS OF OUTDOOR ACTIVITY BECOMES------- AN INCREASING CHALLENGE AS ALTITUDE INCREASES.- CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM AT HIGHER ALTITUDE IS TIED LESS TO YOUR PHYSICAL CONDITION, AND TIED MORE TO YOUR GENETIC STOCK.- CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CAN BE AGGRAVATED BY ALTITUDE.- IF YOU USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE AND DO SOME PREPARATION, YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM MOST OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES ALL THE-WAY TO 15,----FEET WITH LITTLE DISCOMFORT AND MEDICAL PROBLEMS.---------------------------------------------------- SEA LEVEL TO 3,500 FEET (1068 METRES)-------------- A VAST MAJORITY OF THE NORTH-AMERICAN POPULATION LIVES IN THIS ALTITUDE RANGE.- MOST PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR THOSE WITH EXTREME CARDIOPULMONARY DISORDERS CAN PERFORM ALMOST ANY ACTIVITY AT THIS LEVEL.- PEOPLE WHO LIVE AT SEA LEVEL WILL EXPERIENCE ALMOST NO NOTICEABLE ILL-EFFECTS WHEN-MOVING WITHIN THIS ALTITUDE RANGE WHERE THE AIR PRESSURE IS AROUND-------------------------------- 12 PSI------- (POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH).----------------------------------------------------,500 FEET TO 6,000 FEET (-830 METRES)--------------- MOST PEOPLE OF-ORDINARY HEALTH WILL HAVE LITTLE PROBLEMS AT THIS ALTITUDE.- PEOPLE WHO RESIDE IN AREAS THAT ARE BELOW 2,500 FEET MAY START TO NOTICE SOME BREATHING DIFFICULTY AS THEY MOVE ABOVE THE 5,000 FEET MARK.- PEOPLE WHO HAVE CARDIOPULMONARY DISORDERS- MAY HAVE SERIOUS-PROBLEMS IN THIS ALTITUDE RANGE AND SHOULD CONSULT A PHYSICIAN BEFORE VISITING OR ENGAGING IN OUTDOOR SPORTING ACTIVITY.--WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS AT THIS ALTITUDE DUE TO THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR OXYGEN THAT THE FETUS PUTS ON THEIR SYSTEMS.-------------------------------------------------- 6,000 FEET TO 10,000 FEET (3050 METRES)---------------- IN THIS ALTITUDE RANGE SOME PEOPLE MAY START TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS RELATED TO ALTITUDE.- AMS, OR ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS SYMPTOMS MAY SET IN AT ANY ALTITUDE ABOVE 6,000 FEET.- AT 10,000 FEET,-------------------------------- THE ATMOSPHERE IS ONLY 50% OF THAT FOUND AT SEA LEVEL-------.- BREATHING CAN BECOME DIFFICULT, EVEN FOR THOSE IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION.- WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND PEOPLE WITH CARDIOPULMONARY DISORDERS SHOULD CONSULT A PHYSICIAN BEFORE SPENDING ANY TIME AT THESE ALTITUDES.-------------------------------------------------- 10,000 FEET TO 14,000 FEET (4270 METRES)------------ ONCE YOU GET ABOVE 10,000 FEET THE OXYGEN CONTENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE HAS REACHED LEVELS THAT CAN BE DANGEROUSLY THIN. -NOT ONLY IS AMS A POSSIBILITY, BUT THE RISK OF HAPE OR HIGH ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA GREATLY INCREASES OVER 12,000 FEET.- TO PUT THIS IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE, PRIVATE PILOTS WHO FLY-OVER 10,000 FEET ARE REQUIRED TO USE SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN.- MOST PEOPLE THAT DO-MOUNTAINEERING WILL CLIMB IN THESE ALTITUDES.- PREGNANT WOMEN, CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWO, AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CARDIOPULMONARY DISORDERS SHOULD NOT GO ABOVE 10,000 FEET IN ALTITUDE.- SERIOUS MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS CAN OCCUR IN THIS RANGE.-------------------------------------------------- 14,000 FEET TO 18,000 FEET (5490 METRES)-------------- ABOVE 14,000 FEET, A PERSON ENTERS AN EXTREME ALTITUDE.- THE ATMOSPHERE CAN BE ONLY 40% OF THAT FOUND AT SEA LEVEL, AND AIR PRESSURE CAN DROP TO BELOW 10 PSI, CAUSING PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS ON THE BODY.- AMS, HAPE, AND HACE OR HIGH ALTITUDE CEREBRAL EDEMA CAN ALL BE EXPERIENCED IN THIS ALTITUDE RANGE.- TYPICALLY IN NORTH AMERICA, ONLY EXTREME MOUNTAINEERS WILL EXCEED THESE ALTITUDES FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME.- THIS ALTITUDE RANGE CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR ANY ONE, EVEN THOSE IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION.-------------------------------------------------- 18,000 FEET AND ABOVE-------------- ALTITUDE ABOVE 18,000 FEET IS ALSO CALLED,- THE DEATH ZONE.-- AS THE AIR PRESSURE FALLS TO AS LOW AS 7 PSI, THE BODY, EVEN WITH SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN LITERALLY STARTS TO DIE.- THE SEVERE ONSET OF HAPE AND HACE CAN OCCUR AT THESE ALTITUDES AND AMS SYMPTOMS ARE ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY EXPERIENCED.- ONLY HIGHLY EXPERIENCED MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD VENTURE INTO THESE ALTITUDES, AND A CONSTANT-VIGIL HAS TO BE MADE FOR HAPE AND HACE SYMPTOMS, WITH A FOCUS ON HACE SYMPTOMS AS PART OF THE SYMPTOMS FOR HACE IS CLOUDED JUDGMENT.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A CORNER OF PARADISE-------------------------------------------- WELCOME TO LE VILLAGE CATALAN-------.-------- WHETHER YOU PREFER AN ACTIVITY-HOLIDAY, NATURE AND CULTURE HOLIDAY, RELAXATION, SPA TREATMENT, OR A LANGUAGE COURSE, YOU WILL FIND OUR VILLAGE TO BE AN IDEAL BASE.------------------------------ GENERAL INFORMATION------------ LE VILLAGE CATALAN IS A SMALL VILLAGE OF 12 HOUSES IN THE MICROCLIMATIC FOOTHILLS OF SNOW-CAPPED CANIGOU IN THE PYRENEES, BETWEEN THE SKI RESORTS AND THE MEDITERRANEAN. IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE THE BEST CLIMATE IN FRANCE, WITH AN AVERAGE 300 DAYS OF SUNSHINE PER YEAR, AND IT IS RICH ON HISTORY, CULTURE AND NATURAL BEAUTY.-------------------------------------- IN THE PAST VERNET-LES-BAINS HAS BEEN THE FAVOURED HEALTH RESORT------- OF THE BRITISH ARISTOCRACY, WITNESSED BY THE EXTRAVAGANT ARCHITECTURE OF THE CASINO AND THE PARKS. EUROPE-S LARGEST WILDERNESS AREA, THE PYRENEES START JUST BEHIND THE VILLAGE, WITH EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEISURE ACTIVITIES, FROM HIKING THROUGH MOUNTAIN BIKING AND FISHING. A NEARBY WATERFALL HAS BEEN NAMED AFTER THE BRITISH - CASCADES DES ANGLAIS. FAMOUS CARCASSONNE, THE TAX FREE MINI STATE ANDORRA, SPAIN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES CAN BE REACHED ON DAY-TRIPS.----- OUR LITTLE VILLAGE IS SITUATED 5 MINUTES WALK FROM VERNET-LES-BAINS CENTRE, WITH ALL FACILITIES - SHOPS, RESTAURANTS AND CAFXS, A SPORTS CENTRE, CASINO, THERMAL SPA . LE VILLAGE CATALAN COMPRISES ONE, TWO AND THREE BEDROOM HOUSES ON TWO LEVELS, CONTAINING LOUNGE WITH WOODEN BEAMS AND FIREPLACE, KITCHEN, BATHROOM AND ALL ARE EQUIPPED WITH SIMPLE BUT ROBUST FURNISHING.----- THE ARCHITECTURE IS MEDIEVAL CATALAN, BUT BUILT AS RECENT AS 1965-1975 - IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO BUILD - AND PARTLY REFURBISHED IN------ 1998-EACH HOUSE IS DIFFERENT AND HALF THE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN GRANITE STONE. EACH HOUSE HAS A-PRIVATE, SUNNY TERRACE WITH SPECTACULAR,-UNOBSTRUCTIBLE VIEWS OF VERNET LES BAINS, THE VALLEYS AND THE MOUNTAINS. SIX OF THE HOUSES ALSO-HAVE A PRIVATE COURTYARD.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOME IN WILER, SWITZERLAND-------.----------------------------- RESORT DEVELOPMENT------------------------------------------- LIVING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 2000 METRES------- IN SWITZERLAND - SKIING AT UP TO---11 METRES.-WE ARE BUILDING EXCLUSIVE CHALETS AND APARTMENTS-RIGHT NEXT-TO-THE SKI SLOPE IN WILER, VALAIS (LXTSCHENTAL, 1 HOUR SOUTH OF BERNE)- WITH A UNIQUE-MOUNTAIN PANORAMA. YOU CAN LIVE THE CHALETS AND APARTMENTS ALL OVER THE YEAR.------------------------------------- WE ARE BUILDING EXCLUSIVE, COMFORTABLY FURNISHED CHALETS AND APARTMENTS------- ADJACENT TO THE CABLE CAR STATION AT 2000 METERS, WITH A CLEAR VIEW OF THE MOUNTAIN PANORAMA THAT IS GUARANTEED INTO THE FUTURE. THE SYMPATHETIC-ARCHITECTURE FITS-IN WITH THE TRADITIONAL HOUSING STRUCTURE OF THE-ALPINE PASTURE REGIONS AND MEETS INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF COMFORT. SCATTERED AROUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE FURTHER CHALETS AND MOUNTAIN RESTAURANTS. A NEW CLUBHOUSE WITH RESTAURANT AND BAR IS PLANNED.------------------------------------- FROM NOVEMBER------- 2003, A CABLE CAR RUNS UP TO 3111 METERS. A CHOICE-OF 4 TYPES OF CHALETS AND 6 TYPES OF APARTMENTS IS ANTICIPATED-(SEE ABOVE). CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY-BEGUN. THE FIRST SHOW-HOUSE IS NOW READY TO-BE VISITED-OR PURCHASED IMMEDIATELY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. E. BARTLETT PTY. LTD------------------------------------ PORTABLE ALTITUDE CHAMBER----------------------------------------------- ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS (AMS)----------- AS WE ASCEND ABOVE 2500 METRES (8000 FEET) OUR BODIES MUST ACCLIMATISE TO THE DECREASING AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AVAILABLE. FAILURE TO ACCLIMATISE CAN RESULT IN AMS.------------------------------------- THE SYMPTOMS OF AMS MAY INCLUDE ANY OF------- THE FOLLOWING: HEADACHE, FATIGUE, LOSS OF APPETITE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, COUGH, DIZZINESS, BLURRED-VISION, VOMITING, ETC. THE INTENSITY AND-SEVERITY OF THESE SYMPTOMS WILL VARY, BUT CAN VERY QUICKLY BECOME EXTREMELY SERIOUS AND EVEN FATAL.---- THE ONLY TREATMENT-FOR AMS IS-TO DESCEND TO A LOWER ALTITUDE.-----HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS WHERE IMMEDIATE DESCENT IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, DUE TO THE HAZARDS OF WEATHER, LACK OF MANPOWER, DIFFICULT TERRAIN OR GEOGRAPHY SUCH AS A PLATEAU.--------------------------------------------------- THE PRESSURE CHAMBER CONCEPT HAS------- BEEN AROUND FOR--0 YEARS OR-MORE, YET THE MAJORITY OF TREKKERS AND MOUNTAINEERS GOING TO HIGH ALTITUDES DO SO WITHOUT THIS ESSENTIAL PIECE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT. THE PAC IS AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT, AIMED AT TREKKING GROUPS, BOTH PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL, AS-WELL AS EXPEDITIONS TO HIGH ALTITUDE. IT IS AN ANSWER TO THE NEED FOR AN EFFECTIVE, SIMPLE, DURABLE, LIGHTWEIGHT AND AFFORDABLE PRESSURE CHAMBER FOR THE TREATMENT OF AMS.------------------------------------ EFFECTIVE----------- PAC TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN THE REVERSAL OF SYMPTOMS OF AMS. DEPENDING ON THE STARTING ALTITUDE, SIMULATED-DESCENTS OF-ABOUT 2000-METRES (6000 FEET) ARE ACHIEVED AT THE OPERATING PRESSURE OF 2 PSI ABOVE AMBIENT PRESSURE.-------------------------------------- SIMPLE----------- THE PAC HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO BE AS- SIMPLE TO OPERATE AS POSSIBLE. ONE OPERATOR CAN PERFORM A COMPLETE TREATMENT CYCLE ON THEIR OWN. A SUMMARY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS FOUND IN THE OPERATOR'S MANUAL ARE PRINTED ON THE PAC ITSELF, WHILE ALL THE VALVES ARE CLEARLY LABELLED TO AVOID CONFUSION.-------------------------------------- LIGHT----------- THE PAC, ALL UP WITH PUMP, HOSE, MANUAL REPAIR KIT AND STORAGE BAG WEIGHS IN AT LESS THAN 8 KGS.----- PAC TECHNOLOGY BUYS TIME AND CAN STABILISE OR REVERSE SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF AMS BEFORE (OR WHILE) DESCENT IS UNDERTAKEN.------------------------------ TREKSAFE----------- AUSTRALIA------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ NUTRITION OF THE SPORTSMAN---- THE OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS OF THE PERFORMANCE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "THE FATTY-ACIDS POLYINSATURXS: ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTH--------------- ".--------------------------------------------- INFLUENCE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND HYPOXIA ON BLOOD FLUIDITY:-------------------------------------------- [ BLOOD THICKNESS IS INVERSELY DEPENDENT UPON THE MEMBRANE RIGIDITY OF THE BLOOD CELLS, WHICH IS CONVERSELY DEPENDENT ON THE RIGIDITY OF DOUBLE-LAYERED LIPIDIC OF THE MEMBRANE OF THE RED GLOBULE. A RISE IN SATURATED FATTY ACID CONNECTIONS LOWERS THE NUMBER OF NON-SATURATED DOUBLE CONNECTIONS AND CONTRIBUTES TO CELL RIGIDITY.------------------------------------------] [ ENDURANCE EXERCISES INCREASES-THE RIGIDITY OF THE RED BLOOD CELLS, PROVIDING AN INCREASE IN THE THICKNESS OF THE BLOOD. HYPOXIA (LOWERED OXYGEN VOLUME) OF ALTITUDE REDUCES PLASMIC VOLUME AND INDUCES A REDUCTION IN THE THICKNESS OF THE BLOOD.------------------------------------------] [ INCREASES IN DURATION AND INTENSITY OF EXERCISE TOGETHER WITH INCREASES IN ALTITUDE, INCREASES SATURATED FATTY ACID PRESENCE AND DECREASES POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS -- ACID ARACHIDONIC (OMEGA-6), EPA AND DHA (OMEGA-3). THIS INCREASES-MEMBRANE SATURATION WITH THE AMOUNT OF OMEGA-6 AND OMEGA-3 CORRELATING-WITH AN INCREASE IN RED BLOOD CELL MEMBRANE-RIGIDITY. (SIMILAR IN INFLUENCE TO AN INCREASE IN CHOLESTEROL PRESENCE) AND REDUCING THE BLOOD CAPACITY TO ABSORB-AND RETAIN-OXYGEN.------------------------------------------] [ DURING PROLONGED EXERCISE,-AND AT HIGHER ALTITUDES, BLOOD CELL CHANGES PRODUCE REDUCED CAPILLARY EFFICIENCY, PARTICULARLY IN THE LUNGS, LIVER, AND SPLEEN AND REDUCED ABILITY TO CARRY AND TRANSFER OXYGEN TO PERIPHERAL TISSUES. THIS INDUCES AN ANAEMIA OF IRON DEFICIENCY BY RUPTURE OF THE RED BLOOD CELLS IN THE CAPILLARIES, UNDER THE EFFECT OF THE RISE IN THE CARDIAC FLOW AND THE BLOOD PRESSURE.----------------------------------------------------------- ] INFLUENCE OF FISH OIL ABSORPTION ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE--------------------------------------------------- [ SUPPLEMENTATION OF DIET WITH FISH OIL (OMEGA-3 = TUNA, SALMON, SARDINES, MACKEREL, LAKE TROUT, WALNUTS, PECANS, ALMONDS) SUPPRESSES THE HARMFUL BLOOD FLUIDITY CHANGES ENCOURAGED BY ENDURANCE EXERCISES AND HIGH ALTITUDES.--------------------------------------------------] [ FISH OILS REDUCE CAPILLARY RESISTANCE TO OXYGEN UPTAKE AND INCREASE BLOOD CIRCULATION TO PERIPHERAL AREAS. THE EFFICIENCY OF OXYGEN TRANSFER FROM BLOOD TO MUSCLE CELLS IS ENHANCED BY A REDUCTION IN TISSUE RIGIDITY AND-AN INCREASE IN RED BLOOD CELL PRESENCE-AT THE CAPILLARIES.------------------------------------------] [ AT HIGHER ALTITUDES AND DURING ENDURANCE EXERCISES, FISH OILS INCREASE THE OXYGEN DESATURATION OF THE HAEMOGLOBIN, AND, INCREASES THE BLOOD CONCENTRATION OF LACTIC ACID ... THE CONSEQUENCE OF METABOLISM OF GLUCOSE (STORED ENERGY IN CELLULAR SUGARS). ALSO, ADRENALIN RECEPTORS ON THE CELLULAR SURFACES ARE SENSITISED BY THE ADDITION OF OMEGA-3 ( = TUNA, SALMON, SARDINES, MACKEREL, LAKE TROUT, WALNUTS, PECANS, ALMONDS) FISH OILS MAKING GLUCOSE METABOLISM EASIER AND FASTER.-----------------------------------------------------------] PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES------------------------------------------- [ FOR ALTITUDES OVER 2000 M AND FOR HIGH ENDURANCE ACTIVITIES, A SUPPLEMENTATION OF 250 G OF OMEGA-3 FISH OILS 3 TO 5 TIMES PER WEEK ( = TUNA, SALMON, SARDINES, MACKEREL, LAKE TROUT, WALNUTS, PECANS, ALMONDS) IS BENEFICIAL. TO AVOID A VITAMIN E DEFICIENCY FROM ARISING FROM THE EXERCISE AND THE ADDITIONAL POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS, A SUPPLEMENTATION WITH VITAMIN E IS REQUIRED. THESE CHANGES WILL PROVIDE FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------] COMMENT------------------ RELEASE OF MERCURY FROM CELLULAR BINDING CAN BE ENHANCED BY REMAINING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1800 TO 2000 METRES (5,800 TO 6,400 FEET) FOR A PERIOD OF NOT LESS THAN 1 WEEK WITH AN EARLY DAILY FLUCTUATION BY TRAVEL DOWN TO 0 TO---- METRES AND RETURN WITHIN---TO 6 HOURS. THE EARLY FLUCTUATIONS ENCOURAGE GREATER PERMEABILITY OF THE CELL WALL FOR THE RELEASE OF MERCURY AND OTHER TOXINS.
