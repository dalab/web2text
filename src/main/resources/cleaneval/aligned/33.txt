The point is, I knew the minute that Shmi
talked about the circumstances of Anakin's birth that he was
□□□□□□planned,□□□□□□ and that meant to me that it was meant for him to
eventually become Darth Vader. I mean, D'uh!□□□□□□□□□□□□□
SINCE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Ask George Lucas this: □□□□□□George, did you mean for Anakin to become
Darth Vader, and that the Sith were involved in his creation? Did you
intend for Palpatine, who becomes Emperor, to be the driving force (by
way of what he learned from his own master) behind the creation of
Anakin/Vader?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Let me guess . . . the answer would be . . . □□□□□□YES.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Okay, I've been hanging around here for a couple of months, as well as anxiously awaiting this movie to see if the series can be redeemed. □I've finally decided to break my silence and speak up and call □□□□□□bullshit□□□□□□ on this.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There's no □□□□□□well 'duh!□□□□□□ moment, Jim. □You may have assumed that GL was going to head that way with the story, but you never knew, and neither did we. □Technically, with what we've been told in this thread about ROTS, we can still only make an assumption. □You have no call talking down to someone about a couple lines in TPM because the only thing those lines imply is immaculate conception.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
As far as your ask GL question, it's irrelevant to the subject. □The subject is whether or not one can infer from Episodes 1 and 2 if Anakin was definitely created via Palpatine. □And the answer is □□□□□□no.□□□□□□□□One can certainly hypothesize this - hell, the morons over at TheForce.net have been arguing this possibility for years. □But even the rapid fanboy repeat viewer can't extrapolate your assumptions about the storyline from the material presented in Episodes 1 and 2. □All you can do is guess at the possibilities until the text gives you an answer.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
For what it's worth, I also appreciate this plot turn - it rings truer to the machinations of Palpatine than the will of microscopic life forms.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Bailey□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□jabba there's a difference between guessing that plot revelation and
it having been previously cemented in the text. □ there was all kinds of
speculation as to the nature of the immaculate conception, but there
was nothing in episodes 1 or 2 that indicated palpatine had to be
behind it.  I mean, you might as well reason since he talks so much
about □□□□□□planning□□□□□□ and □□□□□□forseeing□□□□□□ that he was behind lando losing the

unimaginative and mind-bogglingly unoriginal plot contrivances in
movie history. Lucas came up with THAT in 20 years?!□□□□□□□□□□□□□
But I digress, can anyone give me a good rating of the lightsaber
duels? Is it really just a case of quantity over quality, or were you
just expecting a bit too much? There are supposed to be 5 duels in
this film, but they've barely warranted a mention so far. Are they
really that bad?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jim Pappas/Jabba□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Yeah, call bullshit. I am sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. I cannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. I fucking saw it coming, and I have discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. I can't help it that this is so.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Charlie Brigden□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Did Palpatine name me Sean too?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□devincf□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I think the duels are fairly lifeless most of the time, and The Duel is a major disappointment.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
BTW, I think it's interesting that people here are saying my take is
negative. I am definitely more positive than negative on the film, and
my review at rottentomatoes will be fresh rated. But Episode III is a
pretty mediocre movie, and it fizzles more than it sizzles - and
frankly, Episode III needed to be the one to hit it out of the
ballpark. As a generic action film it's OK, as the most important
episode of the PT it's a bummer.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□gravedigger□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about Palpatine being Anakin's old man.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Waker□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

film, besides of course your several posts happily bashing it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And Fatboy is a douche, if only because he goes over the top about
everything he ever writes about or discusses, and has no
self-awareness; he's wound up leaving, dramatically, every board on
the internet, and critiquing them at length on the next board he
wanders to. But that doesn't necessarily invalidate his points.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Samurai Mike□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The back and forth plotting between Palpatine and the Jedi Council
(each is trying to use Anakin against the other) would be GREAT if it
happened in more than two back to back scenes. That should have been
the main plot of the movie, with Anakin increasingly □torn.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□cognizant□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Noob question: □Why would Palpatine 'create' someone powerful enough to beat him? □He looked pretty comfortable using Maul, Dooku, etc, aways staying on top.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□devincf□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

We could stretch it and hypothesize that Palpatine's masterplan was to
create and then ensure the Skywalker line would continue and he would
use each member like lapdogs for his nefarious schemes (because he's a
lazy bastard or something), first Anakin, then his son Luke, and so on
forever, but this plan (ludicrous as it sounds) is shot to shit from
the beginning because of Anakin's duel with Obi 1 which leaves him
more machine than man.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

he though no apprentice would ever try to overthrow him, even with the
Sith's history. Maybe he saw himself as the ultimate Sith Lord, and
after Vader decided he wouldn't need any more to do his bidding, but
didn't think what had gone on in the past with Sith overthrowing Sith
would ever happen to him.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I always saw Vader as a kind of advisor. Tarkin was the main military
commander, and Vader was always just there in the background to
represent the Emperor.

That's the problem with foreseeing things. Unlike Jim, most seers
can't actually see how everything is going to work out. Palpatine
could control Vader easily -- that's the great thing about
conditioning someone with hate and loss.

Vader was supposed to kill Yoda and Kenobi. With their deaths, Padme
and the kids might not have lived, or the children could have been
raised as Sith. (Like Jordan, Minnesota for dark jedi.) If Vader
hadn't failed to kill those two jedi, none of the OT would happen, and
Palpatine and Vader would still be steering the ship.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Hmmm.□ I used to like Fatboy.

What did you think of Eps 1 and 2 when you first saw them? I ask because a lot of people (like me) liked them first up, then saw through the eye candy soon after. I guess I'm asking you if you think you're current opinion on Ep 3 will change?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I don't know quite what to make of the opinions here. Most of the reviewers seem to be more interested in pointing out whats wrong with it, then saying □□□□□□but I think overall I like it□□□□□□.

I strongly disliked both EPs 1 and 2 right out of the gate...but in
different ways.  My hatred of EP1 was very confusing because I had been
such a die-hard STAR WARS fan for so many years.  It took me a while to
fully reconcile my disappointment.  I had no such hesitation with EP2.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EP3 is a different animal.  The more I think about it, the more
questions I end up asking.  Unfortunately, I'm not finding satisfying
answers.  But still, I consider it a significant improvement over EPs 1
and 2, and for that, I remain somewhat grateful that at least one of
the Prequels wasn't a total failure.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Canned Food□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Although I haven't seen the movie yet, I noticed some of you guys were

It's interesting to see how the future shifts dramatically throughout
episode III, causing people to wonder how things could have been if
they had not transpired as they did in the film:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Anakin and Padme were gonna retire to Naboo after their secret got out
and both were expelled from their homes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Then, Anakin converted to the Sith, and things were going to be that
the Jedi would be extinguished, Palpatine would be killed by
Anakin/Vader, and Padme would sit as his side as the new Imperial
family in the galaxy. Kinda neat to imagine how their kids would have
been like had they been raised as Sith.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Andre Dellamorte□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

You want honesty? I really liked TPM when it came out. There were
reasons for this:□□□□□□□□□
I was young and naive.□□□□□□□□.
I was not the jaded moviegoer I am today.□□□□□□□□.
Most importantly, I had never been near an internet messageboard in
my life.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Over the years I came to see it for the soulless toy commercial it is,
but for a while there I DID like it, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
AOTC I liked the first time, got caught up in it, cheered when Yoda
got his groove on. However, by the second showing I was over it, too
many crap scenes to forgive, and it seemed the characters had
regressed (Obi-wan and Padme, I'm looking at YOU). I haven't watched
it at all since its theatrical run (except for a crappy vcd copy I
borrowed from a friend that had hilarious subtitles. □□□□□□The Jedi will be

I don't think I was guessing. It was my take on things once Shmi
started talking about the circumstances of Anakin's birth. I mean, it
wasn't just coincidence that Qui Gon ended up on Tatooine, it wasn't
just coincidence that he met Anakin there. It was part of Palpatine's
plan, or that is what I thought. That was how I took it at the time.
After all, doesn't Yoda say later to □□□□□□not underestimate the powers of
the Emperor?□□□□□□ I took that line from Ep. 6 and applied that logically
to what happens in the PT. I was wrong about one thing I considered,
that Qui Gon was secretly a Sith, so I'm not that good of a guesser.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jim Pappas/Jabba□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Actually, I have to agree with Fischer on this one. □While I prefer the Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved under your fingernails. □I happen to be a fingernail guy, because I like my nuts.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is □□□□□□the one□□□□□□ it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth. It could also be considered that the midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. I know I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars cartoons, or the live action series he's planning.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□gl2899□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□SPOILERS□□□□□□□□□□□□□
This film has a higher number of laugh out loud moments than the other
two. Sadly, they are all in the more intense and emotional scenes.
Lucas seems to be emotionally tone deaf.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The movie ended up being what I expected: reasonable eye candy with a
groaner of a story. It's full of fairly ridiculous stuff:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The Emperor is a joke (although Palpatine at the opera/ballet is
great)□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Lucas should have stopped having old men fight□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Mace vs Sidious is one of the worst fight scenes ever□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The Duel is a huge disappointment. It's actually sort of boring and
has none of the emotional heaviness of the one at the end of JEDI.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The opening rescue sequence is like the Jedi Knight Follies□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Lucas insists on crowding his frame in every fight scene. There's no
emotional component to any of this stuff.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Padme's death is frankly ludicrous□□□□□□□□□□□□□
So is Vader as Frankenstein□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Vader cries. Twice.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
General Grievous is a villain who belongs in a spoof. At one point he
wrings his hands because i guess he has no mustache to twirl□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There is some good stuff:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
McGregor, once the movie picks up steam□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There are a couple of choice shots, including SPOILER the one where
Vader goes to kill the younglings END SPOILER□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Either the effects shots are much better this time than AOTC or I'm
just really used to digital stunt men.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Well, sounds like they stuck to the [bleep]ing script.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Padme dies of a [bleep]ing broken heart?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Anakin is more whiny psycho than galactic badass?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
General Grievous is Snidely Whiplash in a tin suit?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Yeah, the people that said that the leaked script wasn't indicative of
what was to come were wrong.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Thats as believable as Anakin as Christ.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Shouldn't have bought into the hype.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Shame on my thrice.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I hope some people can enjoy it though. My nephew is going to love it.
Seeing him enjoy this movie will be worth it to me. But I am just not
the target audience for Star Wars anymore.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

It could also be considered that the midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. I know I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars cartoons, or the live action series he's planning.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
or maybe lucas just didn't know exactly how it was going to play out
either-- and during the course of writing it he painted himself into
some corners that were resolved less than satisfactorily.  it happens
in single screenplays all the time, let alone a story that takes place
over six.  that wouldn't be the worst of the PT's faults. □ whether
palpatine helped to conceive anakin or not, it's still contrived.  I
don't see why palpatine helping would make it less so, as it just adds
another level to it (and takes more of the human element out of
anakin's failure not to mention further complicates the □□□□□□prophecy□□□□□□.)□□ I
think if it's only a single line in the movie then fatboy's
interpretation is still a possibility, at least for those of us who
may want to willfully ignore the added twist.  I don't mind ambiguity-
but to detail the whole midichlorian\immaculate conception\prophecy
thing and still leave it ambiguous seems really dumb.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jim Pappas/Jabba□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□GL knew exactly how it was going to play out. He's had this whole vision in his head for many years.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Also, I think maybe many of us are taking all of this way too seriously. Star Wars is a movie series, that is all that it is. It is popular entertainment, not something that is going to get food into the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet. We need to maintain perspective here.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Timmay□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is □□□□□□the one□□□□□□ it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
But it wasn't Luke that killed the emperor, it was Anakin, hence
destoying the Dark Side and such.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I just had to chime in at least once on this.  Personally, I tried to
not get too excited about this last episode, but as a 27 year old with
older brothers who grew up with Star Wars toys all around me and
having Return of the Jedi as my seminal movie event of my childhood
it's impossible. □We're supposed to see Anakin turn into Darth freaking Vader here! □You can't blow that, you can't.....you can't.....□□□□□□□□□□□□□
But I digress, back to the discussion......□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Russ Fischer□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□We're supposed to see Anakin turn into Darth freaking Vader here! □You can't blow that, you can't.....you can't.....□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I think the last thing I say on this entire topic has to be:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Noooooooooooooooooo!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The Sphinx□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□So, does Palpatine or Dooku (or anybody else for that matter) take

into the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet.Actually,
from a certain point of view, it does. Lucas has held special
screenings for each of the prequels and donates all the proceeds to
various charities.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□theslik1□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The thing that's most surprising to me is that no one is really
spending much time talking about The Duel. THIS is the moment we've
been waiting for since the end of the second act of SW:ANH. We meet
again, at last. The circle is now complete; when I left you, I was but
the learner, now I am the master.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And now the people who've watched The Duel aren't even mentioning it
as one of the high points of the film, as particularly emotional or
even memorable. That's a horrible sign.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The first horrible sign, of course, was the opening crawl for TPM. In retrospect, that told us everything we needed to know about the cynical, self-indulgent pointlessness of the entire PT. ROTS is simply the natural culmination of a collosal waste of film-making resources and the ultimate □□□□□□fuck you□□□□□□ from Lucas, who seemed determined from the start to force feed his extremely beige vision of Star Wars to the masses. It's really pretty simple...Lucas had the pick of many excellent story ideas and every conceivable technical resource at his disposal to ensure thoughtful, well crafted movies. Those factors alone make the final product inexcusable...beautiful high-tech bilgewater, deliberately and defiantly thrust in our faces by a man who was sure we'd pay for it no matter what. He was right, twice. And he'll be right again this time.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It would be interesting to see how this would've all played out if ROTS actually were a first rate film. The disconnect between it and the first two prequels would be too jarring I think, and that would've definitively cast the Prequel Trilogy as a failure (regardless of the box office). It makes you wonder if George had to □□□□□□Lucasize□□□□□□ parts of the movie...including The Duel...to ensure that the tone of mediocrity remained at least somewhat uniform from film to film. But enough of my paranoia...□□□□□□□□□□□□□
My rant isn't a slam at the fans. I know what it's like to be a fan, and as a fan it's very disappointing to think of what could have been with the right story and the right director.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□mastronikolas□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□How long till the extremely vocal bashers manage to convince people

ROTS had Palpatine telling Anakin flat out that he created him
himself. Now does the fact that Lucas took it out mean he threw out
the idea completely to go with the immaculate conception/Chosen One
idea, or did he just not want to spell out Palpatine's hand in
Anakin's creation and leave it up to the audience to make the
connection?

And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along? That is just so wrong.

Perhaps the stupidity bit was your take when reading it from Devin's
post□□□□□□□□□□□□□
You dont even have to read it. You should just know.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Yeah, call bullshit. I am sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. I cannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. I fucking saw it coming, and I have discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. I can't help it that this is so.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Dude, shut up. Go to TheForce.net or something.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

From what I've seen from both fansites and official materials, like
Bouzereau's Annotated Screenplays, the □□□□□□□overall storyline□□□□□□ has changed
so much over the years that the final version is virtually
unrecognizable from the original conception.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Answer me this: Why is it essential for fans to maintain the myth that
Lucas planned everything out in advance  back in 1974?  Film, unlike
books, is a medium based on contingency.  Stuff is always going to be
going □in and□ out of a movie based on the availability of performers,
the amount of money involved, and totally random events.  On top of
that, some ideas just become unworkable or silly or just plain bad
over time.  I'm sure that Lucas had a much bigger role planned for Jar
Jar over the course of  the prequels, but minimized his presence when
it became apparent that everyone --EVERYONE!-- hated the shit out  of
the character, and not just rabid fanboys and movie critics.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There's no shame in enjoying an epic saga, even if the author was just
making it up as he or she went along.  What matters is that the author
maintains a certain level of quality and consistency over the course
of the story-- i.e., □□□□□□as long as it's good.□□□□□□□ Insisting on a single
unifying vision, especially as it pertains to characters like Boba
Fett, Maul, and Grevious --all more the products of toy licensing
conferences than some grand Joseph Campbell mythopoeic crap-- suggests
an inability to enjoy the movies for what they are.  Or maybe you
aren't enjoying them all that much to begin with?  Search your
feelings, you know this to be true...
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Besides, as everyone knows by now, Lucas swiped the plot and
characters from Jack Kirby's New Gods comics and the Kinks' Part 1
Lola Versus Powerman and the Money-Go-Round.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□You have to give props to Lucas, he is the greatest spin doctor and marketing genius of all time.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Absolutely 100% correct.  (Well, aside from certain dictators
throughout history.)□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I guess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago, he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films, then 9 films again, then 6 films. □And yet he did. □He said in interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives JEDI. □So much for that story.□ It wasn't until 1996 that Lucas first
publicly stated that the whole Saga would be comprised of only six
films, nearly 20 years after the first film hit screens and became a
global pop culture phenomenon (contrary to apologists trying to
downplay the impact of STAR WARS in order to make the lackluster
Prequels look better in comparison.)□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I don't believe a damn thing Lucas or his cronies say anymore.  I can
only look at his work and judge it on its own merits.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Great post, Louie!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jim Pappas/Jabba□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I can't understand how any of you believe that George Lucas □□□□□□made up□□□□□□□the plots of the PT as he went along.

Actually, I could swear that I just read an interview in which Lucas
said that most of the prequel trilogy was □□□□□□filler,□□□□□□ and that Ep. III
was the real □□□□□□meat□□□□□□ of the PT.□ In other words, most of the events in
Eps. I and II were just a means of killing time before Anakin's
fateful lava slalom.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Believe what you want.  I think Lucas had the idea of doing a big outer
space adventure in his head □back □in the□ '70s, but that was about as
specific as it got.  He narrowed down his focus by reading SF novels
and Marvel Comics, and possibly Joseph Campbell as well, but probably
more Castaneda. □I□ suspect the theme of kids redeeming the  father
probably didn't  occur to him until well □in the□ pre-production of
Empire, and I  seriously doubt  Leia was even going  to be a blood
relation until sometime between Empire and Jedi, regardless of  the
rumors about Fisher wanting a bigger role.  In short, most of the
transcendent themes were things  Lucas came up with after 1977 and
applied retroactively to  the saga through the magic of filmmaking and
the gullibility of fans who couldn't accept that he'd improvised most
of the storyline.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central □character of the entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and is never seen or mentioned again.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Miasta□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central □character of the entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and is never seen or mentioned again.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Wouldn't it be cool if Lucas let some ILM underlings or intern types at Lucas film, who have been waiting in the wings, getting coffee and stuff for the senior artist for years, have a go at doing an animated version of the first draft of Star Wars just for a goof? □Well, woudn't it? □No? □Fine! □I'd buy it, or watch it on The Cartoon Network! □Cary on...□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Leto II□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I often wonder how much of that was Lucas and how much of it was Gary Kurtz. □I'm not sure to what extent Kurtz was involved creatively (though his absence is felt in ROTJ), but I always got the feeling that he saw the SW saga as more of a grand tragic epic with a decades-long story arc than Lucas' fairy tale in space conception. □In one interview, I recall Kurtz saying that only Leia would survive and she would end up in Episode XII as the □□□□□□People's Quen□□□□□□ after the Emperor had been deposed. □Darth Vader was always going to die in Episode VI (and possibly Luke with him), but the Empire would exist for some time after, albeit in a reduced form. □The prequel trilogy would be largely disconnected from the other movies, with the first film set generations before the rest of the story, dealing with the foundation of the Jedi Order. □□But there's no real evidence to substantiate any of these claims, and Kurtz was probably just drawing on conversations he'd had with Lucas back in the '70s.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
To wit, from Cinescape Online, circa the summer of 1999:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Kurtz Reveals 'SW 1-9' Plot□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Gary Kurtz, the producer of the original versions of Star Wars: A New
Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, spoke at a Sci-Fi Expo convention
audience in Plano, Texas yesterday. After reportedly offering up a
mixed review of The Phantom Menace, Kurtz shared the original plans
for all nine episodes of the Star Wars saga circa 1980, according to
TheForce.net. When Lucas changed course with Return of the Jedi, Kurtz
opted to leave the Star Wars saga and produce The Dark Crystal with
Jim Henson. What follows is the fan site's description of what Kurtz
allegedly relayed (no doubt to a room full of stunned Star Wars fans),
and a very cool glimpse into what might have been:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 1: Was to focus on the origins of□□□□□□□□□□□
the Jedi Knights and how they are initiated and□□□□□□□□□□□□trained.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 2: Introduction and development of□□□□□□□□□□□
Obi-Wan Kenobi.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 3: Introduction and life of Vader.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 4: There were seven different drafts□□□□□□□□□□□
of the film. At one point, they pursued buying□□□□□□□□□□□
the rights to Hidden Fortress because of the□□□□□□□□□□□
strong similarities. At one point, Luke was a□□□□□□□□□□□
female, Han was Luke's brother, Luke's father□□□□□□□□□□□
was the one in prison (interesting point for□□□□□□□□□□□
some debates) and the film featured 40□□□□□□□□□□□□wookies.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 5: Once written, the screenplay of□□□□□□□□□□□
Empire is almost exactly what is seen on□□□□□□□□□□□
screen. The only cut scenes were those□□□□□□□□□□□
involving wampas in the rebel base (cut□□□□□□□□□□□
because of time and unsolved technical□□□□□□□□□□□
glitches) and about two minutes of Luke/Yoda□□□□□□□□□□□
Jedi training with no real dialog.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 6: Leia was to be elected □□□□□□Queen of□□□□□□□□□□□
her people□□□□□□ leaving her isolated. Han was to□□□□□□□□□□□
die. Luke confronted Vader and went on with□□□□□□□□□□□
his life alone. Leia was not to be Luke's sister.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 7: Third trilogy was to focus on□□□□□□□□□□□
Luke's life as a Jedi, with very few details□□□□□□□□□□□□planned out.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 8: Luke's sister (not Leia) appears□□□□□□□□□□□
from another part of the galaxy.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
EPISODE 9: First appearance of the Emperor.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And then there's this passage in the 1980 work Once Upon A Galaxy: A
Journal of The Making of Empire Strikes Back, by Alan Arnold (pp.
247-48):
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Alan Arnold: Tell me more about the overall concept of the Star Wars
saga.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
George Lucas: There are essentially nine films in a series of three
trilogies.The first trilogy is about the young Ben Kenobi and the
early life of Luke's father when Luke was a little boy. This trilogy
takes place some twenty years before the second trilogy, which
includes Star Wars and Empire. About a year or two passes between each
story of the trilogy and about twenty years pass between the
trilogies. The entire saga spans about fifty-five years.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
AA: How much is written?
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
GL: I have story treatments on all nine. I also have voluminous notes,
histories, and other material I've developed for various purposes.
Some of it will be used, some not. Originally, when I wrote Star Wars,
it developed into an epic on the scale of War and Peace, so big I
couldn't possibly make it into a movie. So I cut it in half, but it
was still too big, so I cut each half into three parts. I then had
material for six movies. After the success of Star Wars I added
another trilogy, but stopped there, primarily because reality took
over. After all, it takes three years to prepare and make a Star Wars
picture. How many years are left? So I'm still left with three
trilogies of nine films. At two hours each, that's about eighteen
hours of film!□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Straight from the equine's embouchement. Plus there're other Nine-Film LucasQuotes in other sources, like his Splinter of the Mind's Eye foreword.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Ahoatam□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
For all his film interestsnot just the companies but the extension of
Raiders' Indiana Jones character into two more features and a TV
serieshe was, and remains, a doting, full-time dad. But he had a
neglected child, the Star Wars saga, that needed his help in growing
up. Lucas began writing the new trilogy, starting with Phantom Menace,
in 1994.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Furthermore, Lucas says in the commentary of ANH DVD that he wrote a
backstory for each character, and that fed into what eventually made
the prequel story.  He didn't have 6 or 9 ready-to-go screenplays, as
is the popular belief.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I, too, subscribe to the paint-himself-in-corner viewpoint.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Amphibatron□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along? That is just so wrong. GL has had the entire story as an idea in his mind, since day one. He has said this himself many times, and he is meticulous and does nothing without much planning and foresight. I suggest you do a little research.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you look at early pre-production artwork of episode 1 you will see that Qui-Gon is nowhere to be seen. Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to himself. □Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku? Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department to design a droid general. □Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of ROTJ because the darkside □had slowly degraded his appearance. He obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels: Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest has been made up as he went along. I mean he said himself in a recent interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority of the back story Lucas originally planned out.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Ahoatam□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□05-07-2005, 05:11 PM□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Back on topic:□□□□□□□□□□□□□

It's something Obi-Wan says just before he leaves Anakin at the
shipyards on Coruscant.  I can't seem to find it in my copy of the
script. □Anyone?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Bailey□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□when obi wan and anakin part ways after the opening battle, obi wan makes reference to anakin having to be the □□□□□□poster boy.□□□□□□□ when they separate for the □□□□□□last□□□□□□ time there's not really anything modern (wild bantha chase is the closest thing.)□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□when obi wan and anakin part ways after the opening battle, obi wan makes reference to anakin having to be the □□□□□□poster boy.□□□□□□□ when they separate for the □□□□□□last□□□□□□ time there's not really anything modern (wild bantha chase is the closest thing.)□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

Someone actually wrote a fan script of A Princess of Ondos, the
proposed second installment of The Adventures of The Starkiller,
mentioned in passing at the end of Lucas' first draft of Star Wars:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Eschatos□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I think you're saying that Kenobi should have been the central
character of the PT. I couldn't agree more.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
That's exactly what I was saying. (I was more focused on why
Anakin/Vader should have been a supporting character in that post, so
I understand the cautiousness of your post.) If you think about it,
actually, the films could be much more solid as they if they were
edited to focus more on Kenobi and less on Skywalker. The whole
problem with the PT is that Lucas, even during Ep. I, was too
concerned with giving Anakin significant screen coverage. Most of
Anakin's involvment in I and II are just subplots on steroids anyway
...
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Also, if they had gone that route, it would have made for a stronger
saga. The PT could have been the story of the benevolent father
failing to deliver his son from a path of evil and the OT would have
been the negative of that: the benevolent son delivers the father from
that path.  The ramifications just cascade from there ... especially
when you consider the tension it would have given the Yoda and Sidious
relationship by making them the mentors of the central figures in the
story: the patriarchs.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□LightningLouie□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Straight from the equine's embouchement.

Technically, the Empire was pretty topical for the Cold War period.
Also, considering the sequels were released in the post-Vietnam era,
the Emperor has always been topical (Lucas has stated many times that
Sidious is a fictional version of Nixon).□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□LightningLouie□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Back on topic:□□□□□□□□□□□□□

How much of this carried over into the final film, and how much of it do you think audiences will pick up on? □In the somewhat divided political state the US is in now, does Lucas risk alienating a portion of his fan base by comparing the President to the Emporer? □Comments from those who have seen the film, please.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's nothing new from Lucas; the political subtext was there from the
beginning, though it got submerged as the movies went on.  The Emperor
was conceived of as a Nixon figure, a crafty politico turned paranoid
and inaccessible, and there was always the idea of a technologically
superior military force  being thwarted by primitive indigenous
guerillas, like the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam.  (Remember, Lucas was
originally going to  follow up American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now,
so the Ewoks were probably his way of exploring that theme after

losing control of the project to Coppola.) In one □of□ the deleted
scenes □of Luke□ and Biggs  on Tatooine, Biggs expresses concern that the
Empire will draft Luke into service.  Star Wars is definitely a product

of the Watergate era, but  it came out during the Carter
administration, so everybody associates it with the goofy, hedonistic
late '70s.  By the '80s, Reagan and his speechwriters were using Lucas'
imagery as a metaphor for the Cold  War, something he probably never
anticipated or desired.  He never got over the use of □□□□□□Star Wars□□□□□□ as a
collective term for orbital missile defense.  In Ep. I, Lucas repays
Reagan in kind by naming  the perennially befuddled and dim-witted
Trade Federation leader Nute Gunray; the □□□□□□Nute□□□□□□ comes from Knute
Rockne All American, one of Reagan's best-known films, and as for
□□□□□□Gunray,□□□□□□□ just transpose □the□ syllables. □For a guy who celebrates forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure □hold a grudge; after all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael, who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I would be genuinely surprised if most viewers made any sort of
connections between the storyline in Ep. III and current events,
mainly because it sounds as though the political aspects of
Palpatine's rise to power are dowplayed  in favor of balls-to-the-wall
action.  (Besides, as we all know, Lucas had it planned out in advance
all along, so any parallels are purely coincidental.)  In all
likelihood, there will be one or two batshit  crazy right-wing  Medved
types who label Lucas a traitor after making all those good movies
about upholding conservative  values, but most people won't care or
notice.  And they'd be wrong about Lucas' politics, too; despite being
insanely wealthy, he  still seems to regard himself as a radical
experimental filmmaker and unreconstructed liberal who  managed to beat
the Man at his own game, acquiring his independence one marketing
license at a time.  (Insert sarcastic comment about billionaire
entertainer lecturing about the dangers of attachment and materialism
here.)  But even if he wanted to make Ep. III overtly political, I
doubt he'd be canny or subtle enough to pull it off, even in a dorky
Star Trek kinda way.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Ahoatam□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Well put, Louie, thanks. □That seems to be a perfectly reasonable explanation and by no means a stretch. □It's a subtext that fits perfectly.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to himself. □Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku? Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department to design a droid general. □Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of ROTJ because the darkside □had slowly degraded his appearance. He obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels: Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest has been made up as he went along. I mean he said himself in a recent interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority of the back story Lucas originally planned out.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's a very powerful piece of film-making and the first time we get
real characters and real emotion in the prequel trilogy. The ending is
near-perfect. Vader being entombed in the suit, Yoda's humility after
failing the Jedi and the Republic, the delivery of the twins. Amazing
stuff.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's perfectly obvious that the Jedi were responsible for their own
fall, paying the price for being blinded , dogmatic and overconfident.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And Lucas doesn't shy away from the fact that his movie is about
brother turning against brother. The characters face horrible dilemmas
and no one walks away unscathed.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The opening battle is awe-inspiring. Words can do it no justice. The
only thing I can say is that the reveal of the hundreds of capital
ships fighting far surpasses the reveal of the Star Destroyer in
Episode IV.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Grievous is a total red herring and a wild goose chase for Obi-Wan. If
you expect that, you'll like his part (which is a very minor one). If
you expect the death machine from the cartoons, you'll be
disappointed.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And there's a wickedly irreverent homage to E.T.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Finally, I predict that there will be a lot of wee ones crying their
little hearts out when Anakin starts burning alive. It's very graphic

again, I guess he doesnt fully come to grips with the SW Buddhist-lite

I guess the close-up on Yoda's face as the hatch shuts closed is what
really makes it an homage to E.T., if that's what it really is.  The
good-byes and ship take-off also work as homage but are also necessary
to getting Yoda off Kashyyk.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
By the way, I saw the film version and there was no scene depicting Wat Tambor's epic fight against anakin. Was that scene in the DLP version?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Wat Tambor was barely in the DLP version.  Just enough for the Cult of
Wat to jizz their slacks and for the rest of us to roll our eyes.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
To be fair, I was actually hoping to see more of Wat before he got
diced.  I was hoping to have a quick reminder of why I hate this
ill-conceived character before he is then thankfully murdered. □No such luck.□ Wat is merely a blur in his demise.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Estel□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□My take, copied and pasted from a message I wrote someone on the night
I saw it.  I reserve the right to modify this kneejerk opinion when I
see it again with a normal audience on release.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Yeah, it's not so good, but it's not a disaster. This one is
particularly frustrating for me, though, because it has entire moments
and scenes that DO play, that work emotionally, thematically, or
whatever, but are constantly being undermined by glaring problems:
poorly written/delivered lines, moments of weird, choppy, meaningless
editing (Ben Burtt fucks this movie backasswards just like Clones),
small scenelets that are over before they start (the 2nd act is
plagued by this), and just mismanaged stuff that could have been
great, or at least passable.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's just so painfully obvious that Lucas' reach exceeds his grasp.
There's some great non-verbal bits set to music: I loved the clones
turning on the jedi across the galaxy, beautiful score, and a real
sense of loss, but it's pretty contextless. Similarly, he goes for
this Coppola-esque Birth of the Twins/Birth of Vader intercutting
that's really magnificent all by itself (Padme's screams during labor
cutting to the absolutely wrecked Anakin screaming as his limbs are
re-attached) but it belongs in a different, better movie. He breaks
his own SW rules all over the place in this scene (there's actually a
POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation
chamber being in the suit is).
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
McDiarmid is nasty, campy fun, just as he was in ROTJ, and everyone
else pretty much acquits themselves admirably. McGregor has fantastic
moments, but also many, many others, where he clearly just can't take
this bullshit seriously anymore (see his lines to Dooku before they
fight). Portman and Christensen are much improved, especially
Christensen, who I think does an admirable job with an almost
unplayabe character. Who knows why anyone in this movie does anything,
other than puppetmaster Lucas.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I thought that much of the duel was really good, actually, contrary to
the Chud crew consensus. I actually thought that bar a few lines, the
last fourth of the film was a hint of the A-game that Lucas could have
brought to the whole deal, back in the day, had he cared to. He
clearly took his time with certain sequences (the purge/assault on the
temple, the massacre/baptism, oops I mean □□□□□□Birthing□□□□□□ sequence), and he
pretty much went ahead and neglected the connective tissue that makes
such sequences make sense, just like in the last film.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Again, before I'm torn to shreds, this is just quick thoughts jotted
down after seeing it last week.  I actually feel a little nicer to it
in the light of day.  I'll make up my mind on the 19th.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Amphibatron□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Wait, can someone confirm that the Wookiees give Tarzan yells like Chewbacca in Jedi?

My favourite shot in the whole film. It really ads depth to Vader
asking Luke to remove his helmet, so that he can see him with his own
eyes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
My favourite sequences (apart from the amazing opening) were centered
on Obi-Wan. His realisation of what he must do, his confrontation of
Padme and his final words with Anakin are really strong. Terrific
acting by Ewan.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Amphibatron□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□It does.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

been said in this thread.  My take is pretty much right in the middle
of everything mentioned here.  I didn't love it like I wanted to, but I
did enjoy it overall.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The sad thing is, I think if Anakin's turn to the dark side had
worked, everything else would be forgivable.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
My biggest regret about these films will always be that he directed
them all himself.  He could have stepped aside after TPM and let
someone else handle AOTC and ROTS.  Considering some of the names that
were said to be interested, I don't think we would have seen most of
the things that bugged me in those films.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I can't imagine Spielberg doing that crappy space diner scene or the
floating fruit scene.  I think He would have found some way to make the
Anakin-Padme dialogue work.  I can't imagine David Fincher having so
much droid comedy in ROTS, nor the terrible Windu death/Anakin turns
scene.  I also can't imagine him having Anakin hop on a droid's head
and ride over to continue the duel with Obi-Wan.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Amphibatron□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Not in my print. At least not in the foreground.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Does this mean I have to call the theatre and ask them if they are
showing the print with the retarded tarzan yell or without it?
Seriously, the only theatre getting my money is the one without. I'll
be damned if I'll relive the lowest point in the OT come may 19th.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Alan □□□□□□Nordling□□□□□□ Cerny□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Oh c'mon. □If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here. □It's as if people must have their SW totally humorless. □So Lucas can't tell a joke to save his ass, get over it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Amphibatron□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Oh c'mon. □If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here. □It's as if people must have their SW totally humorless. □So Lucas can't tell a joke to save his ass, get over it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Why should I have to stomach it to begin with? Can't Lucas make one
goddamn movie where I don't have to either stomach something , forgive
something, overlook something, pretend that didn't happen, fast
forward through that part, cover my ears, scratch out my eyes....□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Suttytx□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The Tarzan yell and the Sarlac burp in ROTJ are the two lowest points of humor in the OT for me. □Hate to see it repeated in ROTS.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Samurai Mike□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The Tarzan yell and the Sarlac burp in ROTJ are the two lowest points of humor in the OT for me. □Hate to see it repeated in ROTS.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The sarlacc burp was okay until Lucas changed the creature to the
Penis From Hell. Now it farts instead (and has teeth around its arse,
or something).□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I thought I might have heard the Tarzan yell buried beneath a shot
when a Wookiee jumps on a Seperatist vehicle but it was so covered
over with other sound effects and music, I couldn't be sure. (To be
honest, most of the Kashyyk stuff didn't really engage me, so I don't
remember a lot of the little details.) And yeah, just because the
Tarzan yell was in JEDI doesn't mean that it was ever a good idea.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Tom Roberts□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□91% at Rotten Tomatoes at the moment (22 reviews).

I don't think they're trying to force their opinions on anyone so much
as they're just pointing out that not everyone considers EP3 a
□□□□□□masterpiece□□□□□□ and that most of the positive reviews (so far) don't
either.  I think the overwhelming majority of people who see EP3 will
consider it a notable improvement over the last two Prequels (I sure
as hell do) but that doesn't mean it still doesn't have its own
troubling flaws that are just as worth discussing as its positive
attributes.  Checks and balances.  That's all.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

A bunch of the rviews on RT are positive for a highly anticipated summer event film? Shock, surprise! The bulk of the RT stuff comes from a release date, and if one is using RT as a measuring stick, then it's best to wait until then.

RT is fairly useless at any point of the process, except maybe just as
a long-term reference tool, or a collection of hyperlinks (much the
same way that I view Drudge).□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I think the only real shocker of any of the current reviews was
Alexandra DuPont at AICN going kinda nutty for the film. She was about
as savage on the prequels as anyone, but was entertaining and
magnificently lucid in her critiques.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Charlie Brigden□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed her review. And the Daily Mail, because

a general □□□□□□B+□□□□□□ vibe to the current reviews if you actually go in and
read them.  It's not 200 reviews, but if you consider it a 10-15%
sample than it's a halfway-decent bellwether. □ Everyone seems to agree

It seems that we were right about the script. Everything I've heard
from Nick, Devin, Russ and Steves reviews to the people that I know
that went to the screening in Bloomfield Twp, MI tell me that the
dialog we read in the script makes it's full on ham fisted appearance
on film.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
What makes it so painfully obvious that Lucas is a shit writer is that
the novelization was just so much better at telling HIS STORY!□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And I have a feeling that this entry of the franchise will fare worse
over time than TPM or AOTC.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I already have friends who after seeing the film, digesting it, and
thinking it over, are more upset at the missed opportunities displayed
here than the more obvious blunders of the earlier entries.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And it's funny that Nick, Devin et al have echoed what my friends
stated:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It is an entertaining summer movie, but Star Wars used to mean more
than that.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Waker□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□No, but apparantly you have a problem with Devin and Dre having their opinion.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

negative.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And these reviews still strike me as damage control, so the reviewer
can either come down on the positive or negative side once all is said
and done.  After all, it's not like anyone would want to have a review
contrary to popular opinion again, would they?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Holy Diver□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Especially not on CHUD. ;)□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Nothing wrong with having an opinion that's contrary to what's
popular. But some reviewers just go out of their way to be negative.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's a cynical world we live in these days. Where people can't enjoy
anything anymore without dissecting it and solely focusing on the ugly
parts.  I hate the kind of the review that's straddling the fence,
there's nothing wrong with actually digging the shit out of a movie
you know.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The prequels have been fun as hell in my opinion. Come May 19th, it's
the end of a great ride for a lot of us.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Yes you can be a Star Wars fan and hate the prequels, gnash your teeth
and call Lucas a fucking hack.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□

As for the 22 reviews, sure there will be 200 reviews for a movie like
star wars. But from looking at those 22 it's often good enough to get
a trend that will indicate what the other 80-90% of reviews will be
like. And that's why I posted it.

conventions, and I find it all a bit frightening. Once this guy met me
at a stage door when I was doing a play in London. The guy yelled,
'Obi-Wan. Do you have any advice for a trainee Jedi?' I just said,
'No, don't be so ridiculous.' If McGregor thinks that constantly being
asked to whip out his light saber is creepy, then he better prepare
himself for the reaction hell get from his upcoming project Gnomeo and
Juliet. Ewan will voice the character Gnomeo to Kate Winslets Juliet
in the story of indoor gnome-outdoor gnome love (and, no, we

Pseudo-random excerpts:□□□□□□□□□□□□□
This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the
best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my
inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than □□□□□□Star Wars.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
...□□□□□□□□□□□□□
But every picture, however ravishing, needs a story, and the best way
to appreciate how well this one succeeds is to consider the obstacles
it must surmount in winning over its audience. First of all, though
there are a few surprises tucked into the narrative (which I won't
give away), everybody knows the big revelation of the end, since it
was also the big revelation at the end of the previous trilogy: Darth
Vader is Luke's father. We also know, for the most part, which of the
major figures are going to survive the various perils they face. So an
element of suspense is missing from the outset.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
More than that, the trajectory of the narrative cuts sharply against
the optimistic grain of blockbuster Hollywood, in that we are
witnessing a flawed hero devolving into a cruel and terrifying
villain. It is a measure of the film's accomplishment that this
process is genuinely upsetting, even if we are reminded that a measure
of redemption lies over the horizon in □□□□□□Return of the Jedi.□□□□□□ And while
Mr. Christensen's acting falls short of portraying the full
psychological texture of this transformation, Mr. Lucas nonetheless
grounds it in a cogent and (for the first time) comprehensible
political context.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□This is how liberty dies - to thunderous applause,□□□□□□ Padm observes as
senators, their fears and dreams of glory deftly manipulated by
Palpatine, vote to give him sweeping new powers. □□□□□□Revenge of the Sith□□□□□□
is about how a republic dismantles its own democratic principles,
about how politics becomes militarized, about how a Manichaean
ideology undermines the rational exercise of power. Mr. Lucas is
clearly jabbing his light saber in the direction of some real-world
political leaders. At one point, Darth Vader, already deep in the
thrall of the dark side and echoing the words of George W. Bush,
hisses at Obi-Wan, □□□□□□If you're not with me, you're my enemy.□□□□□□ Obi-Wan's
response is likely to surface as a bumper sticker during the next
election campaign: □□□□□□Only a Sith thinks in absolutes.□□□□□□ You may applaud
this editorializing, or you may find it overwrought, but give Mr.
Lucas his due. For decades he has been blamed (unjustly) for helping
to lead American movies away from their early-70's engagement with
political matters, and he deserves credit for trying to bring them
back.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
But of course the rise of the Empire and the perdition of Anakin
Skywalker are not the end of the story, and the inverted chronology
turns out to be the most profound thing about the □□□□□□Star Wars□□□□□□ epic.
Taken together, and watched in the order they were made, the films
reveal the cyclical nature of history, which seems to repeat itself
even as it moves forward. Democracies swell into empires, empires are
toppled by revolutions, fathers abandon their sons and sons find their
fathers. Movies end. Life goes on.That's a solid three stars at the
very least. Interesting that Scott thinks the middle-is-the-end
chronology of the two trilogies works... that it not only works, but
resonates with the whole 'Force' theme of Star Wars.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I'm a little encouraged by that review. It's a better explanation for
liking the film than 'Darth Vader's in it!' and 'Wow, it looks just
like the original Star Wars at the end!' On the other hand, I wonder
if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting
George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth. Good fun for liberals like
myself, but not necessarily right for Star Wars.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Samurai Mike□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Isn't it funny how Padme comments on loss of liberty, when it was HER

This is what I'm trying to get at.  While most of the folks here
probably won't mind, and even enjoy such thinly-veiled criticism of
the current administration, I think to a decent portion of the
population it may come across as extreme partisanship.  While many of
you have illustrated Lucas' political subtexts in other SW films, I
think it's a lot more in-your-face in ROTS, which is very un-Star
Wars.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
So forgetting the fact that the film may endorse your own personal
view of the current administration (by your own, I mean anyone here),
it is wise for Lucas to risk dis-associating half of his audience who
simply wanted to see the end of a space opera and not an idictment on
the guy they voted for and maybe still have faith in?  Seriously, not
looking for a political lecture here, because no one's going to change
anyone's mind, just looking  for some honest looks at what this means
for Star Wars.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Granted, it could be argued that Lucas had this story set in '99,
before Bush, but I think the sudden thrust of politics to the center
of the Star Wars stage warrants some discussion.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□cognizant□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker with politics involved. □The trilogy could have just focused on him and Obi 1. □The Emperor and his political manoeuvres could has just been vaguely hinted at in the background of the universe. □I think the focus on politics was in part, written to raise SW slightly above that often derided concept of 'mass popular culture' to be taken slightly more seriously by adults and prehaps be perceived as something even integral, or meaningful to culture, rather than something to simply escape to for a few hours, but obviously Lucas has failed at this, the story has suffered as a result. □Seeing geeky teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
SW shouldnt be taken seriously, its an escapist adventure tale without
logic, but full of spunk.  Well, the first trilogy was anyway.  The
second trilogy appears to me as a schizophrenic mish mash of mediocre
sci-fi, and the frantic attempts of an ageing man trying to
update/modify/remix his legacy.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Micah Robinson□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□That's just silly. You can't depict the creation of a dictator-led
military empire without focusing on politics. Anakin's turn occurs
within this context, not outside of it. Besides, Palpatine's
machinations were scripted and depicted BEFORE Bush's war on Iraq.
Besides, the Jedi are the UN, and they certainly don't come off as
heroic, smart, or helpful in the least in this film, so there's
criticism of the Right and the Left to be found in spades. If people
can only see the obvious Bush metaphors, then they're not even really
looking at the film.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Charlie Brigden□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker with politics involved. □The trilogy could have just focused on him and Obi 1. □The Emperor and his political manoeuvres could has just been vaguely hinted at in the background of the universe. □I think the focus on politics was in part, written to raise SW slightly above that often derided concept of 'mass popular culture' to be taken slightly more seriously by adults and prehaps be perceived as something even integral, or meaningful to culture, rather than something to simply escape to for a few hours, but obviously Lucas has failed at this, the story has suffered as a result. □Seeing geeky teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I disagree. The trilogy isn't just about Anakin, but also the Empire,
and especially since Palpatine plays such an important role in
Anakin's development and eventual turn, all of Palpatine's
maneouverings are entirely necessary. For example, showing him getting
into the chancellor's position, his growing influence over the Jedi,
and subsequent acts against them. It's also the most interesting stuff
in all of the prequels.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
To be fair, ever since the 70s and the whole journal of the whills
deal, the rise of the Empire has always been described as this big
corruption of politics. I think saying it's trying to be taken
seriously by including politics is overly-cynical.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Actually, I would liked to have seen more of Palpatine's politics and
less of Jar Jar's...well, anything.  All of that precious screen time,
wasted.  (And that's not another tired criticism of what a terrible
character Jar Jar is...more like a criticism of Lucas' storytelling
priorities.)  When Palpatine and Anakin discuss the Sith during the
opera, I actually leaned forward in my theater seat.  More of the
phantom menace's origins would have been appreciated by this viewer.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□mastronikolas□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The politics were absolutely necessary for the story.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There's a clear parallel between the Republic rotting from the inside
and turning into a dictatorship and Anakin starting out as a decent
person and turning into evil incarnate.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And ultimately, the Senate scenes were about 20 minutes of screen time
out of six-and-a-half hours of story.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□cognizant□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Meeeh, I'll concede that it works with emphasis on politics, just
didnt work for me with this specific vision.  Besides, the OT hardly
has any politics, and those films are meant to depict the end of an
empire and the re-establishment of the status quo, or some type of
equilibrium, and all we get is a few throwaway lines about some senate
or something.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I still think the PT could have worked without any direct emphasis on
politics, it just would have been in the background, like online
political debates/campaign adverts, or news of conflicts or coup de
tat's, that characters would watch ocassionally to keep up to date
with the situation, or the presence of stormtroopers slowly
multiplying in more and more worlds, etc, it just could have been done
subtlely, rather than the way we've seen it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And I'll admit, that when it comes to SW, I'm very cynical, but I cant
help it, the over the top, and increasinly ridiculous merchandise
aspect just leaves me cold.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Micah Robinson□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Yes, relegating Ian McDarmid - the shining jewel of this installment
according to almost every review, even the negative ones - to a less
prominent role would certainly help the current Star Wars films work
better. Slice his screentime in half and let's have some more witty
battle droid banter.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Charlie Brigden□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Because the merchandise levels of the OT were low?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The point is, the OT never had politics because it was a different time.

Apologist! There's plenty of political stuff going on during a rebellion. Do you think that all the systems that joined the rebellion wanted the same power structure when it was all said and done? Do you think all the reps in whatever made up the rebellion high command (we don't even know their power structure! But we know all about the power structure of the old republic...) agreed from campaign to campaign? Weren't our heroes in the OT close enough to that power structure that we should have been in on these debates at least as much as we were in the PT?□□□□□□□□□□□□□

CANNES, France (CNN) -- □□□□□□Star Wars□□□□□□ director George Lucas says that
although he wrote the original film during the Vietnam War, his
six-part saga could apply to the war in Iraq.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
''In terms of evil, one of the original concepts was how does a
democracy turn itself into a dictatorship,'' Lucas told a news
conference at Cannes, where his final episode had its world premiere.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
''The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in
Iraq now are unbelievable.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
''On the personal level it was how does a good person turn into a bad
person, and part of the observation of that is that most bad people
think they are good people, they are doing it for the right reasons,''
he added.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

I like the prequels
for what they are, but I know in my gut they could've been so much
more.  I really wish Lucas would've kept his producing hat on, directed
the effects and animation sequences (where his true passions lie), and
left the screenwriting and directing the actors to someone(s) who
could interject a little humanity.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Most of the ideas, themes, even design and set pieces in the PT are
intellectually sound.  The problem is that no one feels anything.  And
if they do, generally its out of a sense of nostalgia rather than
immediate tugging at the heartstrings.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Lucas is a master visualist.  He also has a pretty good sense of story
structure and has some really innovative ideas.  The problem is the guy
is admittedly impatient when it comes to the writing and directing
processes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The politics of the PT are an interesting inclusion to the SW
storyline, but they are far too talky and overcomplicated for their
own good.  Much like this post.  Ahem, there is no immediate drama
involved in the politics until ROTS.  That to me, is a huge mistake.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The PT as well as Matrix: Reloaded and Matrix: Revolutions are
examples of first draft scripts, directors with too much power and no
one to check them, and misplaced priorities.  Best intentions, even
when they are completely revealed via commentaries, interviews, etc.,
cannot make up for lackluster execution.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

No, that's the main villain of the PT where boring politics are the forefront.

No thanks. McDarmid's evolution from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor is not only one of the best parts of the PT, but also the perfect platform for illustrating the arrogance and flaws of the Jedi.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Now, the separatist talks, along with the other irrelevant races and
the senate debates could have been minimized for sure. But anything
subtracting from McDarmid's screentime hurts these movies, IMHO.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□cognizant□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□No thanks.

Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been the wankers we have seen them to be. □Making them incredibly dull, brainless and flawed, makes their downfall so much easier to write. □Its harder to creatively bring about the downfall of something thats working right, but Lucas...□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Anyway my opinion still stands, the story of Anakin's fall did not
need focus on politics, or even the Emperor, as Devin says, this I'm
sure is a minority opinion, but I think still a valid one, any one of
us could come up with three screenplays that could be on par with the
OT without resorting to real world political allegories.  Well not any
one of us, but you get the jist.  If we were basing the PT off of what
we'd seen in the OT, all we'd essentially need, is the Clone Wars, and
thats it.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Defending the focus on politics, simply because of McDarmid's
performance, surely means that everything else was bollocks.  I'd
rather downsize his role, in exchange for a better trilogy of films as
a whole, with an exciting, original and involving narrative.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Ahoatam□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□From the very beginning, the PT is infused with overly complicated
politics, when in the OT there were virtually none.  Dispute over the
taxation of trade routes? □Wat???□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Why can't we give Padme a couple of throwaway lines to cover what's
going on in the Senate? □□□□□□□Okay, Anakin, pookie, I'm going to go vote

Totally agree with that. How could a group of such ignorant, close-minded, arrogant and just downright stupid people be the guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations? The prequels make it seem as if the Jedi were the architects of their own fate, rather than anything the Sith did. That could work, if only the last film wasn't called 'Return of the Jedi', where the Sith are brought down by Ewoks.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
And about the politics, I think there should have been a political aspect to the PT, just not the boring, oversimplified and poorly thought out politics we've seen.

vulnerable to the Sith, a la Rome and the Barbarians,but he blew that

the film I still don't understand the anakin conception deal.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Palpatine tells Anakin a story of a great Darth lord that knew the
darisk side of the force so well he could blah blah blah midichlorians
blah blah with merely a look.  All right, so according to the story,
Darth Plagus (Plagius, Plageus? whatev) conceived Anakin while Sidious
was his apprentice.  Sidious murders his master in his sleep and takes
over the Anakin plot himself.  That's what I got from it. And assuming
Palpatine is lying and did the whole scheme himself seems like a
pointless assumption. □□□□□□□Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.□□□□□□? □Not good enough. □He plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting axed in his sleep by his apprentice as if he was the one who did it. □If we can believe that □part, why can we not believe that Palpatine wasn't the telepathic sperm donor?□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I think the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up stories that take away from his supposed genius.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Rene A.

Good liars mix their lies with the truth though.  He could be telling
Anakin the truth about his master and at the same time leading Anakin
to believe that he is the one responsible for his creation.  That way
he hooks Anakin with the □□□□□□creating life□□□□□□ part and then goes on and
pits himself against Obi-Wan as a father figure.  And plus we've alrady
seen more or less the same scenario in Episdode 2 when Dooku tries to
recruit Obi-Wan.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Litmus Configuration□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I think the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up stories that take away from his supposed genius.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

thin.  Besides, Obi-Wan has told far more lies than Palpatine. □□□□□□□Certain point of view,□□□□□□ my ass.□ I'd wager that if you took all of Palpatine's
dialogue from the films and do the same with Obi-Wan, Palpy would win

truth (even if it is □□□□□□from a certain point of view□□□□□□) is one of the
most interesting facets of Sith.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Besides, I don't get the whole uproar about his □□□□□□revelation□□□□□□. I enjoy
the fact that Lucas leaves it to us to choose if Palpatine was behind
Anakin's creation or not. I much prefer that than being spoon-fed a
definite answer.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Satan's Hamster□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I intend on seeing this flick after consuming the sufficient amount of beer. □By □□□□□□sufficient□□□□□□ I mean, whatever amount necessary that it would make me at least laugh out loud to even the bad jokes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Hmmmmm....and thats the dilemma. □Not enough beer, and I will feel my ass getting numb. □Too much, and I'll just pass out and miss the whole thing. □Er....my vote is for too much.□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Beer seems to be the necessary item so that someone could tolerate this movie. □Hey, is there even a □□□□□□beer drinking game□□□□□□ possible in this installment?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Don't go crying if you get alcohol poisoning! I think there sould be a
drinking game where you have to do a shot of vodka every time someone
says something stupid, in which case, should you die after seeing the

OT because The Empire had been in control for close to 20 years and I
doubt that the Rebellion would have very successful by launching a
political attack when the Emperor would just fry their ass with Sith
Lightning. If this was Mr. Skywalker Goes To Washington, A New Hope
wouldn't have been about trying to destroy a Death Star, it would have
been about Luke going to the Galactic senate and making his case that
the Empire is evil and that the Emperor and Darth Vader were very
naughty men while wagging his finger at them as the senate hiss and
boo as they slide into the shadows. Politics are at the very heart of
how Palpatine takes over the senate and to ignore that for more space
battles would be stupid and Im quite sure that most of the people that
are bitching and moaning about the politics here are Republicans and
they dont particularly like looking into the mirror because theyre all
fucking monkeys with their eyes, mouth and ears closed!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Satan's Hamster□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Another thing fuckwads, how the hell did you think Hitler got to power.

That said, this movie has got serious fucking issues.  The main being
Hayden Christiansen and his Smarm/Assfucker/Whine approach to acting.

If someone could kill him?  That would be great.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The other being C-3P0.  Sweet Jesus.

Also, I would've thought Anakin's fall to the Dark Side would've been
handled with a little more......skill.  What we have here is the
equivalent of □□□□□□I'm a Dark Lord of Sith.......NOW!□□□□□□ It's total
bullshit.

All in all, a mostly fun movie and lots of prayers the Lucas NEVER BE
ALLOWED TO DIRECT ANYTHING EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□robotpals□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

Completely, and it's a good indication of Lucas' cluelessness as a
screenwriter.□□□□□□□□□□□□□

close a post release thread just as the film is opening.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□robotpals□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Last!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
