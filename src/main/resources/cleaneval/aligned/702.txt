THE MANUSCRIPT, WRITTEN IN A LINED NOTEBOOK, DATES FROM ABOUT----------------------- HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM--- AND--- ANSWERS TO- HYDRANTMAN'S EXAMINATION-- HYDRANTMAN'S- RULES-- ORDINANCES-- ---OO0OO----------- OBJECT OF INSTALLING- SYSTEM------------------- TO REDUCE THE FIRE AND CONFLAGRATION HAZARD TO A- MINIMUM.-- FIRST: TO PRACTICALLY DISPENSE WITH THE USE OF STEAM PORTABLE FIRE- ENGINES.-- SECOND: TO SUPPLY SUFFICIENT WATER AT THE SCENE OF AN INCIPIENT FIRE, TO- EXTINGUISH IT IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.-- THIRD: TO QUICKLY CONCENTRATE LARGE VOLUMES- OF WATER ON AREA IN WHICH A FIRE MAY HAVE REACHED DANGEROUS PROPORTIONS.-- FOURTH: TO- FURNISH IN EMERGENCY AS MUCH WATER AS CAN BE USED TO ADVANTAGE BY THE FIRE- DEPARTMENT.----------------- THE REASON GRAVITY SYSTEM IS- SUPERIOR------------------- THIS METHOD OF SUPPLY POSSESSES DECIDED ADVANTAGES OVER- ALL OTHERS BECAUSE OF ITS POSITIVENESS AND ECONOMY OF OPERATION AND THE SHORT TIME REQUIRED- TO GET THE WATER ON A FIRE. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TELEPHONE TO A CENTRAL STATION AND START- PUMPS, OR TO MAKE CONNECTIONS TO FIRE BOATS. AND IT POSSESSES NONE OF THE VARIOUS- UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT TO COMPLICATED MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.-- PUTTING TWIN PEAKS- RESERVOIR IN SERVICE, IT WILL INCREASE STATIC PRESSURE-AT BASE 168 POUND-TO SQUARE INCH IN- LOWER ZONE.----------------  A----------------------------------DVANTAGES  BRIEFLY ARE-AS FOLLOWS:-- FIRST: IT ELIMINATES STEAM FIRE ENGINES WHICH HITHERTO HAVE BEEN- THE MAIN RELIANCE. IT IS THUS A-MEASURE OF-GREAT ECONOMY. IT ALSO REDUCES EXCITEMENT WHICH- IS IMPORTANT NEAR SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS.-- SECOND: IT REDUCES THE ADDITIONAL ALARMS AND- NUMBERS OF COMPANIES AND APPARATUS REQUIRED.-- THIRD: THE SUPPLY OF WATER IS BETTER AND- MORE POWERFUL. SALTWATER COULD BE HAD ON SHORT NOTICE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY FROM TWO- SALTWATER PUMPING STATIONS. SHOULD THIS SUPPLY PROVE INADEQUATE, IT CAN BE INCREASED BY- TWO FIRE BOATS.-- FOURTH: STRETCHES ARE SHORTER, MEANING QUICKER WORK AND GREATER- ECONOMY OF HOSE AND MEN.---FIFTH:------------------------------- IT GREATLY REDUCES- INSURANCE RATES----. WITHIN A NUMBER OF YEARS (THE SYSTEM) WILL PAY FOR- ITSELF.----------------  HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANTS------------------- THE CAPACITY OF- A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT DEPENDS UPON THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE AT THE MAIN. THE CAPACITY- WHEN THE PRESSURE IS AT-ITS HIGHEST-AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 3,0---GALS-PER MINUTE. THE DIAMETER-ON- THE VARIOUS VALVES ON A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT ARE MAIN VALVES, PILOT VALVE 3'' DIAMETER- SQUARE INDEPENDENT 3 1/2 REDUCED TO 3 INCHES WITH REDUCERS.-WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONE- FACING STREET-WHICH IS 3-----INCHES.--- THE PILOT VALVE IS A SMALL VALVE PLACED IN THE CENTER- OF THE MAIN VALVE,-IT IS USED-AS A BYPASS. THE DIAMETER OF THE MAIN VALVE IS-SEVEN INCHES.- THE SERVICE AREA: ---SQUARE INCHES.-- THE ACTION OF THE VALVE IS IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION- WHEN OPENING, AND THE MOVEMENT IS AGAINST THE COURSE OR PRESSURE OF WATER ENTERING THE- STANDPIPE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD-BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE AN OPENING ON A- HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT.-- THEREFORE, THE OBJECT OF THE PILOT VALVE IS TO MEET THESE- CONDITIONS SO THAT AN OPENING CAN BE AFFECTED IN ANY HIGH PRESSURE. THE PILOT, WHICH IS- INSIDE THE MAIN VALVE, EQUALIZES THE PRESSURE ABOVE AND BELOW THE MAIN VALVE AND HAS A- 3 INCH DIAMETER AND A SURFACE OF 7 SQUARE INCHES.-- THE PILOT IN THE MAIN VALVE IS SO--ARRANGED THAT THE FIRST TURN OF THE-STEM OPERATES THE SMALL VALVE INSIDE ONLY, AND THEREFORE--ALLOWS THE WATER TO PASS THE PILOT VALVE AND THE MAIN VALVE INTO THE STAND PIPE OF THE- HYDRANT.-- CAPACITY: 9950 GALS PER MINUTE, WITH THREE OUTLETS AT 150 POUNDS PRESSURE- EXCLUSIVE OF FRICTION LOSS.----------------  METHODS OF USING- SYSTEM------------------- PRESSURE IN JONES ST. TANK LOWER ZONE:-- IF GREATER- PRESSURE IS REQUIRED, A SIGNAL IS SENT CALLING FOR ASHBURY PRESSURE OR FROM TWIN PEAKS- RESERVOIR. IF JONES ST. PRESSURE IS NOT SUFFICIENT, GATEMAN AT JONES ST. OPERATES PROPER- VALVES TO PERMIT WATER FROM ASHBURY OR TWIN PEAKS TO FLOW DIRECT INTO LOWER ZONE.--- IF- TWIN PEAKS IS-CALLED FOR, GATEMAN AT ASHBURY TANK OPERATES PROPER VALVES AND PERMITS- FLOW FROM TWIN PEAKS DIRECT INTO MAINS. IN CONNECTING TO A HYDRANT, SEE THAT THE- INDEPENDENT VALVE IS CLOSED. CONNECT REGULATING VALVE AND SEE THAT IT IS SHUT OFF.--- OPEN- KING VALVE, OPEN INDEPENDENT OUTLET VALVE. WAIT FOR ORDERS TO TURN ON WATER. OPERATE- REGULATING VALVE ACCORDING TO PRESSURE ORDERED.----------------  A DESCRIPTION OF THE- HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM------------------- THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CONSISTS-OF LINES OR- MAINS, DIAMETER OF SAME VARYING FROM 10 TO 20 INCHES EXTENDING ABOUT 9 1/2 MILES- THROUGHOUT THE CONGESTED VALUE DISTRICT, THE IMPORTANT RETAIL, WHOLESALE AND-HOTEL DISTRICTS- AND A LARGE PART OF THE RESIDENCE DISTRICT.-- THREE-WAY HYDRANTS ARE CONNECTED TO THE MAINS- WITH SUBLETS OF 3 1/3 INCHES, TWO OUTLETS REDUCED-TO 3 INCHES. 1350 HYDRANTS ARE USED AND- 1120 GATES SO PLACED THAT WHEN REPAIRS ARE NECESSARY ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE SYSTEM- MAY BE OUT OF SERVICE.-- PROVISION IS MADE TO CUT OUT THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CITY WHERE AN- EARTHQUAKE WOULD-BY MOST LIKELY TO-DAMAGE THE-SYSTEM.-----  THE SYSTEM IS FED FROM- THE FOLLOWING SOURCES:------- TWIN PEAKS RESERVOIR AT AN ELEVATION OF 758 FEET AT WATER- LEVEL CAPACITY OF 10,500,000 GALLONS.-- ASHBURY-TANK AT AN-ELEVATION OF 494 FEET AT WATER- LEVEL CAPACITY OF 500,000 GALLONS.-- JONES ST. TANK AT AN ELEVATION-OF 369 FEET AT WATER- LEVEL CAPACITY OF 750,00--GALLONS.-- THE-SYSTEM IS DIVIDED INTO TWO ZONES. JONES ST.- TANK SUPPLIES THE LOWER ZONE. ASHBURY TANK SUPPLIES THE UPPER ZONE. STATIC PRESSURE AT THE- BASE OF THE LOWER ZONE-IS 160 POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH. WITH ASHBURY PRESSURE ON, THE- LOWER ZONE PRESSURE AT CITY BASE IS 214 POUNDS. TWIN PEAKS PRESSURE AT CITY BASE WOULD BE- ABOUT 328 POUNDS TO SQUARE INCH.-- TWO SALTWATER PUMPING STATIONS WITH 10,800 GALLONS- PER MINUTE CAPACITY FOR EACH. THESE STATIONS HAVE FOUR STEAM MULTI-STAGE TURBINE PUMPS,- ONE LOCATED AT THE FOOT OF VAN NESS AVENUE-AND ONE AT SECOND AND TOWNSEND STS MAY ALSO- PUMP INTO THE SYSTEM.-- TWO FIRE BOATS EACH WITH A CAPACITY OF 10,000 GALLONS PER MINUTE- MAY PUMP INTO THE SYSTEM FROM MANIFOLDS, EACH WITH TEN INLETS LOCATED AT THE FOOT OF- WASHINGTON AND THE FOOT OF POWELL ST. THE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SPRING VALLEY WATER- COMPANY AND S.F. BAY.-- THE SPRING VALLEY WATER IS MAINLY TAKEN FROM CLARENDON- HEIGHT THROUGH ASHBURY PUMPING STATION AND PUMPED TO TWIN PEAKS BY TWO CENTRIFUGAL- PUMPS DRIVEN BY TWO----HORSEPOWER-ELECTRIC MOTORS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF DELIVERING- 700 GALLONS A MINUTE EACH AGAINST 125 POUND HEAD. ASHBURY TANK, ELEVATION 4---FEET, IS FILLED--BY GRAVITY-FROM SPRING VALLEY CLARENDON HEIGHTS TANK TAKEN THROUGH 6-INCH PIPE, ELEVATION- 600 FEET.-- JONES ST. TANK, ELEVATION 334 FEET, IS MAINLY FILLED FROM ASHBURY TANK. IN- EMERGENCY JONES ST. TANK COULD BE FILLED BY THE SPRING VALLEY TANK, CLAY ST. AT AN- ELEVATION OF 375 FEET.-- ALARMS ARE RECEIVED AT ALL RESERVOIR PUMPING STATIONS AND FIRE- BOATS OVER A CIRCUIT BEING DIRECT ON A PUNCH REGISTER. THESE ARE TERMED HIGH-PRESSURE- CALLS.-- PUMPING STATIONS, TO PUMP CAPACITY AGAINST 335 POUNDS PRESSURE PER SQUARE INCH,- ARE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT FUEL AND FRESH WATER TO CONTINUE 7 HOURS.-- FIRE BOATS ARE ABLE- TO PUMP 10,000 GALLONS A MINUTE AGAINST 150 POUNDS PRESSURE OR 5,000 GALLONS A MINUTE- AGAINST 325 POUNDS PRESSURE, PER SQUARE INCH.-- IT (THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM) PROTECTS ALL- THE SECTION-OF THE CITY LOCATED WITHIN THE FOLLOWING BOUNDARIES AND CAN BE USED FOR SOME- DISTANCE OUTSIDE THIS DISTRICT:-- ALL THAT SECTION OF THE CITY EAST OF GOLDEN GATE PARK-FROM- MAINS-ON CLAYTON-AND-ASHBURY ST.-- WESTERN ADDITION: EXTREME WESTERLY MAIN ON--DEVISADERO-ST.-RUNNING TO-PACIFIC AVE. TO VAN NESS AVE. TO POLK-ST. ALONG VAN-NESS AVE. -TO THE BAY, THAT SECTION EAST OF-VAN NESS AVE. SOUTH OF MARKET WEST SO FAR AS CASTRO AND- SOUTH SO FAR AS 29TH. TWENTY-SIXTH ALONG HARRISON-AND FOLSOM, BERRY STREET AND THE BAY- SHORE.---A SHORT EXTENSION RUNS FROM 8TH AND TOWNSEND TO 15TH-AND KANSAS TO A DEAD- END.-- SPECIAL VALVES FOR REINFORCING THE LOWER ZONE ARE AT SEVENTEENTH-WEST OF CASTRO AND- MARKET ST. WEST OF SECOND. THESE HAVE 16 GATES.-- THE TWO GATES WOULD BE ORDERED OPEN- IN CASE OF AN EXTRA LARGE FIRE, OR FIRES-WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WAS USING MORE WATER THAN THE- 18-INCH PIPE LEAVING JONES ST. TANK COULD SUPPLY TO THE LOWER ZONE.-- UNDER ORDINARY- CONDITIONS, TWIN PEAKS AND ASHBURY RESERVOIRS ARE PUT IN SERVICE TO LOWER JONES THROUGH- MANIFOLDS IN THE GATE HOUSE AT JONES TANK. THE EXTRA PRESSURE OF ASHBURY OR TWIN PEAKS- WILL PUT JONES ST. TANK OUT OF SERVICE AUTOMATICALLY.----------------  FIRE- BOATS------------------- TWO PUMPS INSTALLED IN EACH BOAT.-EACH PUMP HAS 2 UNIT- MULTI-STATE TURBINE TYPE. THE CASING OF SOME-OF THE PUMPS WILL BE MADE SUFFICIENTLY STRONG- TO WITHSTAND A PRESSURE OF---0 POUNDS PER-SQ. INCH. ---THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE PIPES- WILL BE ARRANGED SO THAT EACH PUMP MAY BE CONNECTED TO DRAW WATER FROM THE BAY AND- DELIVER IT INTO THE DELIVERY PIPES ON THE BOAT, OR ONE PUMP MAY DELIVER FROM THE BAY INTO THE- SUCTION OF THE OTHER AT A PRESSURE OF 150 POUNDS PER SQ.-INCH AND THIS PUMP WILL INCREASE- THE PRESSURE TO 300 POUNDS PER SQ.-INCH AND DISCHARGE INTO DELIVERY PIPES OF THE- BOAT.-- BY THIS MEANS A PUMPING SET MAY DELIVER 4,000 GALLONS PER MINUTE AGAINST A- PRESSURE OF 150 POUNDS PER SQ. INCH OR 2,000 GALLONS PER MINUTE AGAINST A PRESSURE OF- 300 POUNDS PER SQ. INCH.-------------  LOCATION OF FIRE BOAT- MANIFOLD--- H.P. SYSTEM CONNECTIONS----------------------  FOOT OF- LAGUNA ST.

REMOVE ALL FITTINGS THEREFROM. USE WRENCH THAT IS- SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE. SAID WRENCH HAS A LONG CYLINDER AND BOTTOM IS- CONSTRUCTED AS TO FIT THE LOGS OF THE FALSE BRONZE SEAT RING.-- I WOULD GIVE WRENCH A FEW- TURNS TO THE LEFT AND UNSCREW. AFTER THIS WAS DONE, I WOULD-PULL-WRENCH OUT-OF STANDPIPE.- THEN I WOULD PULL SPINDLE OUT OF STANDPIPE WITH VALVES ATTACHED. TAKE OFF---IRON NUTS, TAKE- OFF HOLD DOWN NUT BRONZE, REMOVE OLD LEATHER SEAT, PUT NEW LEATHER SEAT ON SCREW ON- FITTINGS NAMED ABOVE AND ASSEMBLE IN SAME-MANNER.-- NOTIFY BATTALION CHIEF AND 1ST -ALARM COMPANY.--------  WHAT CARE AND ATTENTION DO VALVES, HYDRANTS AND MAN HOLES- REQUIRE?---------- VALVES AND HYDRANTS SHOULD BE INSPECTED EACH-WEEK; SHOULD BE- WIPED, OILED, TESTED AND IF ANY LEAK SHOULD BE SEEN-AROUND GLANDS, SHOULD BE TAKEN UP OR- REPACKED. HOSE CONNECTIONS-ON HYDRANTS SHOULD ALSO BE-INSPECTED AND HYDRANTMAN SHOULD- BE POSITIVE THAT ALL THREADS ON SAME WERE NOT JAMMED SO FIREMAN WOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE- CONNECTING HOSE.-- MAN HOLES SHOULD BE INSPECTED AND KEEP DRY, FREE FROM WATER.- SPINDLES ON ALL OUTLETS SHOULD BE MADE TO WORK FREELY. BY OPENING INDEPENDENT SLIDE VALVE- AND KEEPING MAIN VALVE CLOSED, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO KNOW WHETHER MAIN VALVE SEAT WAS- TIGHT AND IN GOOD ORDER. TO INSPECT THE INDEPENDENT VALVE, KEEP SAME CLOSED AND OPEN MAIN- VALVE.----------------  PARTS OF A GATE VALVE------------------- BODY: 2 BRONZE- SEAT RINGS SCREWED INTO CASTING. SINGLE DISC BONNET SPINDLE, STUFFING BOX, GLAND GEARS, GEAR- BRACKET, OPERATING NUT, INDICATOR STEM, ELBOWS AND BYPASS.. ALSO BUSHING.--------  IF A- HYDRANT WAS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY-WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK FOR THE- TROUBLE?------------------- I WOULD IMMEDIATELY LOOK FOR FAULT IN VALVE SEAT. IT COULD BE- POSSIBLE FOR A SMALL ROCK OR PIECE OF WOOD TO GET IN BETWEEN VALVE AND SEAT. AND THE SAME- MIGHT JAM VALVE SO IT WOULD NOT SEAT PROPERLY AND CASE A LEAK. IT WOULD ALSO BE NOTICEABLE- ON TOP OF SPINDLE. IF I THOUGHT THE VALVE WAS DAMAGED TO ANY EXTENT, I WOULD INSTALL A NEW- ONE.---------  IF YOU FIND A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT BROKEN AT ITS OUTLET WHAT WOULD YOU- DO?---------- I WOULD SHUT OFF THE GATE ON THE HYDRANT BRANCH, NOTIFY THE BATTALION CHIEF -AND 1ST ALARM COMPANY, AND-ALSO SUPT.-OF SYSTEM TO SEND ME-A NEW HYDRANT AND 2-LABORERS.- EXCAVATE DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE HYDRANT WHICH IS ABOUT 5 FEET, UNSCREW STUDS BETWEEN THE- FOOT OF THE HYDRANT AND THE STAND PIPE. LIFT SAME OUT WITH THE AID OF A TRIPOID AND INSTALL NEW- ONE I HAD RECEIVED. TEST SAME, NOTIFY BATT. CHIEF OF DISTRICT AND 1ST ALARM COMPANY AND -REPORT SAME TO SUPT. OF SYSTEM.--------  HOW WOULD YOU DRAIN-A PORTION OF-THE SYSTEM.- SAY ONE BLOCK FOR-REPAIRS?---------- I WOULD CLOSE DOWN 2 GATES AT THE INTERSECTING- STREETS SO AS TO CUT OFF SUPPLY IN THAT PARTICULAR BLOCK. OPEN HYDRANTS WHEN WATER STOPPED- FLOWING OUT OF HYDRANTS. BY THIS MEANS THE SECTION WOULD BE DRY- DRAINED.--------  HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED TO FILL PIPES AGAIN?---------- I WOULD- PLUG PORTION OF PIPE I HAD TAPPED. LEAVE HYDRANT OPEN TO LET AIR ESCAPE. OPEN SECTION GATE- VERY LOW. AFTER I HAD LINE FULL, I WOULD OPEN OTHER SECTION GATE.-- I WOULD KNOW THAT- SECTION WAS FULL OF SOLID WATER WHEN HYDRANT AT HIGHEST ELEVATION FLOWED- FREELY.--------  HOW WOULD YOU TEST A NEW SECTION OF MAINS AND HYDRANTS IN TRENCHES- TO DETERMINE WHETHER SECTION WAS TIGHT OR NOT AND WOULD STAND MAXIMUM WORKING- PRESSURE?---------- I WOULD ATTACH A LINE FROM A LOW PRESSURE HYDRANT AND CONNECT TO- SUCTION OF HAND PUMP. CONNECT A LINE FROM DISCHARGE HAND PUMP TO OUTLET OF HIGH PRESSURE- HYDRANT. SEE THAT ALL OTHER HYDRANTS WERE OPEN TO LET AIR ESCAPE. OPERATE LOW PRESSURE- HYDRANT SLOW AFTER WATER WAS COMING OUT OF HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT. I WOULD CLOSE SAME AND--WORK HAND PUMP TO PRESSURE REQUIRED WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT 450 POUNDS PER SQ. INCH.- EXAMINE ALL JOINTS OF PIPE AND HYDRANT-BRANCHES AND FOOT OF HYDRANT. IF FOUND THE SAME IN- GOOD ORDER, I WOULD DISCONNECT HAND PUMP, CLOSE HIGH AND LOW-PRESSURE HYDRANTS, OPEN- SECTION GATE AND LET STATIC HEAD COME THROUGH. THE TEST HYDRANT VALVES AND REPORT SAME IN- GOOD ORDER, READY FOR SERVICE.--------  DESCRIBE THE PROPER METHOD OF BLOWING OFF A- HYDRANT ON A CROWDED OR NARROW STREET.---------- I WOULD SHUT DOWN GATE VALVE, MUFFLE- HYDRANT OUTLET WITH SACK OR OTHER CLOTH MATERIAL, OPEN HYDRANT TO ITS FULL OPENING AND BLOW IT- OFF FROM THE GATE VALVE.--------  DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF TESTING STAND PIPE, 14 STORY- BUILDING.---------- I WOULD INSPECT SAID STANDPIPE BEGINNING AT BASEMENT, ASCEND- TOWARD ROOF, CLOSELY EXAMINE ALL VALVES AND OUTLETS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF VALVE ON ROOF- WHICH I WOULD OPEN TO ALLOW THE AIR TO ESCAPE.-- THEN I WOULD RETURN TO STREET, CONNECT- HOSE TO HYDRANT, TO OUTLET OF PUMP. [TAKE] ANOTHER PIECE OF HOSE FROM DISCHARGE END OF- PUMP TO INLET OF STANDPIPE SIAMESE. TURN ON WATER AT HYDRANT WHEN IT REACHED THE ROOF AND- FLOWED FREELY THROUGH VALVE ON ROOF. CLOSE ROOF VALVE WHICH WILL GIVE HYDRANT PRESSURE.- RETURN TO PUMP AND WORK PUMP UNTIL GAUGE SHOWED REQUIRED PRESSURE WHICH WOULD BE- ABOUT 300 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. THEN EXAMINE STANDPIPE. FINDING SAME IN GOOD- CONDITION, I TURNED OFF WATER AT HYDRANT, RELEASE PRESSURE BY OPENING JET COCK ON- PUMP.-- RETURN TO GROUND FLOOR, OPEN DRAIN VALVE LOCATED AT BOTTOM OF STANDPIPE. WHEN- PROPERLY DRAINED, DISCONNECT HOSE AT HYDRANT TO PUMP, FROM PUMP TO INLET OF STANDPIPE- SIAMESE, REPLACED ALL CAPS AND PLUG. CLOSE ROOF VALVE AND REPORT SAME.--------  WHAT- ARE THE DUTIES OF A HYDRANTMAN WITH REGARD TO CISTERNS?---------- HE SHALL EXAMINE ALL- CISTERNS IN HIS DISTRICT ONCE EACH WEEK. KEEP THEM FULL OF WATER. SEE THAT THEY ARE READY FOR- IMMEDIATE USE AT ALL TIMES. IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO IMPAIR THEIR STABILITY, THESE SHOULD- BE REPORTED TO THE BATTALION CHIEF OF DISTRICT AND SUPT. OF HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM. THERE ARE- 58 CISTERNS WHICH VARY FROM 18,000 GALLONS AND UP. TWO CISTERNS LOCATED IN CIVIC CENTER,- ONE UNDER EACH FOUNTAIN.-- WITH THE NEW BOND ISSUE THERE WILL BE 85 REINFORCED- CISTERNS.--------  EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE AND USE OF THE BYPASS ON HIGH PRESSURE GATE- VALVES.---------- A BYPASS ON A GATE VALVE IS USED TO EQUALIZE THE PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDE- OF DISCS SO IT MAY BE EASY TO OPERATE.-----  HYDRANTMAN'S DUTIES IN REGARD TO A HIGH- PRESSURE HYDRANTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:------ FIRST: UNSCREW TWO NUTS WHICH ALLOWS COVERS TO- BE TAKEN OFF. OPEN CAP ON 3 1/2 INCH OUTLET. OPEN THE MAIN-VALVE IN THE SAME HOLE BORED FOR- THAT PURPOSE. CLOSE MAIN COVER, OPEN 3 INCH OUTLET INDEPENDENT VALVE WHICH RELEASES- PRESSURE. THEN PROCEED TO TAKE OFF ALL CAPS AND OPEN ALL INDEPENDENT VALVES. WIPE ALL- FITTINGS WITH A PIECE OF WASTE SATURATED WITH KEROSENE SO AS TO FREE THE SAME FROM ALL DUST.- OIL ALL INDEPENDENT VALVES AND BUSHING. OIL ALL OUTLETS. CLOSE INDEPENDENT VALVES, SEE THAT- SAME ARE NOT MANNED. SCREW ON CAPS ON OUTLETS. BE SURE THAT MAIN VALVE IS SEATED. IF MAIN- VALVE SHOULD LEAK THROUGH GLAND, SAME SHOULD BE TAKEN UP OR REPACKED.--- AFTER HYDRANT- IS PUT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION, THE NUMBER OF SAME AND ALSO HYDRANT GATE SHOULD BE- NOTED. HYDRANT GATE SHOULD BE INSPECTED AND SAME KEPT FREE FROM WATER. IF THE FRAME OF- SAID GATE HAD SUNK BELOW THE GRADE OF STREET, IT SHOULD BE REPORTED ON DAILY REPORT.-- THE- VAULTS OF SECTION GATES IN A HYDRANTMAN'S DISTRICT SHOULD BE INSPECTED. IF BY ANY REASON- WATER OR GAS WAS FOUND IN SAME, IT SHOULD BE REPORTED. IF SEEPAGE SHOULD BE NOTICED- COMING THROUGH ANY OF THE HIGHWAYS SAME SHOULD BE REPORTED TO WATER COMPANY OR SUPT.- OF SYSTEM.----------------  HYDRANTMAN'S RULES------------- RULE NO.---------------- 24 SECTION--- 1 HYDRANT MEN SHALL ATTEND TO ALL HYDRANTS AND CISTERNS IN- THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS, SEE THAT THE SAME ARE KEPT IN GOOD CONDITION AND READY AT ALL TIMES- FOR IMMEDIATE USE.-- SECTION------- THEY SHALL SEE THAT HYDRANTS ARE AT ALL TIMES KEPT FREE- FROM OBSTRUCTIONS OF EVERY CHARACTER SO THAT ACCESS THERETO MAY BE READILY HAD BY ENGINE- COMPANIES.-- SECTION------ THEY SHALL VISIT AND INSPECT THE CISTERNS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE- DISTRICTS ONCE EACH WEEK. KEEP THE SAME FILLED WITH WATER AND SEE THEY ARE IN PROPER- CONDITION AND READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE AT ALL TIMES.-- THEY SHALL REPORT THE CONDITION OF THE- CISTERNS TO THE BATTALION CHIEF OF THE DISTRICT SAID CISTERNS ARE LOCATED.
