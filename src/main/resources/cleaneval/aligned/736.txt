CARMONA, M.D., M.P.H, FACS---- UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL---- U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES--------- NATIONAL MEDICAL LEADERS MEETING----------------- THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 20-------WASHINGTON, D.C.-------------- "PREVENTION AND-TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL ABUSE:-VISION AND STRATEGIES----------------------" THANKS FOR THAT TERRIFIC INTRODUCTION, DR. RUNGE. (DR. JEFFREY RUNGE,- ADMINISTRATOR, NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION)------- DR. RUNGE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM OF IMPAIRED DRIVING.- I-D LIKE TO BACK UP FOR A FEW MINUTES AND DESCRIBE FOR YOU THE FUNDAMENTAL- LARGER PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY: THAT OF ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY,- WHICH CAN LEAD TO IMPAIRED DRIVING AND A VARIETY OF-OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL -AND HEALTH PROBLEMS.---------THE GREAT AMERICAN-WRITER F. SCOTT FITZGERALD, HIMSELF AN-ALCOHOLIC,-SAID- THIS OF HIS ADDICTION:----- "FIRST YOU TAKE A DRINK, THEN THE-DRINK TAKES A DRINK,- THEN THE DRINK TAKES YOU.----------------" ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY AND ALCOHOL ABUSE----------- THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION-S (SAMHSA)- 2001 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE ESTIMATES THAT 16.6 MILLION AMERICANS- 12 OR OLDER-------------- -- 7.3% OF OUR POPULATION-------------- -- ARE DEPENDENT UPON OR ABUSE EITHER ALCOHOL- OR ILLICIT DRUGS.------------ DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE AFFECT INDIVIDUALS OF ALL AGES, FROM ALL- GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND ALL ETHNICITIES, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT LEVELS.------------- NO ONE IS IMMUNE, AND WE CANNOT ASSUME THAT ANY PARTICULAR PATIENT IS NOT- ALCOHOL DEPENDENT WHEN WE SEE HIM OR HER IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM, OR ANY OTHER- CLINICAL SETTING.------------- FOR EXAMPLE, ALCOHOL-RELATED CONSEQUENCES OF HEAVY DRINKING-------------- -- DEPRESSION, HEART- FAILURE, AND FREQUENT FALLS-------------- -- CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR MEDICAL-OR-PSYCHIATRIC- CONDITIONS COMMON AMONG THE ELDERLY.------------- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE ALL-PEOPLE ABOUT THE-RISKS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY.- I'M CONVINCED MANY PEOPLE-------------- -- YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY-------------- -- THINK THEY ARE IMMUNE.------------ HHS SECRETARY TOMMY THOMPSON HAS CHARGED ME WITH IMPROVING HEALTH LITERACY IN- AMERICA, AND NOWHERE IS THIS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IN THE AREA OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE.------------ RATES FOR ILLICIT DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND ABUSE ARE HIGHEST AMONG- AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES AT 12.6 PERCENT; FOLLOWED BY HISPANICS (7.-8 PERCENT); CAUCASIANS (7.5 PERCENT); BLACKS (6.2 PERCENT); AND ASIANS, NATIVE- HAWAIIANS, OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDERS (3.7 AND 4.9 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY).------- DEPENDENCY ON ALCOHOL IS EXHIBITED BY THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: CRAVING ALCOHOL;- AN INABILITY TO STOP DRINKING ONCE ONE HAS STARTED; A PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE, AS- EVIDENCED BY WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED ONCE DRINKING IS STOPPED, AND A- HIGH TOLERANCE FOR THE SUBSTANCE.------------- THOSE WHO ABUSE ALCOHOL ARE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CATEGORY, INCLUDING THOSE WHO- ARE DEPENDENT ON IT, AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE PRODUCED THE EFFECTS I- DESCRIBED THAT WOULD RESULT IN THEM BEING DIAGNOSED WITH ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, BUT- WHO MAY DRINK TOO MUCH, TOO OFTEN, OR IN SITUATIONS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF- HARM.---------- WHAT ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH-EFFECTS OF-ALCOHOL ABUSE?----------- SCIENCE HAS PROVEN THAT THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY CAN- ADVERSELY AFFECT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, BOTH IN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO DRINKS,- AND THOSE AROUND THEM.------------------ ACCIDENTS-------------- -- ALCOHOL-RELATED MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES KILL SOMEONE EVERY- 30 MINUTES AND INJURE SOMEONE EVERY 2 MINUTES. 41% OF ALL TRAFFIC-RELATED DEATHS- ARE ALCOHOL RELATED. AMERICANS SELF-REPORT 120 MILLION EPISODES OF ALCOHOL- IMPAIRED DRIVING EACH YEAR----,-19 OF THOSE EPISODES RESULTED-IN DEATH IN------- WHILE WE-VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SINCE THE 1980'S IN REDUCING DRUNK- DRIVING, THE NUMBER OF ALCOHOL-RELATED FATALITIES IS AGAIN-TRENDING UPWARDS.------------ VIOLENCE-------------- -- PERPETRATORS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE ARE OFTEN USING-ALCOHOL OR-DRUGS- WHEN THEY LASH OUT AT THEIR VICTIMS.----------- INCREASE IN BIRTH DEFECTS-------------- -- ALCOHOL CAN HAVE-A NUMBER OF HARMFUL EFFECTS ON A- BABY: INCLUDING MENTAL RETARDATION, LEARNING AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.------------ CO-MORBITIES OF DEPRESSION, OTHER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS-------------- -- PEOPLE WHO USE OR--ABUSE ALCOHOL OFTEN SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION OR OTHER MENTAL ILLNESS. 37% OF THOSE- WHO ARE DEPENDENT UPON ALCOHOL HAVE A CO-OCCURING MENTAL DISORDER.----------- REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE: INABILITY TO MEET WORK, SCHOOL OR FAMILY--RESPONSIBILITIES-------------- -- MOST ADULTS-------------- -- ABOUT-------------- 75% -- WITH SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE OR ABUSE- ARE EMPLOYED FULL OR PART TIME. BUT THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL, AND- OFTEN LOSE WORK TIME TO ALCOHOL-RELATED ILLNESS.------------ DRINKING-RELATED MEDICAL CONDITIONS-------------- -- THOSE WHO ARE ALCOHOL-DEPENDENT RUN A- HIGHER RISK OF LIVER DISEASE, AND VARIOUS FORMS-OF CANCER, INCLUDING BREAST--CANCER. THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE INJURED BY FALLING.------------------ WE CAN ALL QUOTE- NUMBERS AND STATISTICS UNTIL WE-VE COMPLETELY LOST TRACK.------ BUT THOSE NUMBERS- SIGNIFY--- REAL LIVES---- AND REAL FAMILIES.------------ THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR SONS AND- DAUGHTERS, OUR NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.------ WE'VE GOT- TO DO WHAT WE CAN-------------- -- GOVERNMENT AND THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IN PARTNERSHIP-------------- -- TO---- RESTORE---- THOSE LIVES AND DREAMS, AND--- PREVENT---- THE TRAGEDY FROM- OCCURRING IN AS MANY LIVES AND FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE.------- THE PROBLEM OF ALCOHOL ABUSE AND/OR ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY IS- PARTICULARLY TROUBLING IN YOUNG PEOPLE.--------------- TEENAGERS USE ALCOHOL MORE FREQUENTLY AND HEAVILY THAN ALL- OTHER DRUGS COMBINED.------ AND IT STARTS EARLY.------ 41% OF--- NINTH GRADERS---- REPORT- DRINKING IN THE LAST MONTH.-------------- AND 42% OF TENTH GRADERS REPORT HAVING BEEN--- DRUNK---- AT- LEAST ONCE. THEY VIEW IT AS A RITE OF PASSAGE.------ WE-VE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW- DRINKING EXCESSIVELY IS NOT A RITE OF PASSAGE.-------- ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY NIH'S NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON- ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM, KIDS WHO DRINK ARE MORE-LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF -VIOLENT CRIME, TO-BE INVOLVED IN ALCOHOL-RELATED TRAFFIC CRASHES, AND TO HAVE- SERIOUS SCHOOL-RELATED PROBLEMS.-------------- TRAGICALLY, THERE IS ALSO A STRONG LINK BETWEEN ALCOHOL USE- AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.-------------------OF CHILDREN WHO BEGIN USING ALCOHOL BEFORE AGE 13 WILL- EVENTUALLY BECOME ALCOHOLICS.-------------- THAT IS NOT A LEGACY I WANT FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN-OR THEIR- CHILDREN.------ IN AMERICA, WE WANT THE BEST FOR OUR KIDS.------ WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE- BEST THERE IS-------------- -- THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES, THE BEST EDUCATION, THE GREATEST- HAPPINESS.--------------- WE WANT THEM TO BE BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE.------ AS THE FATHER- OF FOUR, I FEEL THIS WITH MY WHOLE HEART, MY VERY BEING.-------------- MY PARENTS BOTH STRUGGLED- WITH ALCOHOL.------ THOSE ADDICTIONS CAUSED OUR FAMILY SUFFERING, HARDSHIP AND- DECEPTION.------ EACH AND EVERY FAMILY TOUCHED BY ADDICTION, KNOWS THE HEARTBREAK OF- BROKEN DREAMS.-------------- DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ARE THIEVES,-AND LIARS.-------THEY-STEAL THEIR- VICTIMS' SPIRITS.-------FEW AMERICAN FAMILIES-ARE IMMUNE.-------I WOULD VENTURE A GUESS- THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HAS FALLEN VICTIM TO ALCOHOL- DEPENDENCY OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.------- P---REVENTION------------------ -- STOPPING DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE BEFORE- THEY START-------------- -- IS THE BEST STRATEGY FOR REDUCING THE TRAGIC PUBLIC AND INDIVIDUAL- HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THEY BRING ABOUT.--------- I LIKE TO TELL AUDIENCES THAT I AM A-'RECOVERING SURGEON.'------- TWO OR THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CASES I CARED FOR AS A TRAUMA SURGEON IN ARIZONA- ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT-------------- -- FALLS, CAR ACCIDENTS, SHOOTINGS, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - WERE- PREVENTABLE.---------------------WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH FOR A VICTIM ONCE HE OR SHE IS IN- THE EMERGENCY ROOM.------ WE NEED TO DO MORE TO-PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING THERE IN- THE FIRST PLACE.------ WE-VE GOT TO REACH PEOPLE EARLY, IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND EVEN- BEFORE.------- WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH NOMINATED ME TO BE- SURGEON GENERAL, HE ASKED ME TO SPEAK REGULARLY TO THE NATION, PARTICULARLY- STUDENTS, ABOUT ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE, AND THE TREMENDOUS TOLL THEY TAKE ON OUR- SOCIETY.-------- AND THAT'S WHAT I- AM DOING.------ LAST YEAR I STARTED MY--- 50 SCHOOLS IN 50 STATES---- INITIATIVE TO- VISIT AT LEAST ONE SCHOOL IN EACH-OF THE 50 STATES, WASHINGTON, D.C. AND PUERTO- RICO DURING MY TENURE AS SURGEON GENERAL.-------------- I TELL THE KIDS MY OWN STORY OF OVERCOMING HARDSHIP IN A- POOR FAMILY WHERE THERE WAS-ALCOHOLISM.--------------------- BECAUSE ALCOHOL ADDICTION- IS SUCH A-COMPLEX AND PERVASIVE HEALTH ISSUE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR- PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO ADDRESSING IT.-------------- SUCH AN APPROACH MUST- INCLUDE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS IN THE AREAS OF PREVENTION, AS I'VE MENTIONED, AND- EDUCATION, EARLY INTERVENTION, TREATMENT, AND RESEARCH.------- MANY AGENCIES AT HHS ARE- DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM, INCLUDING SAMHSA, CDC, NIH, AND NIAAA.-------- WE FUND TREATMENT- PROGRAMS FOR THE ADDICTED, CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AMONG- VARIOUS POPULATIONS, AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN- DO TO GET HELP IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM, OR SOMEONE THEY LOVE HAS A PROBLEM.--------- BUT GOVERNMENT, ALONE,- CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.------ WE NEED THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.------ THE- PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT-------------- -- HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM ALL SETTINGS-------------- -- CAN ALL PLAY A- ROLE IN FIGHTING THIS PERVASIVE PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM.--------- CERTAINLY, LABORATORY- ALCOHOL SCREENING IS A GOOD EARLY INTERVENTION TOOL IN MANY SETTINGS.-------- IN THE EVENT THERE ARE- NOT THE FUNDS FOR THIS TYPE OF SCREENING, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS STILL HAVE THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SCREEN BY--- ASKING---- ABOUT ALCOHOL USE;--- ASSESSING---- THE- LEVEL OF SEVERITY,--- ADVISING---- AND--- ASSISTING----, AND--- ARRANGING----- FOR FOLLOW-UP.-------- THIS CAN BE DONE BY- PEDIATRICIANS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PSYCHOLOGIST, AND SOCIAL WORKERS-------------- -- ANYONE- WHO PROVIDES SERVICES TO A PERSON AT RISK FOR ALCOHOL ABUSE, WHICH, AS WE KNOW,- IS NEARLY EVERYONE.-------- AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE- HEALTH PRACTITIONERS HAVE THE POWER TO INTERVENE AND PREVENT VIRTUALLY EVERY- TIME WE-SEE A PATIENT.------ AND WE CAN HELP CLOSE THE HEALTH LITERACY GAP-------------- -- THE- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND WHAT OUR PATIENTS- UNDERSTAND-------------- -- IN EVERY VISIT.-------- A TEENAGER MIGHT NOT KNOW- HE'S AT RISK FOR ALCOHOLISM; HE THINKS IT'S COOL TO DRINK.-------- A PREGNANT WOMAN MIGHT- THINK IT'S OK TO HAVE THE OCCASIONAL GLASS OF WINE, UNAWARE THAT EVEN SMALL- AMOUNTS CAN CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS.-------- AND THE ELDERLY MAY NOT- KNOW THEY ARE AT GREATER RISK FOR FRACTURES WITH EACH AND EVERY DRINK THEY- TAKE.------ WE CAN HELP EQUIP THEM TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS.-------- THOSE OF US IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS HAVE AN ADDITIONAL- RESPONSIBILITY.------ THE DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FUTURE- COURSE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY IN THIS COUNTRY.--------------- MANY OF YOU ALREADY HAVE PROGRAMS WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS- TO FIGHT ALCOHOL ABUSE AND DEPENDENCY, AND THAT'S GREAT.------ KEEP THINKING, AND- STRIVING.--------------- IT'S TOO EASY TO GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION TO VIEW ALCOHOL- ABUSE AS 'ROUTINE,' AS AN 'OLD PROBLEM.'-------- CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT-GET- HIGHER BILLING IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND ON TELEVISION.--------------- BUT ALCOHOL ABUSE AND DEPENDENCY ARE STILL SERIOUS PUBLIC- HEALTH PROBLEMS IN AMERICA THAT REQUIRE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO FIGHT.--------------------- THANK YOU.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
