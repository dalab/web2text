VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION ON---------------------- 666  BY---------------------------------------------------- RAGNAR REDBEARD------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FROM:----- "RAGNAR REDBEARD------------------"  IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IN THIS NEWSGROUP (ALT.CHRISTIANITY) IN RESPONSE TO MY--- QUESTION REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF 666 THAT THE NUMBER 666 HAS ITS ROOTS IN NUMEROLOGY.--- THIS IS THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT AGREE WITH. THE NUMBER 666 HAS ITS ORIGINS--- IN ANCIENT NUMEROLOGY / ASTROLOGY, AND-IS CONNECTED TO WHAT-ARE CALLED----- "MAGIC--- SQUARES-----". THE ANCIENTS DEVISED A SCHEME OF NUMBERS ARRANGED IN SQUARES AND ORDERED--- IN SUCH A WAY THAT BY ADDING EACH ROW AND COLUMN, ONE WOULD REACH THE SAME TOTAL--- EACH TIME. 666 COMES FROM THE SQUARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUN, WHICH IS MADE--- UP OF EVERY NUMBER FROM 1 TO---- THE SUM OF ALL NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 36 IS OF COURSE,-------- SURROUNDING THE SUN-SQUARE ARE THE 12 DIVISIBLES OF---- WHICH ARE ATTACHED ---TO THE 12 SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.------  666 = PISCES-----  333 = AQUARIUS-----  222 = CAPRICORN-----  111 = SAGITAURUS-----  74 = SCORPIO-----  37 = LIBRA-----  18 = VIRGO-----  9 = LEO-----  6 = CANCER-----  3 = GEMINI-----  2 = TAURUS-----  1 = ARIES------  HERE IS WHAT THE-SUN SQUARE LOOKS LIKE:-------------------------------------  6 32 3 34 35 1  7 11 27 28 8 30  19 14 16 15 23 24  18 20 22 21 17 13  25 29 10 9 26 12  36 5 33 4 2 31  THE FACTORS OF 666 ARE 666, 3--, 222, 111,-74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3,--, AND--- THEY--- ARE ATTACHED TO THE ZODIAC-SIGNS AS FOLLOWS:-------  SO, EACH OF THE SIX ROWS HAS A TOTAL OF 111 (6 ROWS X 111 = 666). EACH-OF--- THE 6 COLUMNS ALSO HAS A TOTAL OF-----------  THE SUN SQUARE CONTAINS 9 SQUARES AND RECTANGLES WHOSE CORNERS TOTAL 74 (--- 9 X 74 = 666 ) ONE EXAMPLE IS---------------- "6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74"  FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICED NUMEROLOGY / ASTROLOGY, THE NUMBERS 666-AND 74 WERE--- CONSIDERED '----HOLY'---- NUMBERS, ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUN, WHICH THEY REVERED. NUMEROLOGY--- / ASTROLOGY (FROM NOW ON REFERRED TO AS HERMETICA) ALSO BECAME A-RECURRING PHENOMENON----IN THE BIBLE, PARTICULARELY THE KJV. MANY OF THE NUMBERS WHICH ARE SACRED TO--- HERMETICA ARE FOUND TO BE RECURRING THROUGHOUT THE KJV, 666 BEING THE MOST-OBVIOUS.------  THE FAMOUS REFERENCE TO-666 IS FOUND IN REVELATION, BUT ANOTHER EXISTS IN--- 1 KINGS 10:14 WHERE SOLOMON-TAKES 666 TALENTS OF GOLD-FROM NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS.--- SOLOMON IS ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT EXAMPLES OF THIS BIBLICALLY CODED WISDOM.------  SOLOMON IS BASICALLY THE FIGURE HEAD OF THE 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL DURING HIS--- REIGN AS KING. SOLOMON REPRESENTS THE SUN AND THE SUN SQUARE AND THE ---TRIBES--- OF ISRAEL ARE THE 12 SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC. THE---6 CLUE FOUND IN 1 KINGS IS ONE--- HINT - ANOTHER IS THE NAME SOLOMON.----- "SOL-----" IS THE LATIN WORD FOR THE SUN,----- "OM--------" IS THE HINDI WORD FOR THE SUN, AND ------ON-----" IS THE EGYPTIAN WORD FOR THE SUN.------  WHILE 666 IS THE MOST FAMOUS REFERENCE TO THE PRACTICE OF NUMEROLOGY FOUND--- IN THE BIBLE, THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE MORE SUBTLE. FIRST A QUICK POINT--- REGARDING HISTORY:------  IN APPROXIMATELY 325 A.D. EMPEROR CONSTANTINE-DECLARED CHRISTIANITY TO BE THE--- OFFICIAL RELIGION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. HIS REASONS ARE THE TOPIC OF ANOTHER--- DISCUSSION, BUT FOR BETTER OR WORSE IT IS A FACT.-FOR THE NEXT 1500 YEARS, ALL--- OTHER RELIGIONS OR PHILOSOPHIES WERE RUTHLESSLY PURGED FROM THE ROMAN EMPIRE,----TO THE POINT OF-KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ANCIENT RELIGIONS BECOMING EXTINCT. THE ANCIENTS,--- REALIZING THAT PRACTICING HERMETICA (NUMEROLOGY / ASTROLOGY) MEANT A VISIT TO--- THE TORTURE CHAMBER, DID WHAT ANYONE IN THEIR POSITION WOULD DO - THEY HID THEIR----KNOWLEDGE. THE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE-FACT THAT THEY WERE PRACTICALLY THE ONLY ---ONES WITH ANY SORT OF EDUCATION, AND THUS WERE TRUSTED TO READ, WRITE, AND INTERPRET--- FOR ROME. FAST FORWARD TO SOMEWHERE IN THE 1600'----S WHEN KING JAMES DECIDED THAT--- THE BIBLE SHOULD BE-AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH-AND-COMMISSIONED A GROUP-OF SCHOLARS--- INCLUDING FRANCIS BACON--TO OVERSEE THE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE FROM HEBREW--- & LATIN TO ENGLISH. FRANCIS BACON WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHAIN OF MINDS THAT--- SPRANG FROM-THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS AND HE CONSTRUCTED THE KJV IN SUCH A WAY--- THAT THE KNOWLEDGE THEY POSSESSED MAY BE PRESERVED. ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS DECIPHER--- IT.------  NOW, WITH THAT IN MIND, WE CAN LOOK AT THE BIBLE AND UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS ARRANGED--- THE WAY IT IS. IF SOMEONE WAS TO WRITE A CODE WITHOUT LEAVING ANY SORT OF DECODING--- MANUAL, IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE MEANS OF DECODING HIS WORK WOULD HAVE TO--- BE INCLUDED IN HIS WORK. THE FIRST STEP TO DECIPHERING THIS CODE WOULD BE TO--- LOOK FOR EXTREMES. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE, PSALM----- IT SITS AT THE EXACT CENTER----OF THE BIBLE (IN TRADITIONAL ORDER) AND IS THE SHORTEST CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE.--- AS SUCH, IT ALMOST JUMPS-OUT AND SCREAMS----- "HEY, LOOK AT ME-----!" PSALMS 117 HAS EXACTLY--- 33 WORDS. BY NO COINCIDENCE THERE ARE 33 YEARS IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST, AND--- 33 GENERATIONS FROM ADAM TO DAVID.------  *THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS FRANCIS BACON WHO WROTE THE WORKS--- ATTRIBUTED TO SHAKESPEARE. HERE IS A LITTLE TIDBIT SUGGESTIVE OF THIS THEORY.--- COUNT 666 CHAPTERS BACKWARDS FROM THE END OF THE BIBLE. YOU WILL FIND THAT IT--- IS PSALM---- COUNT 46 WORDS INTO THAT CHAPTER AND FIND THAT THE 46TH WORD IS-------- "SHAKE-----". COUNT 46 WORDS BACKWARDS FROM THE END OF-THAT CHAPTER AND FIND THAT--- THE 46TH WORD IS----- "SPEAR-----". THE MATHEMATICAL LAWS OF PROBABILITY ELIMINATE THE ---------COINCIDENCE-------THEORY, AND WE CONCLUDE THAT WITH THIS METHOD OF----- "COUNTING THE--- BIBLE-----" RATHER THAN READING-THE BIBLE WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.------  DUE TO A PERIOD OF OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS IN WHICH ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHURCH--- APPROVED-SUBJECT MATTER WAS RELENTLESSLY PURGED, INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF-PRE-CHRISTIAN--- RELIGIOUS PRACTICES-(PARTICULARELY THOSE RELATED TO NUMEROLOGY) IS SCARCE. SOME--- RUDIMENTARY INFORMATION STILL REMAINS, SUCH AS THE NAMES AND FABLES ASSOCIATED--- WITH THE PAGAN LORE, ALONG WITH SOME FUNDAMENTAL NUMEROLOGY / ASTROLOGY CONCEPTS.--- MANY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE TALES OF THOR, ODIN-(WOTAN, WODEN), ZUES, AND THE--- WHOLE PANTHEON OF GODS AND GODDESSES. THE HOROSCOPIC INFORMATION THAT EXISTS--- IN TODAY'----S NEW AGE CIRCLES CONSISTS MAINLY OF SIMPLE CLAIRVOYANCE AND----- "LOVE--- SPELLS-----". MANY NEW AGE OCCULTISTS USE THE PRINCIPLES OF GEMATRIA AND SUCH TO--- DISCOVER----- "THEIR-----" NUMBER, AND SO ON.------  ANCIENT '----MAGICIANS'---- USED 7 UNIQUE NUMBER SQUARES AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR WISDOM.--- EACH SQUARE WAS ARRANGED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL OF ANY COLUMN OR ROW WAS--- THE SAME. EACH OF THE SEVEN '----MAGIC'---- SQUARES WAS ALSO ASSIGNED A PLANETARY VALUE.--- MERCURY, VENUS, MARS, SATURN, JUPITER, THE MOON, AND THE SUN, ARE ALL ASSOCIATED--- WITH A SPECIFIC SQUARE. IT IS THE SUN SQUARE THAT IS MOST RELEVENT TO BIBLE--- CODING. THE SUN SQUARE IS THE 4TH OF THE 7 MAGIC SQUARES AND CONSISTS OF EVERY--- NUMBER FROM 1 TO 36, ARRANGED IN SIX ROWS AND SIX COLUMNS. EACH OF THE SIX ROWS--- ADDS UP TO 111 AND EACH OF THE SIX COLUMNS ADDS TO----- IT IS FROM THE MAGIC--- SQUARE OF THE SUN THAT THE INFAMOUS NUMBER 666 ORIGINATES. 6 COLUMNS X-------- 111 = 6 ROWS X----- 111 = ALL OF THE NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 36 TOTAL----- THERE ARE--- A TOTAL OF 3 SQUARES AND 6 RECTANGLES-WITHIN THE SUN SQUARE, EACH OF WHICH ADDS--- TO 74, AND ARE LISTED-BELOW.-- RECTANGLES & SQUARES X----------------------------------------------------------------- 74 =  6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74  11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74  16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74  7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74  19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74  32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74  3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74  14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74  27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74  THE NUMBERS TO KEEP TRACK OF HERE ARE 9, 74, AND 666, AS THEY WILL TURN UP ---ELSEWHERE LATER.------  VERY POSSIBLY, THE OTHER SQUARES CONTAIN NUMBER PATTERNS THAT CAN BE FOUND--- IN THE BIBLE, BUT OUR FOCUS WILL REMAIN WITH THE SUN SQUARE. THE NUMBER--- 666 HAS 12 DIVISIBLES, AND THESE DIVISIBLES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 12 SIGNS OF--- THE ZODIAC. THE SUN SQUARE AND ITS 12 DIVISIBLES (OR 12 SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC)--- SERVE TO FORM A THEME WHICH WAS TO BECOME COMMON IN MANY LATER RELIGIONS. ODIN--- HAD 12 CHIEF PRIESTS, SOLOMON HAD 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL, AND JESUS HAD 12 DISCIPLES.--- THE 1 + 12 PHENOMENON IS FOUND IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL. IN U.S. COURTS, THERE--- IS A JUDGE, AND TWELVE JURORS. ANGLO-SAXON FOLKLORE TELLS OF KING ARTHUR AND--- TWELVE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. UPON REFLECTION THIS SHOULD BE AN OBVIOUS--- ANALOGUE AS KING ARTHUR AND THE ROUND TABLE REPRESENT THE SUN AND THE SUN SQUARE,--- AND THE 12 KNIGHTS REPRESENT THE 12 SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.------  IT-SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT-THE-CHANCES OF THESE RELIGIONS AND FOLKLORE SHARING--- THE 1 + 12 THEME BEING A COINCIDENCE IS GRADUALLY FALLING. FURTHERMORE, SINCE--- THE 1 + 12 THEME APPEARS PRIMARILY IN WESTERN RELIGIONS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THEY--- ORIGINATE FROM ONE SOURCE. THIS SOURCE HAS BEEN GIVEN MANY NAMES THROUGHOUT--- THE CENTURIES AND USUALLY TAKES THE FORM OF SECRET SOCIETIES. AT ONE POINT IT----WAS DISCOVERED-THAT CERTAIN SOUNDS AFFECTED THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND, AND IT-WAS--- LONG KNOWN THAT THE HUMAN ANIMAL IS A HERD ANIMAL. PERCEPTIVE PEOPLE REALIZED--- THAT THE TWO SHOULD BE MIXED VERY CAREFULLY. SOME SOUND ARRANGEMENTS HAD A SOOTHING--- EFFECT, WHILE SOME HAD AN ANGERING EFFECT, OR A SADDENING EFFECT. ANCIENT TEMPLES--- WERE OFTEN CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SONGS SUNG DURING SERVICES WOULD--- HAVE A MAXIMUM EFFECT ON THE MASS. CERTAIN NOTES CAN SHATTER GLASS, OR RENDER--- HUMANS UNCONCIOUS, AND IT WAS THIS POWER THAT THESE SOCIETIES INTENDED TO CONCEAL.--- UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE COULD EASILY USE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO THE DETRIMENT OF SOCIETY.--- WHEN LANGUAGES WERE CONSTRUCTED,-THEIR VOWELS AND CONSONANTS WERE ASSIGNED NUMERICAL--- VALUES. THE STUDY OF THIS ALPHABETIC / NUMERICAL ASSOCIATION IS CALLED GEMATRIA,--- AND GEMATRIA IS USED TO ASSIGN NUMBERS TO SOUNDS (WORDS, PHRASES, ETC.).------  DEITIES, OR IMPORTANT FIGURES IN MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION ARE CONSTRUCTED IN----ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED ABOVE. ENGLISH GEMATRIA ASSIGNS THE--- VALUE OF---------- "1" TO THE LETTER----- "A-----", AND---------- "2" TO THE LETTER----- "B-----", ETC. WITH THIS IN--- MIND, LOOK AT THE WORD----- "JESUS-----":------  J E S U S--------10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 1--------------LET IT ALSO BE KNOWN THAT THE WORD JESUS IN GREEK ADDS TO---------- "888" IN GREEK GEMATRIA.--- GREEK GEMATRIA INCREASES BY A FACTOR OF 10 EACH 8 CHARACTERS, AND THE 24TH CHARACTHER--- HAS A VALUE OF----- JESUS IS REFERRED TO AS BEING THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID THROUGHOUT--- THE BIBLE, AND THAT REFERRENCE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF--- JESUS CAN BE FOUND IN THE MARS SQUARE. IF THE STAR OF DAVID IS DRAWN IN THE--- MARS SQUARE, AND THE NUMBERS IN THE MARS SQUARE-ARE REDUCED TO SINGLE DIGITS,--- WE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING PHENOMENON:-------------------------------------  2 6 7 2 3  4 3 7 8 7  8 5 4 3 9  1 9 1 5 4  5 6 1 2 6  AFTER DRAWING THE STAR OF DAVID INSIDE THIS SQUARE, WE SEE THAT THE POINTS--- ON THE TWO TRIANGLES COLLECT THE NUMBERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH TRIANGLE HAS--- A VALUE OF----- THE FIRST TRIANGLE HAS THE TIP AT THE NUMBER '7'-------- IN THE FIRST--- ROW, AND ITS TWO BASE POINTS SIT AT 4 AND 1, IF WE TRAVEL CLOCKWISE. THE INVERTED--- TRIANGLE HAS ITS UPPER RIGHT POINT AT THE 7 IN THE LAST COLUMN, AND TRAVELS--- ACROSS THE COLUMN TO ARRIVE AT THE 4 IN THE FIRST COLUMN, AND FINALLY THE--- 1 AT THE TIP. INSIDE THE HEXAGRAM THAT THE CENTER OF THE STAR FORMS, WE SEE THE--- NUMBER 741 TRAVEL DOWN THE VERTICAL AXIS AND THE NUMBER 543 TRAVEL ACROSS THE--- HORIZONTAL AXIS. 741 + 147 = 888 AND----- 543 + 345 = THIS IS WHY JESUS IS REFERRED--- TO AS A BRANCH OF DAVID.------  NOTE THAT THE WORD----- "JOSHUA-----" ADDS TO---------- "74" IN THE SAME WAY JESUS DOES, AND INCIDENTALLY--- SO DOES THE WORD----- "OCCULT-----".------  EVEN THOUGH IT IS THOUGHT TO BE COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT A MAN NAMED----- "SHAKESPEARE--------" WROTE THE COLLECTION OF CLASSIC PLAYS, AN INTERESTING '----COINCIDENCE'---- IS FOUND--- BY EMPLOYING THE CODING CONCEPTS USED BY FRANCIS BACON (WHO SUPERVISED THE WRITING--- OF THE KJV). IF WE COUNT 666 CHAPTERS BACKWARDS FROM THE END OF THE BIBLE, WE--- ARRIVE AT PSALM---- EXCLUDING THE MYSTERIOUS WORD----- "SELAH-----" (WHICH APPEARS--- 74 TIMES THROUGHOUT THE KJV) WE COUNT 46 WORDS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER--- AND FIND THE 46TH WORD TO BE----- "SHAKE-----". THE 46TH WORD FROM THE END OF THE CHAPTER--- IS----- "SPEAR-----". THIS IS COINCIDENTAL TO THE THEORY HELD BY SOME THAT FRANCIS BACON--- WROTE THE WORKS ATTRIBUTED TO SHAKESPEARE------  WHEN CONSTRUCTING A CODE THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE DECIPHERED WITHOUT A '----DECODER'----S--- GUIDE'---- A CRYPTOGRAPHER WILL USE EXTREMES AS POINTERS TO SHOW US THE STRUCTURE--- OF THE CODE. TOOLS SUCH AS LONGEST, SHORTEST, AND REPETITION SERVE TO DRAW ATTENTION.--- IN KEEPING WITH THIS THEORY, WE NOTICE THAT THE SHORTEST CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE,--- PSALM 117, IS ALSO PLACED IN THE EXACT CENTER. IT CONTAINS EXACTLY 33 WORDS,--- WHICH BY NO COINCIDENCE IS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST, THE NUMBER--- OF GENERATIONS FROM ADAM TO DAVID, AND THE NUMBER-OF DEGREES IN FREEMASONRY.------  ON COUNTING SETS OF 33 CHAPTERS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BIBLE WE FIND THAT--- THE 9TH SET LANDS ON 1 KINGS--- 9 SETS OF 33 CHAPTERS BACKWARDS FROM PSALM 117,--- WE FIND THAT THE 9TH SET LANDS ON 1 KINGS--- THE CHAPTERS 1 KINGS 6 AND 1 KINGS--- 7 DETAIL THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOLOMON'----S TEMPLE. THE TEMPLE IS BEGUN IN 1 KINGS--- 6, AND CONSTRUCTION ENDS IN 1 KINGS---------  DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE WORD----- "TEMPLE-----" IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH PERFECTED MAN,--- AND WISDOM, A GREAT DEAL OF CODING CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE BIBLICAL CONCEPT--- OF SOLOMON. THE WORD----- "SOLOMON-----" SERVES A DUAL PURPOSE IN THE CODING OF THE BIBLE.--- THE WORD----- "SOL-----" IS LATIN FOR----- "SUN-----", THE WORD----- "OM-----" IS HINDI FOR----- "SUN-----" AND THE--- WORD----- "ON-----" IS EGYPTIAN FOR----- "SUN-----". ALSO, THE VOWEL----- "O-----" IS SYMMETRICALLY PLACED--- THROUGHOUT THE WORD 3 TIMES. NOTE THAT----- "O-----" IS THE 15TH LETTER IN THE ALPHABET:------  O O O-------------------  15 15 15  1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666  EVEN WHEN PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION SUCH AS THIS, THE CHRISTIANS WILL GROW--- STRONGER IN THEIR PROCLAIMATIONS THAT THE PRACTICE OF NUMEROLOGY IS-EVIL. SOMETIMES--- IT WILL BE SUGGESTED-THAT PERHAPS THIS CODING WAS DESIGNED BY THE DEVIL TO DISCREDIT--- THE '----TRUTH'---- OF CHRISTIANITY. NONETHELESS SOLOMON WAS DESIGNED TO CODE 666 AND--- THE SUN SQUARE, AND MAKES REFERENCES TO THE '----TEMPLE'----, ALL OF WHICH ARE CONCEPTS--- BORROWED FROM THE ANCIENT OCCULT.------  NOT UNLIKE THE 1 + 12 THEME, THE RECURRENCE OF THE NUMBER---------- "7" IN RELIGION AND--- MYTHOLOGY IS SIGNIFICANT. THE SEVEN SEALS OF REVELATION IS A REFERENCE TO THE--- 7 MAGIC SQUARES, AS ARE OTHER REFERENCES TO 7 IN THE BIBLE:------  SEVEN HORNS AND SEVEN EYES ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF-GOD (REV 5:6), SEVEN-LAMPS--- OF FIRE WHICH ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD (REV 4:5) ARE ALL REFERENCES TO THE--- 7 MAGIC SQUARES.------  SOMETIMES METHODS OTHER THAN GEMATRIA AND NUMEROLOGICAL CODING ARE USED, AND--- IN REVELATION 2:17 WE DISCOVER CODED IN THAT VERSE THE BELIEF SYSTEM HELD BY--- FRANCIS BACON AND THE INITIATES WHO WROTE THE KING JAMES BIBLE. REVELATION 2:17 ---READS-----------  "HE-THAT HATH AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT SAITH UNTO THE CHURCHES;--- TO HIM THAT OVERCOMETH WILL I GIVE TO EAT OF THE HIDDEN MANNA, AND WILL GIVE--- HIM A WHITE STONE, AND IN THE STONE A NEW NAME WRITTEN, WHICH NO MAN KNOWETH--- SAVING HE THAT RECEIVETH IT-----------"  IN THIS CASE, THE PASSAGE POINTS TO A NEW NAME WRITTEN IN '----A WHITE STONE'----.--- IF ONE WERE TO UNSCRAMBLE THE WORDS '----A WHITE STONE'---- WE WILL GET '----THEE IS WOTAN'----.--- REMEMBER WOTAN IS A DEITY IN THE PANTHEON KNOWN AS ASATRU, AND SOMETIMES GOES--- BY THE NAME '----WODEN'---- OR '----ODIN-----. THE ODDS ON THAT BEING A COINCIDENCE SIMPLY CANNOT--- BE FATHOMED.------  OTHER THAN THE PASSAGES TO BE UNSCRAMBLED (-----"A WHITE STONE----------" - "THEE IS WOTAN-----")--- AND THE SUBTLE-REFERENCES TO THE MAGIC SQUARES, MOST OF THE WORDS IN THE BIBLE--- ARE '----FILLER'----, WHICH SERVE NO REAL INTERPRETIVE PURPOSE. THE BIBLE IS SO FULL--- OF CONTRADICTIONS AND PURE NONSENSE THAT IT ONLY STANDS TO REASON THAT IT WAS--- NOT MEANT TO BE READ, BUT COUNTED. OTHER THEORIES-SUGGEST THAT THE KING JAMES--- BIBLE WAS WRITTEN AS A TIME-BOMB DESIGNED TO DESTROY CHRISTIANITY. OTHERS SUGGEST----THAT CHRISTIANITY IN GENERAL WAS DESIGNED TO DESTROY THE WEST, AND THAT THE--- KJV WAS DESIGNED TO WARN US AND WAS CODED TO PRESERVE ANCIENT WISDOM. BOTH THEORIES--- FIT THE FACTS OUTLINED ABOVE, BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE WHOLE STORY WILL EVER--- BE KNOWN.------  NOW THAT THE CODING SYSTEM HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, THE-DOMINOES WILL BEGIN TO--- FALL. GIVEN ENOUGH TIME, WE CAN NO DOUBT UNRAVEL ALL OF THE WISDOM ENCODED INTO--- THE KJV AND DISCOVER THE KNOWLEDGE KNOWN ONLY BY A FEW, AND PERSECUTED BY RELIGIOUS--- TYRANTS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THIS ESSAY OUTLINED A FEW POINTERS AND CODING--- PRINCIPLES AND THE READER IS ENCOURAGED TO DISCOVER MORE. REMEMBER, COUNT THE--- BIBLE, DON'----T READ IT------!
