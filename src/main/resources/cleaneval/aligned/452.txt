A TIME TRAVELER'S CHESS SET, THEN, HAS THREE VARIETIES OF CHESSMEN.-- IN THE STARTING POSITION - THE SAME STARTING POSITION AS FOR STANDARD CHESS - ALL CHESSMEN ARE "UNTRAVELED" IN TIME.- FOR EACH OF THESE CHESSMEN THERE SHOULD BE ON HAND, IN CASE NEED ARISES, A CORRESPONDING "TRAVELING" CHESSMAN.--WHEN A TRAVELING CHESSMAN APPEARS ON THE BOARD, THAT CHESSMAN SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD TO BE CURRENTLY TRAVELING BACKWARDS IN TIME.-- (IF WE COULD--- BE---- SUCH A CHESSMAN, STATIONED IN A SAFE SPOT ON THE CHESSBOARD, WE WOULD SEE ASTOUNDING SIGHTS.- WE WOULD SEE PAWNS MOVE BACKWARDS.- WE WOULD SEE CHESSMEN OCCASIONALLY SPRING INTO EXISTENCE ON SQUARES BEING VACATED BY OTHER CHESSMEN.- GAZING BEYOND THE PERIMETERS OF THE BOARD, WE COULD OBSERVE CHESS CLOCKS RUNNING BACKWARDS, PENS LEAPING INTO PLAYERS' HANDS, DOUGHNUTS-MIRACULOUSLY FORMING WHOLE, UNBITE BY UNBITE, FROM THE MOUTHS OF HUMANS.) -FOR EACH TRAVELING CHESSMAN THERE MUST BE BE A "TRAVELED" CHESSMAN.- TRAVELED CHESSMEN ARE GRIZZLED VETERANS; THEY HAVE MOVED BACKWARDS IN TIME AND ARE AGAIN MOVING FORWARD IN TIME.---- THE THREE VERSIONS - UNTRAVELED, TRAVELING, TRAVELED - ARE THREE STAGES IN A PERSONAL HISTORY.- EACH SUCH PERSONAL HISTORY IS FOLDED BACK THROUGH TIME IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALL THREE STAGES PLAY OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE BOARD.---- A TIME TRAVELER'S CHESS SET CAN EASILY-BE FABRICATED FROM-THREE STANDARD SETS AND SOME MODELER'S PAINT.- UNTRAVELED CHESSMENSMIGHTELOO UPRISTINE, TRAVELING CHESSMENUSTRANGE, TRAVELED CHESSM-NP--PER--NCE-------,--- THE------------------------ M-O---VE----------- TH----A---T-------- I--S OF----------- AN----------- EL--O---SION, THE TRAV--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ELED CHESSMAN HAS A RESTRICTION UPON HIS ABILITY TO CAPTURE, BUT FOR EVERY MOVE THEREAFTER- THE TRAVELED CHESSMAN MOVES EXACTLY LIKE A CHESSMAN OF STANDARD CHESS.---- THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF MOVES: THE EXPLOSION, THE NORMAL MOVE, AND THE ANNIHILATION.- THE PLAYER TO MOVE MAKES ONE MOVE OF- ONE OF THESE TYPES.- A PLAYER'S MOVE ONLY DIRECTLY AFFECTS CHESSMEN OF THE PLAYER'S ASSIGNED COLOR EXCEPT WHEN THE MOVE IS A NORMAL- MOVE THAT CAPTURES AN ENEMY PIECE OR AN EXPLOSION THAT CAPTURES AN ENEMY PIECE.-------- THE EXPLOSION----- AN EXPLOSION REQUIRES AN "EXPLOSION SQUARE".-- AN EXPLOSION SQUARE IS AN EMPTY SQUARE REACHABLE- IN NO MORE THAN THREE MOVES BY A FRIENDLY UNTRAVELED CHESSMAN OF THE PIECE-TYPE OF INTEREST.-- SUCH AN UNTRAVELED PIECE IS CALLED AN "EXPLOSION SUPPORT", AND THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT AFTER EACH EXPLOSION A PLAYER CAUSES, THERE-MUST BE AT LEAST ONE WAY TO PAIR PAST EXPLOSIONS WITH ASSOCIATED EXPLOSION SUPPORTS SUCH THAT NO TWO EXPLOSIONS ARE PAIRED WITH THE SAME EXPLOSION SUPPORT.- FOR INSTANCE, IF THE PLAYER TO MOVE- WISHES TO CAUSE A "ROOK EXPLOSION" AT A GIVEN SQUARE, THE GIVEN SQUARE MUST BE EMPTY AND THE PLAYER MUST HAVE AT LEAST- ONE UNTRAVELED ROOK (OR PAWN THAT COULD PROMOTE TO ROOK) ON THE BOARD WHICH, IN THE HYPOTHETICAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT- THE PLAYER WERE ALLOWED TO MAKE MOVES IN SUCCESSION, COULD REACH THE GIVEN SQUARE, AS UNTRAVELED ROOK, IN NO MORE THAN- THREE TOTAL MOVES.- (THESE HYPOTHETICAL MOVES COULD INCLUDE CAPTURES OF ENEMY CHESSMEN. SOME OF THE MOVES ALSO COULD BE OF- FRIENDLY CHESSMEN OTHER THAN THE ROOK, IN ORDER TO FREE LINES FOR THE ROOK.)- FURTHER,- AT LEAST ONE OF THESE EXPLOSION SUPPORTS-MUST NOT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY AN EARLIER EXPLOSION.---- THERE IS ONE FINAL REQUIREMENT FOR A SQUARE TO SERVE AS AN EXPLOSION SQUARE.- THIS REQUIREMENT- INTRODUCES THE TERM "RESONATOR".- A RESONATOR IS ANY UNTRAVELED CHESSMAN WHICH COULD- POSSIBLY ANNIHILATE WITH-AN EXISTING TRAVELING CHESSMAN.- (SEE THE DISCUSSION OF ANNIHILATION BELOW.)- THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT A TRAVELED CHESSMAN OF THE PIECE-TYPE OF INTEREST CAN MOVE FROM THE EXPLOSION SQUARE WITHOUT CAPTURING AN ENEMY TRAVELING CHESSMAN OR A RESONATOR.---- THE PLAYER TO MOVE CAUSES AN EXPLOSION BY PLACING TRAVELING AND TRAVELED CHESSMEN OF THE SAME- PIECE-TYPE ON A QUALIFIED EXPLOSION SQUARE AND THEN MAKING A LEGAL MOVE WITH THE TRAVELED CHESSMAN- WITHOUT CAPTURING A TRAVELING CHESSMAN OR A RESONATOR.-- WHEN THE EXPLOSION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED TWO NEW, FRIENDLY- CHESSMEN ARE ON THE BOARD.- A TRAVELING CHESSMAN HAS APPEARED ON THE- EXPLOSION SQUARE.- A TRAVELED CHESSMAN OF THE SAME PIECE-TYPE HAS APPEARED ONE LEGAL MOVE FROM THE EXPLOSION SQUARE.- THE- TRAVELED CHESSMAN MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CAPTURED AN ENEMY CHESSMAN BUT CERTAINLY HAS NOT CAPTURED EITHER A TRAVELING- CHESSMAN OR A- RESONATOR.- FOR THE NEW TRAVELING CHESSMAN THERE WILL BE AT LEAST ONE FRIENDLY RESONATOR OF THE SAME PIECE TYPE NO MORE THAN- THREE MOVES DISTANT.-------- THE NORMAL MOVE------ TRAVELING CHESSMEN MAY NOT MOVE, BUT UNTRAVELED AND TRAVELED CHESSMEN MAKE NORMAL MOVES EXACTLY- LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN STANDARD CHESS.- UNTRAVELED, TRAVELING, AND TRAVELED CHESSMEN MAY ALL BE CAPTURED AS IN STANDARD- CHESS.- IN NORMAL MOVES, TRAVELED CHESSMEN ARE NOT RESTRICTED FROM CAPTURING ENEMY TRAVELING CHESSMEN OR RESONATORS.- THAT- RESTRICTION ONLY APPLIES DURING AN EXPLOSION.-------- THE ANNIHILATION------ IN STANDARD CHESS, CHESSMEN ARE BLOCKED BY FRIENDLY CHESSMEN; A CHESSMAN MAY REPLACE AN ENEMY- BUT NOT A FRIEND.- THIS RULE LARGELY OBTAINS IN TIME TRAVELER'S CHESS ALSO, BUT THERE IS A SINGLE, VERY MAJOR EXCEPTION.-- IN TIME TRAVELER'S CHESS A TRAVELING CHESSMAN DOES NOT BLOCK A FRIENDLY RESONATOR OF THE SAME PIECE-TYPE.- A RESONATOR- ONE MOVE AWAY FROM AN- TRAVELING CHESSMAN OF THE SAME PIECE-TYPE MAY MOVE ONTO THE SQUARE OCCUPIED BY THE TRAVELING CHESSMAN.- WHEN THAT HAPPENS,- BOTH CHESSMEN- VANISH; BOTH LEAVE THE BOARD PERMANENTLY.- THIS EVENT IS AN ANNIHILATION.---- WE CAN NOW ROUND OUT OUR EXPOSITION OF THE RULES OF TIME TRAVELER'S CHESS BY DISCUSSING GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS, CHECKMATE,- WINNING, AND ODDS AND ENDS.-------- GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS----- THE GRAMMATICAL RULES REFLECT THE FACT THAT TRAVELING CHESSMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE- ANNIHILATED, THAT THE PLAYER UNDERTAKING AN EXPLOSION IS OBLIGED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.- AT ANY TIME THE POSITION OF A- PLAYER'S PIECES IS EITHER GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT OR GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT.- IF A PLAYER HAS CAUSED NO EXPLOSIONS,- HIS POSITION AUTOMATICALLY IS GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT.- IF A PLAYER HAS LOST A TRAVELING CHESSMAN TO ENEMY CAPTURE,- HIS POSITION AUTOMATICALLY IS GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT.- IF A PLAYER HAS CAUSED ONE OR MORE EXPLOSIONS BUT HAS NOT LOST- A TRAVELING CHESSMAN, HIS POSITION IS GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT IF AND ONLY IF THERE IS A THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY THAT EACH OF- HIS TRAVELING CHESSMEN ON THE BOARD CAN BE ANNIHILATED.- IT IS ILLEGAL FOR A PLAYER TO MAKE A MOVE THAT LEAVES- HIS POSITION GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT.- OTHERWISE IT IS LEGAL - AND-VERY DESIRABLE - FOR THE PLAYER TO FORCE HIS OPPONENT'S- POSITION INTO GRAMMATICAL INCORRECTNESS.-------- CHECKMATE----- A PLAYER WITH ONE OR MORE TRAVELING CHESSMEN IS SAID TO HAVE AN "UNRESOLVED" POSITION.- A PLAYER TO MOVE- IS IN CHECK IF AND ONLY IF HE IS UNDER ONE-MOVE THREAT OF HAVING NO-KING (OR ELSE OF HAVING BOTH AN UNTRAVELED KING AND A- TRAVELING KING BUT NO TRAVELED KING) AT THE SAME TIME THAT HIS OPPONENT HAS A RESOLVED POSITION.- IF THIS ONE-MOVE THREAT IS- UNANSWERABLE, THE PLAYER ALSO IS IN-CHECKMATE.-----THUS, A PLAYER MIGHT LOSE HIS KING WITHOUT EVER BEING PLACED IN CHECK!
