TO HEAD NEW INSTITUTE-------- STUDYING IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON SOCIETY-------------------------------------------------- BY-KATHLEEN O'TOOLE--------------------------------------------------- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY-------- CAREER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING-------- ON,-----" A SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED PROFESSOR STEPHEN-------- CHAFFEE ADMITS, WHEN ASKED-TO SUMMARIZE THE INTERNET'S-------- IMPACT ON SOCIETY.----- "THERE IS A LOT OF SPECULATION,---------TONS OF BOOKS AND PREDICTIONS, BUT-WHEN-YOU LOOK AT THE-------- EVIDENCE, IT'S VERY SKETCHY.--------------------------------------------------------" NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN,-------- CHAFFEE, A STANFORD PROFESSOR OF COMMUNICATION WHO HAS-------- BEEN TRACKING THE INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION ON POLITICS-------- OVER 35 YEARS AND IS STARTING TO PICK UP SIGNS OF-------- INTERNET INFLUENCE, WAS DELIGHTED TO LEARN RECENTLY THAT-------- AN ESTEEMED SOCIAL SCIENTIST, BUSINESS EXECUTIVE AND-------- WELL-PLACED HIGH-TECH ENTREPRENEUR WAS COMING TO CAMPUS-------- FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRACKING-------WHAT'S GOING ON.-------------" HE IS NORMAN NIE, FORMER CHAIR-OF THE UNIVERSITY OF --------CHICAGO'S POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT, LONGTIME STUDY-------- DIRECTOR OF THAT UNIVERSITY'S NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH-------- CENTER, AND CO-FOUNDER AND FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF-------- SPSS, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING SOFTWARE COMPANIES. NIE-------- HAS TRADED IN THOSE ROLES TO DIRECT A NEW RESEARCH-------- INSTITUTE, THE STANFORD INSTITUTE FOR THE QUANTITATIVE-------- STUDY OF SOCIETY (SIQSS). ITS CENTRAL MISSION IS TO APPLY-------- SURVEY RESEARCH DATA TO THE-ANALYSIS OF BROAD SOCIAL-------- CHANGES, ESPECIALLY THOSE PROMPTED BY INFORMATION-------- TECHNOLOGY-AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT.-------------------------------------------------------- "NORMAN IS SINCERE,-------- AND HE KNOWS-HOW TO DO THIS,-----" CHAFFEE SAYS.-------------------------------------------------------- "NORMAN IS A VERY-------- ENERGETIC RESEARCH ENTREPRENEUR,-----" ADDS ECONOMICS-------- PROFESSOR EMERITUS VICTOR FUCHS,----- "AND THAT'S GOOD-------- BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF HOW TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING OUR-------- SOCIETY IS A FASCINATING ONE. HE IS ALSO INTERESTED IN-------- THE ROLE OF EDUCATION, AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT-IT FROM ONE --------POINT OF VIEW, EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARE-------- NOT THAT FAR APART. WE OFTEN CONFUSE THE EDUCATION---------PROCESS WITH ITS PRODUCT, AND WE MAY BE DOING THE SAME-------- WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY.--------------------------------------------------------" COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION-------- TECHNOLOGY MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE-AS INFLUENTIAL AS-------- GUTENBERG'S PRESS, WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE NECESSITATED THE-------- CREATION OF NATION STATES AND MODERN WARFARE, SAYS-------- CHAFFEE. BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE ITS INFLUENCE WILL BE-------- MORE MODEST, SUCH AS THAT OF THE TELEGRAPH, WHICH, ALONG-------- WITH RAILROADS, BROUGHT US----- "A COUNTRY 3,000 MILES-------- WIDE THAT FUNCTIONS AS A SINGLE UNIT,-----" HE SAYS.------------- "ALL WE KNOW IS THAT EVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN-------- WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF A NEW COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY-------- THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF CONSEQUENCES AND THAT ADOPTION OF-------- THIS LATEST ONE IS COMING ON REALLY FAST.--------------------------------------------------------" SO FAST THAT NIE WORRIES-------- THE COUNTRY IS MISSING THE BOAT -- FAILING TO COLLECT-------- BASELINE DATA ON SOCIAL TRENDS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF-------- WIDESPREAD SPECULATION. WHO HASN'T HAD A CONVERSATION-------- LATELY ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING JOBS, FAMILY-------- LIFE, COMMUNITY, COMMERCE OR POLITICS?-------------------------------------------------------- "THERE IS CURRENTLY-------- NO STUDY GOING ON THAT IS CAPABLE OF TRACKING THE SOCIAL,-------- ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF [INFORMATION-------- TECHNOLOGY] OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE,-----" NIE SAID-------- RECENTLY BETWEEN BITES OF LEFTOVER CHEESE AND CRACKERS, A-------- MAKE-DO LUNCH ON A DAY CRAMMED WITH APPOINTMENTS.------------- "THERE JUST HASN'T BEEN THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF-------- FUNDRAISING, SCHOLARSHIP AND FOCUS. THAT'S WHAT I'VE COME-------- HERE TO DO, AND TO GET IF OFF THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS-------- POSSIBLE.--------------------------------------------------------" FOR NIE, STANFORD WAS A-------- LOGICAL LOCATION ONCE HE RESIGNED HIS OTHER POSTS. HE'S-------- AN ADMIRER OF PRESIDENT GERHARD CASPER, WHO WAS HIS-------- PROVOST AT CHICAGO; HIS INTELLECTUAL FRIENDSHIPS HERE-------- DATE BACK TO HIS GRADUATE STUDENT DAYS IN THE LATE 1960S;-------- THE CAMPUS IS-CLOSER TO HIS HOME IN SUN VALLEY, IDAHO,-------- THAN WAS CHICAGO; AND HIS ENCINA COMMONS OFFICE IS, OF-------- COURSE, IN THE HEART OF THE SILICON VALLEY, INFORMATION-------- TECHNOLOGY'S HOME BASE.----- "I THINK IT'S JUST-------- FASCINATING THAT WITH ALL THE MONEY GENERATED-BY THE IT --------INDUSTRY AND ALL THEIR BELIEF, IF YOU LISTEN TO THEIR-------- ADVERTISING, THAT THEY ARE REVOLUTIONIZING WORK AND-------- SOCIAL LIFE, THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SO FEW, IF ANY, QUALITY-------- STUDIES OF THESE PHENOMENA FUNDED BY THE HIGH-TECH-------- INDUSTRY,-----" HE SAYS.--------------------------------------------------- THE INDUSTRY OFTEN PAINTS---------A GLOWING PORTRAIT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CALLING THE-------- INTERNET IN PARTICULAR A TOOL FOR GREATER DEMOCRACY,-------- FREEDOM, SOCIAL CONNECTIVITY AND FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY.-------- PERHAPS THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T WANT STUDIES THAT MIGHT FIND-------- SOME HOLES IN THAT PICTURE, A REPORTER SUGGESTS TO NIE,-------- WHO IMMEDIATELY SHAKES HIS HEAD.-------------------------------------------------------- "THE GENTLEMEN WHO---------SIT OUT ON-SAND HILL ROAD AND THE FOUNDERS OF THE-------- COMPANIES THEY SPONSOR VERY MUCH SHOULD WANT TO KNOW THE-------- SOCIAL IMPACT OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING,-----" HE SAYS.-------- BESIDES, HE POINTS OUT, BAD RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL-BE-------- DONE ON A SHOESTRING AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF QUALITY-------- STUDIES, WILL UNDULY INFLUENCE PUBLIC OPINION.--------------------------------------------------- TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE-------- STUDY ON THE----- "INTERNET BLUES-----" THAT MADE-------- FRONT-PAGE HEADLINES IN LATE AUGUST. NIE GRIMACES AT THE-------- MERE MENTION OF THAT STUDY'S PRIMARY FINDING: TOO MUCH-------- INTERNET SURFING MAKES PEOPLE DEPRESSED.-------------------------------------------------------- "HERE'S-A STUDY THAT-------- STARTS WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE, FOLLOWS THEM FOR A FEW-------- MONTHS, MEASURES THEIR USE OF THE INTERNET AND THEIR-------- LEVEL OF DEPRESSION, AND SHOWS THAT AS THEIR INTERNET USE-------- INCREASES THEIR DEPRESSION INCREASES, AND THEY CONCLUDE-------- THAT THE CAUSAL ARROW GOES FROM INTERNET USAGE TO-------- DEPRESSION. NOW, WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT-------- DEPRESSED PEOPLE ALSO WATCH MORE TELEVISION THAN-------- NON-DEPRESSED PEOPLE?-I'D SIMPLY-SAY IT WAS INTERESTING,-------- BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU THE CAUSAL DIRECTION.--------------------------------------------------------" QUALITY STUDIES ARE BEING-------- CONDUCTED ON THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERS-IN THE WORKPLACE-------- AND ON FIRMS,-NIE SAYS. ------WHAT IS MISSING IS A --------SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY---------------------------------------------------------------------------- AFFECTS THE VERY CONCEPT-OF COLLEGIALITY AND INFORMAL-------- FACE-TO-FACE RELATIONS.-ONE OF THE-WAYS TO VIEW THIS-------- TECHNOLOGY IS AS A WONDERFUL COMMUNICATIONS AND CONSUMER-------- TOOL. ANOTHER WAY IS TO LOOK AT-IT AS THE LATEST STEP-IN---------THE LONG CHAIN OF THE CRISIS OF MODERNITY, WHICH IS A-------- SERIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT REMOVE PEOPLE-------- FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM THE SUPPORTING LIGATURES AND-------- INTERPERSONAL COMMUNITIES OF FIRST THE VILLAGE AND-------- NEIGHBORHOOD, THE EXTENDED FAMILY, THEN THE NUCLEAR-------- FAMILY, AND NOW THE BROKEN NUCLEAR FAMILY.--------------------------------------------------------" NIE'S INTEREST IN THESE-------- SUBJECTS DATES BACK TO HIS UNDERGRADUATE DAYS AT GEORGE-------- WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, WHERE HE WAS THE------------- "FAVORITE-----" STUDENT OF KEN PREWITT, TODAY'S U.S.-------- CENSUS DIRECTOR, RECALLS GABRIEL ALMOND, STANFORD-------- PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. PREWITT-------- RECOMMENDED HIM TO STANFORD FOR GRADUATE WORK, WHERE NIE-------- TURNED OUT TO BE----- "STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY-------- SOPHISTICATED AND WITH AN EARLY AMBITION TO SPECIALIZE IN-------- QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH,-----" ALMOND SAYS.-------------------------------------------------------- "I WAS ONE OF SID-------- VERBA'S RESEARCH ASSISTANTS HERE AT STANFORD,-----" NIE-------- REMINISCES,----- "AND WE WERE WORKING ON CITIZEN-------- PARTICIPATION. WE HAD THIS FLOOD OF DATA COMING IN FROM-------- HOUR-AND-A-HALF-LONG INTERVIEWS FROM EIGHT COUNTRIES OF-------- EVERY CONTINENT. . . . I KNEW THAT THE THEN-CURRENT-------- TABULATION EQUIPMENT -- COUNTER SORTERS AND PLUGBOARD-------- MACHINES -- WERE SIMPLY NOT UP TO IT.--------------------------------------------------------" SO NIE BUILT A------------- "BOXCAR INSIDE A SHOEBOX,-----" WRITING COMPUTER-------- CODE FOR A 7090 MAINFRAME OF THE MID-1960S THAT PERMITTED-------- THE RESEARCHERS TO MANIPULATE THEIR DATA WITH-------- SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. TODAY, THE-------- FOLLOW-ON DEVELOPMENT OF THAT CODE IS THE LEADING-------- RESEARCH TOOL FOR UNIVERSITY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AS WELL AS-------- MARKETING AND POLLING ORGANIZATIONS. BUT AS A STUDENT IN-----------68 AND FOR-YEARS-AFTERWARD,-NIE SAYS,----- "I HAD NO-------- IDEA THAT-IT WOULD BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. TIMING IN LIFE-------- IS A LOT OF THE STORY.--------------------------------------------------------" IF NIE HAS HIS WAY, THE-------- STANFORD INSTITUTE FOR THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF SOCIETY-------- WILL DRAW RESEARCHERS FROM ACROSS CAMPUS WHO WILL TURN-------- THOSE TOOLS LOOSE ON NEW DATA. HE WANTS THEM TO HAVE-------- ACCESS TO SYSTEMATIC SURVEYS OF RANDOM, REPRESENTATIVE-------- CROSS-SECTIONS OF-AMERICANS IN ORDER TO SEE EMERGING-------- PATTERNS. RAISING THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR ONGOING-------- SURVEYS IS ONE OF HIS PARAMOUNT TASKS AS DIRECTOR.-------- BESIDES FUCHS AND CHAFFEE, OTHER FACULTY WHO HAVE BECOME-------- INVOLVED IN THE INSTITUTE INCLUDE POLITICAL SCIENTISTS-------- DAVID BRADY, DOUG RIVERS, DAVID EPSTEIN AND SHANTO-------- IYENGAR, AND VISITING PROFESSOR SHARYN O'HALLORAN.-------------------------------------------------------- "WE ARE FUNDING SMALL-------- PROJECTS BY INDIVIDUAL-FACULTY MEMBERS WITH GRANTS OF-------- $5,000,-----" NIE SAYS, ADDING THAT HE SOON WILL ANNOUNCE-------- A PROGRAM OF $25,000 GRANTS FOR LARGER STUDIES OF SOCIAL-------- CHANGE.----- "THERE ARE NO GOOD ONE-MAN-BAND-------- INSTITUTES,-----" HE SAYS, EXPLAINING WHY THE INSTITUTE-------- IS ALSO HOSTING FACULTY SEMINARS AND A PUBLIC LECTURE-------- SERIES.--------------------------------------------------- NIE ALSO WANTS TO STUDY-------- THE IMPACT OF FORMAL SCHOOLING ON SOCIETY. HE IS AMONG A-------- GROWING NUMBER OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO QUESTION THE-------- REIGNING PARADIGM ABOUT THE EVER-INCREASING RETURNS TO-------- EDUCATION. EDUCATION, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, YEARS OF-------- SCHOOLING, HAS PROVED TO BE THE BEST PREDICTOR SOCIAL-------- SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE.---------------------------------------------------------------- "IF YOU READ THE-------- LITERATURE IN ALL THE SOCIAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINES ON-------- EDUCATION -- EDUCATION AND CITIZENSHIP, EDUCATION AND-------- EARNINGS, EDUCATION AND BELONGING -- YOU SEE ARGUMENTS-------- FOR A PREDOMINANTLY HUMAN CAPITAL MODEL OF EDUCATION'S-------- ROLE: THE MORE EDUCATION, THE BETTER,-----" HE SAYS.--------------------------------------------------- BUT YOU ALSO WILL SEE THAT-------- AS AUTHORS WORK WITH LATER 20TH CENTURY DATA IN-------- INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THEY INCREASINGLY MAKE-------- ARGUMENTS FOR EXCEPTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE PREMISE.------------- "THEY WILL SAY, 'WELL, INCOME WOULD HAVE CONTINUED-------- TO GO UP EXCEPT FOR THIS,' OR 'CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT WOULD-------- HAVE GONE UP EXCEPT FOR THE CONTRAVENING FORCES OF-------- TELEVISION OR THE DEATH OF POLITICAL PARTIES.' I THINK WE-------- HAVE RUSHED FAR TOO FAR WITH THIS NOTION THAT EDUCATION-------- PRODUCES BETTER CITIZENSHIP, MORE INCOME FOR EVERYBODY, A-------- BETTER OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURE, MORE ORGANIZATIONAL-------- ENGAGEMENT. ITS EFFECTS SEEM TO VARY FROM OUTCOME TO-------- OUTCOME ENORMOUSLY.--------------------------------------------------------" TAKE THE CONVENTIONAL-------- WISDOM THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE LEADS TO COMMUNITY INFLUENCE-------- AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, A SUBJECT THAT NIE AND TWO-------- CO-AUTHORS ADDRESSED IN THEIR PRIZE-WINNING 1996 BOOK,--- EDUCATION-------- AND DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP IN AMERICA.------------------------------------------------------------ "IF IT TOOK A B.A.-------- DEGREE 25 YEARS AGO TO GET YOU IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE-------- TOWN MEETING THROUGH YOUR OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OR YOUR-------- POSITION IN THE COMMUNITY AND YOUR INEVITABLE LEADERSHIP-------- IN ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS, WHAT DOES IT TAKE-------- TODAY?-----" NIE ASKS.----- "CERTAINLY, A B.A. PUTS YOU-------- NOWHERE NEAR THE FRONT OF THE ONGOING TOWN MEETING, AND-------- THAT SAYS TO ME THAT POWER AND-INFLUENCE IS NOT EASILY-------- EXPANDABLE. IT MAY TAKE LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND GREAT-------- SOCIAL INVENTION TO EXPAND THEM. I-MEAN, YOU CAN MULTIPLY-------- BY 1,000 THE NUMBER OF MESSAGES THAT CITIZENS SEND TO-------- THEIR GOVERNMENT, BUT YOU CAN'T MULTIPLY BY ANYTHING LIKE-------- 1,000 THE NUMBER-OF MESSAGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN --------RESPOND TO.--------------------------------------------------------" THERE ARE ALSO---------------ANOMALIES IN THE SYSTEM-----" THAT PURPORTS TO --------TELLS THE ECONOMIC STORY, HE SAYS.----- "WE-RANK LAST --------AMONG INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETIES IN TERMS OF THE-------- QUANTITATIVE KNOWLEDGE WE PRODUCE IN OUR COLLEGE AND HIGH-------- SCHOOL GRADUATES, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT THE SILICON VALLEY IS---------NOT IN GERMANY; IT'S RIGHT HERE.-----" ONE-POSSIBILITY,-------- NIE SAYS, IT THAT THE LATE HARVARD ECONOMIST FRED HIRSCH-------- WAS RIGHT WHEN HE OBSERVED THAT----- "MORE EDUCATION FOR-------- EVERYBODY LEAVES EVERYBODY IN THE SAME PLACE.-------------" SOMETIMES EDUCATION IS MORE OF A----- "SORTING-------- MACHINE-----" THAN A CREATOR OF HUMAN CAPITAL, HE SAYS,-------- BUT TO FIGURE OUT WHEN EDUCATION IS MOST WORTHWHILE-------- REQUIRES DATA THAT THE CENSUS AND OTHER NATIONAL-------- DATABASES DON'T GATHER,-SUCH AS WHERE-AMERICANS WENT TO-------- SCHOOL AND WHAT THEY MAJORED IN.--------------------------------------------------- NOT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN-------- THE INSTITUTE HAS THE SAME CONCERNS AS NIE, HE AND OTHERS-------- SAY, BUT THEY SEE VALUE IN THE JOINT ENTERPRISE.------------- "THE SOCIAL SCIENCES HAVE TAKEN THE ROAD TO-------- BALKANIZATION ABOUT AS FAR AS IT CAN GO,-----" NIE SAYS.------------- "I COUNT EVERY DAY WHEN I GO INTO ONE OF THESE-------- SEMINARS OR MEETINGS HOW MANY DISCIPLINES WE'VE MANAGED-------- TO BRING OUT.--------------------------------------------------------" WHATEVER THE-OUTCOME OF-------- THESE LONG-RANGE STUDIES, IT'S EVIDENT THAT STANFORD IS-------- THE RIGHT PLACE FOR NIE, SINCE HIS LIFE IS INEXTRICABLY-------- LINKED BOTH TO EDUCATION AND THE STUDY OF INFORMATION-------- TECHNOLOGY. CAUGHT IN PALO ALTO PRE-LUNCH TRAFFIC ON THE-------- DAY HE WAS INTERVIEWED FOR THIS STORY, HE USED HIS CELL-------- PHONE SEVERAL TIMES TO ESCAPE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISSED-------- APPOINTMENTS, AND HE SYNCED HIS PERSONAL DIGITAL-------- ASSISTANT WITH HIS COMPUTER SO HE COULD CONTINUE TO-------- CONDUCT INSTITUTE BUSINESS FROM A REMOTE LOCATION -- A-------- HOSPITAL, WHERE HE PLANNED TO WELCOME HIS FIRST-------- GRANDCHILD IN PERSON. ------YOU CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT OF-------- THINGS ON THE NET,-----" HE EXPLAINED, BETWEEN SIPS OF-------- DIET COKE,----- "BUT YOU CAN'T LOOK SOMEONE IN THE EYE,-------- YOU CAN'T SHAKE THEIR HAND AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GIVE-------- THEM A HUG AND A KISS.-----" SR------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
