THOSE----------- MEASURES CULMINATED WITH THE ENACTMENT OF----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" LEGISLATION AROUND THE NATION. BEGINNING WITH WASHINGTON STATE IN 1993,----------- BY THE END OF THE DECADE,-THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OVER HALF OF ALL----------- STATES HAD ENACTED SOME FORM OF A----- "THREE STRIKES-----" LAW. ROUGHLY----------- CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THESE MEASURES, CRIME RATES HAVE DECLINED NATIONWIDE. -----------ADVOCATES OF SEVERE INCARCERATION POLICIES HAVE CLAIMED THAT----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" LAWS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DECLINE.-------------------------------------------------  NOWHERE IN THE NATION ARE THE STAKES HIGHER----------- THAN IN CALIFORNIA. CALLED----- "THE BIGGEST PENAL EXPERIMENT OF ITS----------- KIND IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY,-------DUE TO ITS-DISTINCTIVE PROVISIONS,----------- CALIFORNIA-S----- "THREE STRIKES-----" LAW ACCOUNTS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY----------- OF----- "THREE STRIKES-----" CASES NATIONWIDE. FRANKLIN E. ZIMRING,----------- GORDON------- HAWKINS, AND SAM------- KAMIN, PUNISHMENT AND DEMOCRACY:----------- THREE STRIKES AND YOU-RE OUT IN CALIFORNIA AT--2 (2001). ITS SENTENCE----------- ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDE NOT JUST THE WIDELY ADVERTISED TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR-TO-LIFE----------- TERMS FOR THIRD-STRIKE FELONS, BUT-ALSO A DOUBLING OF THE NOMINAL SENTENCE----------- FOR MANY SECOND-STRIKE OFFENDERS. FURTHER, ITS PROVISIONS INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL----------- BURGLARY AS A POSSIBLE QUALIFYING STRIKE. FINALLY, THE THIRD STRIKE,----------- TRIGGERING THE TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR-TO-LIFE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT, MAY BE----------- ANY FELONY. AS A RESULT, CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR OVER 90 PERCENT OF----------- ALL----- "THREE STRIKES-----" SENTENCES------- NATIONWIDE.------------------------------------------------------  "THREE STRIKES-----" ADVOCATES IN----------- CALIFORNIA POINT TO DRAMATIC DECLINES IN CRIME RATES SINCE ITS PASSAGE -----------AND CLAIM VICTORY. FOR-EXAMPLE, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL DAN LUNGREN-S----------- OFFICE REPORTED THAT----- "[S]INCE THE PASSAGE OF- THREE STRIKES,- .----------- . . THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IN CALIFORNIA HAS DROPPED 26.9 PERCENT WITH----------- A 30.8 PERCENT DROP IN THE SIX MAJOR CRIME CATEGORIES.-----" OFFICE----------- OF THE ATTORNEY GEN., CAL. DEP-T OF JUSTICE,----- "THREE STRIKES AND----------- YOU-RE OUT-ITS IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AFTER----------- FOUR YEARS 3 (1998).-----" SECRETARY OF STATE BILL JONES, WHO SPONSORED----------- THE----- "THREE STRIKES-----" LEGISLATION AS AN ASSEMBLYMAN, HAS SUGGESTED----------- THAT THREE STRIKES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THAT DROP----------- IN CRIME. JUSTICE JAMES------- ARDAIZ, WHO ASSISTED IN DRAFTING THE----------- ORIGINAL BILL, IS EVEN MORE EXPLICIT:----- "CRIME IN CALIFORNIA HAS----------- DECLINED DRAMATICALLY SINCE------ THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT----------- ARE MORE POLICE, TOUGHER LAWS, AND THREE STRIKES. . . . [W]HERE THERE----------- ARE A NUMBER OF EXPLANATIONS-FOR A GIVEN-RESULT, THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION----------- IS USUALLY CORRECT. THE THREE STRIKES LAW IS THAT EXPLANATION.----------------" JAMES A. ARDAIZ,--- CALIFORNIA-S THREE STRIKES LAW: HISTORY, EXPECTATIONS,----------- CONSEQUENCES----, 32 MCGEORGE L.-REV. 1, 35-----JONES POINTS TO ADDITIONAL -----------SUPPORT FOR THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF----- "THREE STRIKES-----": WHILE----------- CRIME RATES DECLINED-ACROSS THE NATION, THE DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA SIGNIFICANTLY----------- OUTSTRIPPED-THAT IN THE REST OF THE NATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER A SIX-MONTH----------- PERIOD IN 1995, CRIME DECLINED ONLY 1 PERCENT NATIONWIDE WHILE-IT DROPPED----------- 7 PERCENT IN CALIFORNIA. JONES,--- WHY THE THREE STRIKES LAW IS WORKING----------- IN CALIFORNIA----, 11 STAN. L.---- & POL-Y REV. 23, 24 (1999).-------------------------------------------------  WHILE COMMENTATORS DISAGREE ABOUT WHETHER------------THE LAW IS-THEORETICALLY JUSTIFIED, MUCH OF THE DEBATE FOCUSES ON EMPIRICAL----------- DATA. IF----- "THREE STRIKES-----" ACCOUNTS FOR THE DRAMATIC DECLINE----------- IN CRIME,-THEORETICAL OBJECTIONS, INCLUDING MORAL CONCERNS ABOUT ITS----------- FAIRNESS, ARE NOT LIKELY TO MOVE LEGISLATORS OR THE PUBLIC. AND AS INDICATED----------- ABOVE,----- "THREE STRIKES-----" SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT EMPIRICAL DATA----------- SUPPORT THEIR POSITION.--------------------------------------------------  HOWEVER, DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" SUPPORTERS, THE DATA ON WHICH THEY RELY-DO NOT WITHSTAND------------CLOSE SCRUTINY. MORE RECENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SUPPORTS MANY OF THE----------- CLAIMS OF----- "THREE STRIKES-----" CRITICS THAT THE LAW SIMPLY CANNOT----------- DELIVER ON ITS PROMISES AND INSOFAR AS IT MAY HAVE SOME MARGINAL DETERRENT----------- EFFECT, IT COMES AT TOO HIGH A COST.-------------------------------------------------  COMPARING CALIFORNIA-S DECLINE IN CRIME----------- WITH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, AS SECRETARY OF STATE JONES DOES WHEN HE----------- ASSERTS THAT----- "THREE STRIKES-----" ACCOUNTS FOR CALIFORNIA EXCEEDING----------- THE DECLINE IN CRIME NATIONWIDE, CUTS BOTH WAYS. NEW YORK, NOT CALIFORNIA,----------- SHOWED THE SHARPEST DECLINE IN CRIME DURING THE TIME IN QUESTION. WHILE----------- SOME OF NEW YORK-S POLICING POLICIES HAVE RAISED SERIOUS CIVIL RIGHTS----------- CONCERNS, IT WAS NOT ONE OF THE STATES THAT ADOPTED A----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" LAW DURING THE-1990S. HENCE, ITS DECLINE IN CRIME CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED----------- TO SUCH LEGISLATION.-------------------------------------------------  A NUMBER OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED STUDIES----------- ALSO RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT THE TRUE EFFECTIVENESS OF----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" LAWS IN LOWERING CALIFORNIA-S CRIME RATE. FOR-EXAMPLE, WITHIN CALIFORNIA,----------- COUNTIES THAT AGGRESSIVELY ENFORCE THE LAW----- "HAD NO GREATER DECLINES----------- IN CRIME THAN DID COUNTIES THAT USED IT FAR MORE SPARINGLY.-----" SEE-------------- CRIME STATES CAPTURE BOTH ARGUMENTS,---- CONTRA COSTA TIMES, FEB.----------- 27, 2000, AT A---ONE STUDY FOUND THAT CRIME DROPPED BY 21.3 PERCENT----------- IN THE SIX MOST LENIENT----- "THREE STRIKES-----" COUNTIES, COMPARED----------- TO A 12.7 PERCENT DROP IN THE TOUGHEST COUNTIES.-------------------------------------------------  A RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOK,--- PUNISHMENT----------- AND DEMOCRACY: THREE STRIKES AND YOU-RE OUT IN CALIFORNIA----, REPORTS----------- THE RESULTS OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" TO DATE. THE AUTHORS- FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, PRIOR TO----- "THREE STRIKES,----------------" CRIME RATES WERE DECLINING ALREADY AND, AFTER----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" THEY CONTINUED TO DECLINE AT ABOUT THE SAME RATE, SUGGESTING THAT WHATEVER----------- EFFECT----- "THREE STRIKES-----" HAD, IT WAS SMALL AT BEST. THE BOOK----------- ALSO NOTES THAT, PARTLY BECAUSE----- "THREE STRIKES-----" CASTS SUCH -----------A BROAD NET, THE OFFENDERS ARRESTED UNDER ITS PROVISIONS WERE NO MORE----------- LIKELY TO BE-HIGH-RATE OFFENDERS THAN NON-------THREE STRIKES----------------" ARRESTEES. NOR-WERE THEY MORE LIKELY TO-COMMIT VIOLENT OFFENSES.-------------------------------------------------  ALTHOUGH ITS PROPONENTS ORIGINALLY EXPLAINED----------- THAT----- "THREE STRIKES-----" WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT WOULD INCAPACITATE----------- HIGH-RATE OFFENDERS, THE DECLINE IN THE CRIME RATE CAME TOO EARLY TO----------- BE EXPLAINED ON THAT BASIS------"THREE STRIKES-----" IS A SENTENCE-ENHANCEMENT----------- PROVISION AND THE ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT KICK IN IMMEDIATELY, WHEREAS THE----------- DECLINE IN THE CRIME RATE-OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY.-AS A RESULT,----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" PROPONENTS WERE FORCED TO SHIFT THEIR EXPLANATION-THE----------- LAW DETERRED POTENTIAL OFFENDERS.-------------------------------------------------  THE AUTHORS-OF--- PUNISHMENT AND DEMOCRACY--------------- ATTEMPTED TO MEASURE THE LAW-S DETERRENT EFFECT. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES,----------- DEPENDING ON WHICH METHOD THE AUTHORS USED, THEY DID FIND A MARGINAL----------- DETERRENT EFFECT. BUT THE EFFECT WAS-EXTREMELY SMALL AND CANNOT EXPLAIN----------- THE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL DECLINE IN THE CRIME RATE.--- PUNISHMENT AND----------- DEMOCRACY---- ALSO ADDRESSED THE CLAIM OF THE LAW-S PROPONENTS THAT----------- A SHARP DECLINE IN THE CRIME RATE FOLLOWED PASSAGE-OF THE LAW. CONTRARY----------- TO THIS CLAIM, THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT THE DECLINE IN THE CRIME RATE----------- PRECEDED PASSAGE OF THE LAW. FURTHER, WERE----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" THE CAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE DECLINE, THE RATE OF DECLINE----------- SHOULD HAVE INCREASED AFTER ITS PASSAGE. INSTEAD, THE RATE OF DECLINE----------- REMAINED CONSTANT, SUGGESTING THAT THE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE THAT WERE----------- OPERATING PRIOR-TO THE PASSAGE OF THE LAW CONTINUED TO BE THE-PRIMARY----------- REASON FOR THE DROP IN CRIME RATES.---------------------------------------------------EMPIRICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA----------- WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS DECLINE IN CRIME WITHOUT---------------- "THREE STRIKES.-----" AT THE SAME TIME,----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON THE SIZE OF THE PRISON----------- POPULATION, AN EXPENSE THAT WILL GROW OVER TIME. ONE EFFECT WILL BE----------- TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OLDER PRISONERS, A GROUP THAT REPRESENTS A------------LOW SOCIAL RISK BECAUSE MOST OFFENDERS BECOME LESS CRIMINALLY ACTIVE----------- AS THEY AGE. NOT ONLY ARE OLDER PRISONERS NOT LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES----------- IF SET FREE, BUT THEY COST THE STATE MUCH MORE TO KEEP INCARCERATED----------- THAN YOUNGER,-HEALTHIER OFFENDERS.-------------------------------------------------  NONE OF THIS COMES-AS A SURPRISE TO MANY -----------COMMENTATORS WHO DOUBTED THE WISDOM OF----- "THREE STRIKES,-----" CERTAINLY----------- AS IT WAS ENACTED IN CALIFORNIA. BUT NONE OF US WHO OPPOSED----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" CAN TAKE MUCH COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT OUR CONCERNS WERE----------- BORNE OUT. THE IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE REFORM THE LAW----------- TO AVOID ITS EXCESSES?-------------------------------------------------  FEW POLITICIANS WERE WILLING TO OPPOSE---------------- "THREE STRIKES-----" DURING ITS PASSAGE. AND WHILE MOST POLITICIANS----------- IN THE PAST DECADE HAVE FEARED BEING LABELED AS SOFT ON CRIME, THAT----------- FEAR WAS EXACERBATED DURING THE LEGISLATION-S PASSAGE. AIDED BY THE----------- KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF YOUNG POLLY KLAAS, MIKE REYNOLDS,-THE FATHER----------- OF A MURDER VICTIM, PUSHED THE BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WITH REMARKABLE----------- RESOLVE. HE WAS UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE OR ALLOW AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL----------- (OR TO A VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL BALLOT INITIATIVE). HIS SWAY WITH THE LEGISLATURE----------- WAS EXTRAORDINARY, WITH MOST AFRAID THAT IF-THEY OPPOSED HIM, HE WOULD----------- PORTRAY THEM AS SOFT ON CRIME. SINCE THE LAW-S PASSAGE, PASSIONS HAVE----------- COOLED SOMEWHAT. BUT ONE LEGACY OF THE CHARGED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT----------- IN WHICH THE LAW PASSED IS THAT ITS AMENDMENT REQUIRES A SUPERMAJORITY.----------- AS A RESULT, EVEN-THOSE FEW POLITICIANS WHO ARE NOW WILLING TO PROPOSE -----------AMENDMENTS FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE AT BEST.--------------------------------------------------  IN THEORY, BOTH THE CALIFORNIA AND THE----------- U.S. CONSTITUTIONS PROTECT AGAINST THE IMPOSITION OF DISPROPORTIONATE----------- CRIMINAL PENALTIES. BUT OUTSIDE OF THE DEATH PENALTY CONTEXT, THAT PROTECTION----------- IS MORE THEORETICAL THAN REAL. DURING THE 1970S AND 1980S, THE CALIFORNIA----------- SUPREME COURT WAS ACTIVE IN REVIEWING INDETERMINATE SENTENCES AND DEVELOPED----------- A BODY OF CASE LAW WHEREIN IT OVERTURNED NUMEROUS SENTENCES AS EXCESSIVE----------- IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA-S PROTECTION AGAINST----- "CRUEL OR UNUSUAL----------- PUNISHMENT.--------" SEE----,--- E.G----.,--- PEOPLE V. DILLON,--------------- 668 P.2D 697 (1983). A NUMBER OF TRIAL COURTS RELIED ON THAT CASE LAW IN----------- STRIKING DOWN SOME OF THE MORE EXTREME----- "THREE STRIKES-----" SENTENCES----------- SHORTLY AFTER THE LAW BECAME EFFECTIVE. DESPITE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT----------- AND CONSIDERABLE SENTIMENT AMONG TRIAL COURTS THAT SOME----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" SENTENCES WERE EXCESSIVE, NO CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COURT----------- OF APPEAL AGREED.--- SEE----,--- E.G----.,--- PEOPLE V. AYON,--------------- 53 CAL. RPTR. 2D 853 (CT. APP. 1996). IN LIGHT OF UNANIMITY AMONG THE DISTRICT----------- COURTS OF APPEAL, THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SHOWN NO INCLINATION----------- TO REVISIT THE QUESTION.-------------------------------------------------  MORE RECENTLY, IN A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI,----------- FOUR U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SUGGESTED THAT SOME----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" SENTENCES MIGHT VIOLATE THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT-S PROHIBITION AGAINST CRUEL----------- AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.--- RIGGS V. CALIFORNIA----, 525 U.S. 1114 (1999).----------- SINCE THEN, THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS HELD IN THREE SEPARATE CASES THAT----------- A----- "THREE STRIKES-----" OFFENSE VIOLATES THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT.--- ANDRADE----------- V. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA----, 270 F.3D 743 (9TH CIR. 2001)----------- AND SEE---- THREE STRIKES- RULED UNJUST IN SHOPLIFTING CONVICTIONS-U.S.----------- APPEALS COURT DECISION MAY REDUCE TERMS FOR 340 INMATES,---- S.F. CHRON.,----------- FRIDAY, FEB. 8, 2002, AT A----------------------------------------------------- MEANINGFUL REVIEW OF----- "THREE STRIKES----------------" SENTENCES MIGHT WEED OUT MANY OF THE CASES IN WHICH TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR-TO-LIFE----------- SENTENCES SEEM EXCESSIVE. BUT TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS REMAIN. FIRST,----------- EVEN THE NINTH CIRCUIT-S DECISIONS MAY BE SEVERELY LIMITED IN THEIR----------- SCOPE. ALL THREE CASES DECIDED THUS-FAR-HAVE INVOLVED PETTY THEFT AS----------- THE THIRD STRIKE-OFFENSE. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, PETTY THEFT-IS A----- "WOBBLER,----------------" AN OFFENSE THAT MAY BE A MISDEMEANOR-OR A FELONY. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES----------- OF THE CASES BEFORE THE COURT,-THE OFFENDERS- RECORDS HAVE-LED TO THE------------CRIME BEING TREATED AS A FELONY. ONCE ESCALATED TO A FELONY, THE CRIME----------- BECOMES THE THIRD STRIKE. THE EFFECT OF THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF CALIFORNIA-S----------- SENTENCING LAWS IS THAT-WHAT MIGHT BE A MISDEMEANOR-ENDS UP RESULTING----------- IN A LIFE SENTENCE. IF THE NINTH CIRCUIT-S APPROACH TURNS ON THAT FEATURE----------- OF THE LAW, THE IMPACT OF THESE CASES IS QUITE LIMITED, PERHAPS TO AS----------- FEW AS 300-350 CASES OUT OF OVER THOUSANDS OF----- "THREE STRIKES------------------CASES. FOR-EXAMPLE, IF SO LIMITED, THE NINTH CIRCUIT-S APPROACH WOULD----------- OFFER LITTLE HOPE FOR AN OFFENDER WHOSE THIRD STRIKE WAS A MINOR POSSESSION----------- OF NARCOTICS OR MARIJUANA OFFENSE.-------------------------------------------------  THE OTHER IMPORTANT-QUESTION IS WHETHER----------- THE NINTH CIRCUIT-S DECISIONS WILL SURVIVE U.S. SUPREME COURT SCRUTINY.----------- EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED CALIFORNIA-S PETITION FOR----------- A WRIT OF-CERTIORARI. AS-INDICATED EARLIER, FOUR JUSTICES RAISED CONCERNS----------- ABOUT----- "THREE STRIKES-----" SENTENCES, AGAIN IN THE CONTEXT OF A----------- THEFT----- "WOBBLER-----" CASE. BUT WHETHER A FIFTH JUSTICE WOULD AGREE----------- IS OPEN TO SERIOUS QUESTION.-------------------------------------------------  THE SUPREME COURT HAS OVERTURNED A TERM----------- OF IMPRISONMENT AS A VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT IN ONLY ONE CASE.----------- IN--- SOLEM V. HELM----, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), THE COURT STRUCK DOWN----------- A TRUE LIFE SENTENCE IMPOSED ON A HABITUAL OFFENDER WHOSE CRIMINAL RECORD,----------- ALTHOUGH EXTENSIVE, DID NOT INCLUDE ANY CRIMES OF VIOLENCE. THE OFFENSE----------- THAT TRIGGERED THE LIFE SENTENCE WAS FOR-WRITING A BAD CHECK, AN-OFFENSE----------- DESCRIBED BY THE COURT AS PASSIVE AND NONVIOLENT. ALTHOUGH A MAJORITY----------- OF THE COURT REFUSED TO OVERRULE--- HELM---- WHEN IT NEXT CONSIDERED----------- THE QUESTION, THE COURT DID UPHOLD A TRUE LIFE SENTENCE FOR POSSESSION----------- OF MORE THAN-650 GRAMS OF COCAINE.--- HARMELIN V. MICHIGAN,--------------- 501 U.S.---- (1991). IN ADDITION, PRIOR TO--- HELM----, THE COURT UPHELD----------- A PAROLABLE LIFE SENTENCE IN--- RUMMEL V. ESTELLE----, 445 U.S.----------- 263 (1980), AND A SENTENCE OF FORTY YEARS FOR POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA IN-------------- HUTTO V. DAVIS,---- 454 U.S. 370 (1982). WERE THE COURT TO APPLY----------- THAT CASE LAW TO----- "THREE STRIKES,-----" WHETHER IT WOULD FIND ANY----------- GIVEN SENTENCE A VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT IS UNCERTAIN.------------------------------------------------------  "THREE STRIKES-----" REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT----------- MINIMUM SENTENCE, ONE THAT CAN BE REDUCED BY AT MOST 20 PERCENT FOR----------- GOOD TIME. HENCE, A----- "THREE STRIKES-----" OFFENDER MUST SERVE A----------- MINIMUM SENTENCE OF AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS. THAT MAY SEEM SIGNIFICANT,----------- AND IN SOME ROUGH SENSE, DISPROPORTIONATE TO AN OFFENDER-S THIRD-STRIKE----------- OFFENSE (FOR EXAMPLE, POSSESSION OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF DRUGS). BUT THE----------- PUNISHMENT IS LESS SEVERE THAN, SAY, THE OFFENDER IN--- HUTTO V. DAVIS----,----------- WHOSE FORTY-YEAR SENTENCE WAS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EXCESSIVE. INSTEAD,----------- LIKE RUMMEL, THE OFFENDER IN--- RUMMEL V. ESTELLE----, THE OFFENDER----------- IS NOT CONDEMNED TO A TRUE LIFE SENTENCE. EVEN IF THE LONG MINIMUM SENTENCE----------- HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF A TRUE LIFE SENTENCE-FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN IT----------- IS IMPOSED ON AN OLDER OFFENDER WHO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WILL PROBABLY----------- DIE IN PRISON BEFORE SERVING HIS ENTIRE SENTENCE-THE CASE MAY NOT COME----------- WITHIN--- SOLEM V. HELM----. WHILE THE COURT STRUCK DOWN A SENTENCE----------- IMPOSED ON A HABITUAL OFFENDER, HIS ENTIRE CRIMINAL RECORD DID NOT INCLUDE----------- A CRIME OF VIOLENCE. AT LEAST FOR THOSE OFFENDERS WHOSE EARLIER CRIMES----------- HAVE INCLUDED CRIMES OF VIOLENCE, THEIR EARLIER CRIMINAL RECORDS MAY----------- BE ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM OUT OF--- HELM-----S NARROW HOLDING. PERHAPS----------- AN OLDER OFFENDER WHOSE MINIMUM SENTENCE MAY BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A----------- LIFE SENTENCE AND WHOSE TWO STRIKES WERE RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES AND----------- WHOSE THIRD STRIKE IS A RELATIVELY MINOR OFFENSE, LIKE POSSESSION OF----------- DRUGS, COULD INVOKE EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROTECTION. BUT THOSE CASES MAY----------- BE TOO FEW TO HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE PROBLEM CREATED BY----- "THREE----------- STRIKES.------------------------------------------------------"  THE ISSUE BEARS WATCHING. EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT----------- RAISES SERIOUS MORAL QUESTIONS. BEYOND THE MORAL QUESTION,----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" OPPONENTS HAVE MOUNTING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT----- "THREE----------- STRIKES-----" CANNOT DELIVER ON ITS OVERBLOWN PROMISES. BUT LEGISLATIVE----------- REFORM, DIFFICULT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE DUE TO POLITICIANS- FEARS----------- OF BEING LABELED SOFT ON CRIME, IS DOUBLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE SUPERMAJORITY----------- REQUIREMENT. WE ARE LEFT HOPING THAT THE COURTS WILL SAVE US FROM OUR----------- OWN EXCESSES; WHETHER THEY WILL IS VERY MUCH UP FOR GRABS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------  MICHAEL VITIELLO IS A PROFESSOR OF LAW----------- AT MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW IN CALIFORNIA.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BIBLIOGRAPHY-----------------------------------------------------  LINDA S.
