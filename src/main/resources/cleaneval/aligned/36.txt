GOV. CELLUCCI'S PLAN WOULD PHASE IN HIS TAX RATE---- REDUCTION OVER THREE YEARS; WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, IN THE THIRD YEAR, IT WOULD REDUCE---- REVENUE BY ABOUT $1.2 BILLION.---------------------- REGARDLESS, WHEN THE POLS TOOK THE MONEY FROM US WITH THEIR----- "TEMPORARY---------" RATE INCREASE, DID ANYONE ASK IF YOU COULD AFFORD IT, OR WHETHER YOU'D RATHER IF THEY ----PHASED IT IN GRADUALLY-OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS?---------------------- AND WHAT'S THIS----- "TAKE $1.2 BILLION OUT-OF THE COFFERS-----"?---- IT SHOULDN'T---- STILL-BE GOING INTO THE COFFERS---------------------------!
