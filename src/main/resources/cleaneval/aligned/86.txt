IT DOESN'T WORK HERE.-IT HAS THE RING OF UTTER INEPTITUDE.- THE DETAILS HAVE-- NO RELEVANCE, OF COURSE, TO WHAT IS BEING NARRATED (SAUNI--------RE IS-FLEEING AN ATTACKER AND PULLS DOWN THE PAINTING TO TRIGGER THE ALARM-SYSTEM AND THE SECURITY GATES).- WE COULD HAVE DEDUCED THAT HE WOULD BE FAIRLY WELL KNOWN IN THE MUSEUM TRADE FROM THE FACT THAT HE WAS-CURATING AT THE LOUVRE.-------  THE WRITING GOES ON IN SIMILAR VEIN, COMMITTING STYLE AND WORD-CHOICE BLUNDERS IN ALMOST EVERY PARAGRAPH (SOMETIMES EVERY LINE).-------LOOK AT THE PHRASE "THE SEVENTY-SIX-YEAR-OLD MAN".-IT'S A COMPLETE LET-DOWN: WE KNEW HE-- WAS A MAN---- -- THE ANAPHORIC PRONOUN "HE" HAD JUST BEEN USED TO REFER TO HIM.------ (THIS IS PERHAPS WHERE "CURATOR" COULD HAVE BEEN SLIPPED IN FOR-THE-FIRST TIME, WITHOUT "RENOWNED", IF THE PASSAGE WERE-REWRITTEN.)-LOOK AT "HEAVED THE MASTERPIECE TOWARD HIMSELF UNTIL-------- IT TORE FROM THE WALL AND SAUNI--------RE COLLAPSED BACKWARD IN A HEAP---- BENEATH THE CANVAS.-" WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW IT'S A MASTERPIECE (IT'S A CARAVAGGIO HANGING IN THE LOUVRE, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH IN THE WAY OF----------- CREDENTIALS, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE).- SURELY "TOWARD HIM- FEELS BETTER THAN "TOWARD HIMSELF----------------------" (THOUGH I GUESS BOTH ARE GRAMMATICAL HERE).- SURELY "TORE FROM THE WALL" SHOULD-BE "TORE AWAY FROM THE WALL".- SURELY A SINGLE MAN CAN'T FALL INTO A-HEAP (THERE'S ONLY HIM, THAT'S NOT A HEAP).- AND WHY REPEAT THE NAME-"SAUNI--------RE" HERE INSTEAD OF THE PRONOUN "HE"?- WHO ELSE----- IS AROUND?- (CARAVAGGIO HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED; "A-CARAVAGGIO" USES THE NAME AS AN ATTRIBUTIVE MODIFIER WITH CONVENTIONALLY-ELIDED HEAD NOUN "PAINTING-.- THAT ISN'T A MENTION OF THE MAN.)-------  WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE--- IS---- SOMEONE ELSE AROUND, BUT WE ONLY LEARN THAT-THREE PARAGRAPHS DOWN, AFTER "A THUNDERING IRON GATE" HAS FALLEN (BY THE-WAY, IT'S THE FALL THAT MAKES A THUNDERING NOISE: THERE'S NO SUCH THING-AS A THUNDERING GATE).-"THE-CURATOR" (HIS PROFESSION IS NOW NAMED A SECOND TIME IN-CASE YOU MISSED IT)- "...CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER THE CANVAS AND SCANNED THE CAVERNOUS SPACE-FOR SOMEPLACE TO HIDE" (THE COLLOQUIAL AMERICAN "SOMEPLACE" SEEMS VERY------------- ODD HERE AS COMPARED WITH STANDARD "SOMEWHERE").- THEN:---------------------------------------------------------  A VOICE SPOKE, CHILLINGLY CLOSE. "DO NOT MOVE.------------------------"  ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, THE CURATOR FROZE, TURNING HIS-HEAD SLOWLY.------  ONLY FIFTEEN FEET AWAY, OUTSIDE THE SEALED GATE, THE MOUNTAINOUS----------- SILHOUETTE OF HIS ATTACKER STARED THROUGH THE IRON BARS.------------------ HE WAS BROAD AND TALL, WITH GHOST-PALE SKIN AND THINNING WHITE HAIR.---- HIS IRISES WERE PINK WITH DARK RED PUPILS.----------------------------  JUST COUNT THE INFELICITIES HERE.-A VOICE DOESN'T SPEAK---- --A PERSON SPEAKS; A VOICE IS WHAT A PERSON SPEAKS--- WITH----.-"CHILLINGLY CLOSE" WOULD BE RIGHT IN YOUR EAR, WHEREAS THIS VOICE IS--------- FIFTEEN FEET AWAY BEHIND THE THUNDERING GATE.- THE CURATOR (DO WE REALLY NEED TO BE-TOLD HIS PROFESSION A--- THIRD---- TIME?) CANNOT SLOWLY TURN HIS HEAD IF HE-HAS FROZEN; FREEZING (AS A-VOLUNTARY HUMAN ACTION) MEANS TEMPORARILY-CEASING-ALL MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS.- AND CRUCIALLY, A SILHOUETTE-DOES NOT STARE-! A SILHOUETTE IS A SHADOW.- IF SAUNI--------RE CAN SEE THE MAN'S-PALE SKIN, THINNING HAIR, IRIS COLOR, AND RED PUPILS (ALL AT FIFTEEN FEET),-THE MAN CANNOT POSSIBLY BE IN SILHOUETTE.-------  BROWN'S WRITING IS NOT JUST BAD; IT IS STAGGERINGLY, CLUMSILY,-THOUGHTLESSLY, ALMOST INGENIOUSLY BAD.- IN SOME PASSAGES SCARCELY-A--- WORD OR PHRASE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN-CAREFULLY SELECTED OR COMPARED WITH-ALTERNATIVES.- I SLOGGED THROUGH---4 PAGES OF THIS SYNTACTIC SWILL, AND-IT NEVER GETS MUCH BETTER.---------------- WHY DID I KEEP READING?- BECAUSE LONDON HEATHROW IS A LONG WAY FROM SAN-FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL,--- AND AIRLINE MAGAZINES ARE THIN, AND TWO-MONTH-OLD HOLLYWOOD DRIVEL ON A-SMALL-SCREEN HANGING TWO SEATS IN FRONT OF MY ROW DID NOT APPEAL, THAT'S WHY.-AND WHY DID I KEEP THE BOOK INSTEAD OF DROPPING IT INTO A HEATHROW-TRASH BIN?--BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO-ME TO BE SUCH A FUND OF LESSONS-IN HOW NOT TO WRITE.-------  I DON'T THINK I'D WANT TO SAY THESE THINGS ABOUT-A FIRST-TIME NOVELIST,---- IT WOULD SEEM A CRUEL BLOW-TO A BUDDING CAREER.- BUT DAN BROWN IS ALL--- OVER THE BEST-SELLER LISTS NOW.- IN PAPERBACK AND HARDBACK, AND IN MANY-LANGUAGES, HE IS A PHENOMENON.- HE IS UP THERE WITH THE STEPHEN KINGS-AND THE JOHN GRISHAMS AND NOTHING I SAY CAN CONCEIVABLY HARM HIM.- HE IS-A HUGE, BLOCKBUSTER, WORLDWIDE SUCCESS WHO CAN GO ANYWHERE HE WANTS AND-NEED NEVER WORK AGAIN.- AND HE WRITES LIKE THE KIND OF FRESHMAN STUDENT--------------WHO MAKES YOU WANT TO-GIVE UP THE WHOLE IDEA OF TEACHING.- NEVER MIND THE RIDICULOUS PLOT AND THE STUPID ANAGRAMS AND-------------- PUZZLE CLUES AS THE BOOK PROCEEDS, THIS IS-A TERRIBLE,-TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF THE THRILLER-WRITER'S CRAFT.-------  WHICH BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION OF THE BLURBS.- "DAN BROWN HAS TO----------- BE ONE OF THE BEST, SMARTEST, AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED WRITERS IN THE-COUNTRY," SAID NELSON DEMILLE, A BESTSELLING AUTHOR WHO HAS HIMSELF-HIT THE #1 SPOT IN THE--- NEW YORK TIMES---- LIST.- UNBELIEVABLE-MENDACITY.-AND THERE ARE FOUR OTHER SIMILAR PIECES OF PRAISE ON THE BACK COVER.-TOGETHER THOSE BLURBS CONVINCED ME TO PUT THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE-ON THE COSTCO CART-ALONG WITH THE THE 72-PACK OF TOILET-ROLLS.- THRILLER WRITERS MUST HAVE A CODE OF HONOR THAT REQUIRES-THAT THEY ALL PRAISE EACH OTHER'S NEW NOVELS, A KIND OF--- OMERTA-----THAT ENJOINS THEM TO SILENCE ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME FELLOW MEMBER-OF THE GUILD HAS GIVEN EVIDENCE OF-TOTAL STYLISTIC CLUELESSNESS.--A FRATERNAL CODE OF SILENCE.- WE COULD-CALL IT...- THE DA VINCI CODE; OR THE DAN BROWN CODE.---------------------   *-------THE THIRD NON-READER WAS UNKNOWN WHEN THIS POST WAS-FIRST DRAFTED, BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN EDITED, AND AS OF TODAY (MAY 2, 2004)-I CAN CONFIRM THAT BILL POSER AND DANNY YEE ARE BOTH CLAIMING NOT TO HAVE-READ--- THE DA VINCI CODE----.- FAIR ENOUGH.- SO AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE-HAVE NOT READ IT.- I JUST WISH ONE OF THEM WAS ME.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
