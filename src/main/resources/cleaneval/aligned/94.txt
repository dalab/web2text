THE CYCLE WHICH CHRIST INAUGURATED HAS BEEN ONE IN WHICH MEN HAVE---- BECOME STRICTLY HUMAN. UP TILL THAT INCARNATION THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THOSE WHO, HAVING---- ACHIEVED HUMANITY, HAD THEN PASSED ON TO DEMONSTRATE DIVINITY. BUT NOW THE WHOLE RACE IS---- AT THE POINT OF SO DOING. ALTHOUGH TODAY MEN ARE PREDOMINANTLY ANIMAL-EMOTIONAL, YET---- THROUGH THE SUCCESS OF THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS - LEADING AS IT HAS TO OUR WIDESPREAD---- EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND THE GENERAL HIGH LEVEL OF MENTAL AWARENESS - MEN HAVE REACHED THE---- POINT WHERE THE MASSES THEMSELVES, GIVEN PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT, CAN----- "ENTER INTO THE---- KINGDOM OF GOD.-----" WHO CAN SAY THAT IT IS NOT THIS REALIZATION, DIM AND UNCERTAIN AS IT---- MAY BE, WHICH PROMPTS THE UNIVERSAL UNREST AND THE WIDESPREAD DETERMINATION TO BETTER---- CONDITIONS? THAT WE INTERPRET THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN TERMS OF THE MATERIAL IS INEVITABLE AT---- FIRST, BUT IT IS A HOPEFUL AND SPIRITUAL SIGN THAT WE ARE TODAY SO [192] BUSY CLEANING---- HOUSE, AND THUS ATTEMPTING TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF OUR CIVILIZATION. CHRIST INCARNATED WHEN,---- FOR THE FIRST TIME, HUMANITY WAS A COMPLETE WHOLE, AS FAR AS THE FORM SIDE ITS NATURE WAS---- CONCERNED, WITH ALL THE QUALITIES MANIFESTING - PHYSICAL, PSYCHIC AND MENTAL - WHICH---- DISTINGUISH THE HUMAN ANIMAL. HE BROUGHT TO US A MANIFESTATION OF WHAT THE PERFECT MAN---- COULD BE WHO, REGARDING THAT FORM SIDE AS THE TEMPLE OF GOD, BUT RECOGNIZING HIS INNATE---- DIVINITY, STRIVES TO BRING IT TO THE FOREGROUND, FIRST OF ALL IN HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS AND---- THEN BEFORE THE WORLD. THIS CHRIST DID. THE MYSTERIES HAD ALWAYS BEEN REVEALED TO THE---- INDIVIDUAL WHO FITTED HIMSELF TO PENETRATE INTO A HIDDEN ARCANUM OR TEMPLE, BUT CHRIST---- REVEALED THEM TO HUMANITY AS A WHOLE, AND ENACTED THE WHOLE DRAMA OF THE GOD-MAN BEFORE---- THE RACE. THIS WAS HIS MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT, AND THIS WE HAVE FORGOTTEN - THE LIVING CHRIST---- - IN THE EMPHASIS WE HAVE LAID UPON MAN HIMSELF, ON HIS RELATION TO HIMSELF AS A SINNER, AND---- TO GOD AS THE ONE AGAINST WHOM HE HAS SINNED.-  AGAIN, EVERY GREAT ORGANIZATION OR GROUP---- RELIGION OR CULT OF ANY KIND HAS ORIGINATED WITH A PERSON, AND FROM THAT PERSON THE IDEA---- HAS SPREAD OUT INTO THE WORLD, GATHERING ADHERENTS AS TIME ELAPSED. CHRIST IN THIS WAY---- PRECIPITATED THE KINGDOM OF GOD UPON EARTH. IT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES.---- HE CAUSED IT TO MATERIALIZE, THUS BECOMING A FACT TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MEN.----------  PREPAREDNESS FOR THE KINGDOM, AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE TIME WHEN MEN IN LARGE NUMBERS---- COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES, REQUIRED FROM THEM A RECOGNITION OF AN UNWORTHINESS---- AND A SINFULNESS WHICH ONLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIND COULD GIVE. THE AGE OF---- CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN AN AGE OF MENTAL UNFOLDMENT. IT HAS BEEN AN AGE ALSO WHEREIN MUCH---- EMPHASIS HAS BEEN LAID UPON SIN AND EVIL DOING. THERE IS NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN IN THE---- ANIMALS, THOUGH THERE MAY BE INDICATIONS OF A CONSCIENCE AMONG THE DOMESTICATED ANIMALS,---- DUE TO THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH MAN. MIND PRODUCES THE POWER TO ANALYZE A OBSERVE, TO---- DIFFERENTIATE AND DISTINGUISH; AND SO WITH THE [193] ADVENT OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT THERE---- HAS BEEN, FOR A LONG TIME, A GROWING SENSE OF SINFULNESS, OF CONTRITION, AND OF AN ALMOST---- ABJECT ATTITUDE TO THE CREATOR, PRODUCING IN HUMANITY THAT STRONGLY MARKED INFERIORITY---- COMPLEX WITH WHICH TODAY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE TO DEAL. AGAINST THIS SENSE OF SIN, WITH ITS---- CONCOMITANTS OF PROPITIATION, AT-ONE-MENT AND THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST FOR US, THERE HAS---- BEEN A REVOLT; AND IN THIS REALLY WHOLESOME REACTION THERE IS THE NORMAL TENDENCY TO GO---- TOO FAR. FORTUNATELY, WE ARE NEVER ABLE TO GET TOO FAR FROM DIVINITY; AND THAT, AS A RACE,---- WE SHALL SWING BACK INTO A STATE OF GREATER SPIRITUALITY THAN EVER BEFORE IS THE SINCERE---- BELIEF OF ALL WHO KNOW. THEOLOGY OVER-REACHED ITSELF WITH ITS----- "MISERABLE SINNER---------" COMPLEX AND ITS EMPHASIS UPON THE NECESSITY FOR THE PURIFICATION BY BLOOD. THIS TEACHING---- OF PURIFICATION THROUGH THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND OF RAMS (OR LAMBS) WAS PART OF THE ANCIENT---- MYSTERIES, AND WAS INHERITED BY US PRIMARILY FROM THE MYSTERIES OF MITHRA. THESE---- MYSTERIES, IN THEIR TURN, INHERITED THE TEACHING, AND THUS FORMULATED THEIR DOCTRINE,---- WHICH CHRISTIANITY ABSORBED. WHEN THE SUN WAS IN THE ZODIACAL SIGN OF TAURUS THE BULL, THE---- SACRIFICE OF THE BULL WAS OFFERED AS A FORECAST OF THAT WHICH CHRIST CAME LATER TO REVEAL.-----WHEN THE SUN PASSED (IN THE PRECESSION OF THE-EQUINOXES) INTO THE NEXT SIGN, THAT OF ARIES---- THE RAM, WE FIND THE LAMB WAS SACRIFICED AND THE SCAPEGOAT SENT INTO THE WILDERNESS.---- CHRIST WAS BORN INTO THE NEXT SIGN, PISCES THE FISHES, AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE---- EAT FISH ON GOOD FRIDAY, IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS COMING. TERTULLIAN, ONE OF THE EARLY---- CHURCH FATHERS, SPEAKS OF JESUS CHRIST AS THE----- "GREAT FISH,-----" AND OF US, HIS---- FOLLOWERS, AS THE----- "LITTLE FISHES.-----" THESE FACTS ARE WELL KNOWN, AS THE FOLLOWING---- EXTRACT WILL INDICATE:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "THE------ CEREMONIES OF PURIFICATION BY THE SPRINKLING OR DRENCHING OF THE NOVICE WITH THE BLOOD OF-------BULLS OR RAMS WERE WIDESPREAD, AND WERE TO BE FOUND IN THE RITES OF MITHRA. BY THIS------ PURIFICATION A MAN WAS 'BORN AGAIN' AND THE CHRISTIAN EXPRESSION 'WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF------ THE LAMB' IS UNDOUBTEDLY A REFLECTION OF THIS IDEA, THE REFERENCE THUS BEING CLEAR IN THE------ WORDS OF THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS: 'IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE BLOOD OF BULLS-AND OF------ GOATS SHOULD TAKE AWAY-------SINS.' IN THIS PASSAGE THE-WRITER GOES ON TO SAY: 'HAVING------ BOLDNESS TO ENTER INTO THE HOLIEST BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS, BY A NEW AND-LIVING WAY WHICH HE ------HATH CONSECRATED FOR-US THROUGH THE VEIL, THAT IS TO SAY HIS FLESH...-LET US DRAW NEAR...------ HAVING OUR HEARTS SPRINKLED FROM AN EVIL CONSCIENCE, AND OUR BODIES WASHED-WITH PURE------ WATER.' BUT WHEN WE LEARN THAT THE MITHRAIC-INITIATION CEREMONY CONSISTED IN ENTERING------ BOLDLY INTO A MYSTERIOUS UNDERGROUND-'HOLY OF HOLIES' WITH THE EYES VEILED, AND THERE------ BEING SPRINKLED WITH BLOOD, AND WASHED WITH WATER, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE------ EPISTLE THINKING OF THOSE MITHRAIC RITES WITH WHICH EVERYBODY AT THAT TIME MUST-HAVE BEEN------ SO FAMILIAR.-------------------" - THE PAGANISM IN OUR CHRISTIANITY-----, BY ARTHUR WEIGALL, PP. 132,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CHRIST CAME---- TO ABOLISH THESE SACRIFICES-BY SHOWING US THEIR TRUE MEANING, AND IN HIS PERSON-AS PERFECT---- MAN HE DIED THE DEATH OF THE CROSS TO SHOW US (IN PICTURE FORM AND THROUGH ACTUAL---- DEMONSTRATION) THAT DIVINITY CAN BE MANIFESTED AND CAN TRULY EXPRESS ITSELF ONLY WHEN MAN,---- AS MAN, HAS DIED IN ORDER THAT THE HIDDEN CHRIST MAY LIVE. THE LOWER CARNAL NATURE (AS ST.---- PAUL LOVED TO CALL IT) MUST DIE IN ORDER THAT THE HIGHER DIVINE NATURE MAY SHOW FORTH IN---- ALL ITS BEAUTY. THE LOWER SELF MUST DIE IN ORDER THAT THE HIGHER SELF CAN MANIFEST ON---- EARTH. CHRIST HAD TO DIE IN ORDER THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL MANKIND MIGHT LEARN THE LESSON---- THAT BY THE SACRIFICE OF THE HUMAN NATURE THE DIVINE ASPECT MIGHT BE----- "SAVED.---------" THUS CHRIST SUMMED UP IN HIMSELF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF-ALL THE PAST WORLD SACRIFICES. THAT---- MYSTERIOUS TRUTH WHICH HAD BEEN REVEALED ONLY TO THE PLEDGED AND TRAINED INITIATE WHEN HE---- WAS READY FOR THE FOURTH INITIATION WAS--- GIVEN OUT BY CHRIST TO THE WORLD OF MEN.---- HE---- DIED FOR ALL SO THAT ALL MIGHT LIVE. BUT THIS IS NOT THE DOCTRINE OF THE VICARIOUS---- AT-ONE-MENT WHICH WAS PRE-EMINENTLY ST. PAUL'S INTERPRETATION OF THE CRUCIFIXION, BUT THE---- DOCTRINE WHICH CHRIST HIMSELF TAUGHT - THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE IMMANENCE (SEE ST. JOHN-----XVII), AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOD-MAN.----------  CHRISTIANITY INHERITED MANY OF ITS INTERPRETATIONS, AND THE TEACHERS AND INTERPRETERS---- OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES WERE NO MORE FREE FROM THE THRALLDOM OF ANCIENT BELIEFS THAN---- ARE WE--195] FROM THE INTERPRETATIONS GIVEN-TO CHRISTIANITY DURING THE PAST TWO THOUSAND---- YEARS. CHRIST DID GIVE US THE TEACHING THAT WE MUST DIE IN ORDER-TO LIVE AS GODS, AND-----THEREFORE HE DIED. HE DID SUM UP IN HIMSELF ALL THE TRADITIONS OF THE PAST FOR-HE--------- "NOT ONLY FULFILED THE JUDAIC SCRIPTURES, BUT HE ALSO FULFILED THOSE OF THE PAGAN---- WORLD, AND THEREIN LAY THE GREAT APPEAL OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY. IN HIM A DOZEN SHADOWY GODS---- WERE CONDENSED INTO A-PROXIMATE REALITY; AND IN HIS CRUCIFIXION THE OLD STORIES OF THEIR---- GHASTLY AT-ONING SUFFERINGS AND SACRIFICIAL DEATHS WERE MADE ACTUAL AND GIVEN A DIRECT---- MEANING.-----" (IBID., P. 166.) BUT HIS DEATH WAS ALSO THE CONSUMMATING ACT OF A LIFE-OF-----SACRIFICE AND SERVICE, AND THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF-HIS TEACHING. PIONEERS AND THOSE WHO---- REVEAL TO MEN THEIR NEXT STEP, THOSE-WHO COME FORTH AS THE INTERPRETERS OF THE DIVINE---- PLAN, INEVITABLY ARE REPUDIATED, AND USUALLY DIE AS THE RESULT OF THEIR COURAGEOUS---- PRONOUNCEMENTS. TO THIS RULE CHRIST WAS NO EXCEPTION.----- "ADVANCED CHRISTIAN THINKERS---- NOW REGARD THE CRUCIFIXION OF OUR LORD AS THE SUPREME SACRIFICE MADE BY HIM FOR THE SAKE---- OF THE PRINCIPLES OF HIS TEACHING. IT WAS THE CROWNING ACT OF HIS MOST HEROIC LIFE, AND IT-----AFFORDS SUCH A SUBLIME EXAMPLE TO MANKIND THAT MEDITATION UPON IT-MAY BE SAID TO PRODUCE A---- CONDITION OF AT-ONE-MENT WITH THE FOUNTAINHEAD OF ALL GOODNESS.-----" (IBID., P. 166.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
