(EXAMPLE: 1 SMALL CLASS WOULD BE $10, A SMALL------ "ASSEMBLY------" OR-MORNING'------S WORTH OF INDIVIDUAL CLASSES MIGHT BE $30, A MULTI-DAY-PRESENTATION TO SIX CLASSES WOULD APPROACH $100.)------ THIS AMOUNT-GOES TO FRIENDS OF PINE MOUNTAIN OBSERVATORY, NOT TO THE INSTRUCTOR,-AND------ IS USED TO OFFSET OUR OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY THE-PRODUCTION/DISTRIBUTION OF THE PREP VIDEO, CURRICULUM MATERIALS, AND-HARDWARE USAGE.------ NASA'S OREGON SPACE GRANT CURRENTLY-COVERS-INSTRUCTOR COST AND TRAVEL-COSTS FOR TRIPS THROUGHOUT WESTERN-OREGON.------ FOR EXTENDED DISTANT TRIPS, WE MAY REQUEST SOME-ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO HELP COVER THE TRAVEL EXPENSES.------ VISITING-MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS DURING ONE TRIP WILL HELP SHARE COSTS.-------------------------------- CONTENTS OF OUTREACH CLASS SESSIONS:---- VARIETY OF PROGRAMS FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS:----------------------- THE BASIC PRESENTATION COVERS HOW STUDENTS-AT ANY GRADE LEVEL CAN DO-REAL-SCIENCE WITH THE SKY BY MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS.------ FOR-GRADE-4 AND HIGHER WE PROVIDE AN INTRODUCTION TO HOW DATA CAN BE COLLECTED-DIGITALLY,-AND HOW DIGITAL DATA CAN BE MEASURED AND PUT TO USE.------ WE GENERALLY-DON'T-PRESENT HISTORICAL NARRATIVES, COLLECTIONS OF STATISTICS, NOR COVER-CONSTELLATION-INFORMATION OR LORE (WE CAN POINT YOU TO RESOURCES FOR THESE TOPICS).------------------- PREP SESSION, PRIOR TO OUTREACH, IS VERY IMPORTANT, PARTICULARLY TO-CLARIFY-VOCABULARY OF OBJECTS AND VASTNESS OF SPACE.------ SEE BELOW FOR-SUGGESTED-TOPICS, AND ABOUT THE NEW FREE PREP VIDEO.------------------- BASIC THEME: SURVEYING THE SKY:------ IF WE EXAMINE THE SKY WITH OUR-EYES,-WITH A TELESCOPE, OR WITH A CAMERA, WHAT DO WE SEE?------------------- CAN WE CHARACTERIZE AND CLASSIFY OBJECTS BY MAKING OBSERVATIONS?---- SORTING OUT OBJECTS BY APPARENT SIZE AND BRIGHTNESS.---- OBSERVING CHANGE IN APPEARANCE AND POSITION OVER TIME.---- ARRANGING OUR DATA TO USE THE DATA TO DRAW RATIONAL CONCLUSIONS.---- MAKING MODELS TO EXPLAIN OUR OBSERVATIONS.---- WHAT ARE "PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS- OF OBJECTS/PHENOMENA?---- CAN WE MEASURE SUCH CHARACTERISTICS OF VERY DISTANT OBJECTS?------------------- WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE INQUIRY-BASED PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH,-NOT-WITH "FACTOIDS".------ OUR PROGRAM-STAYS AWAY FROM "FACTOIDS" AND DOES-NOT-DEAL WITH TOPICS SUCH AS CONSTELLATION LORE/HISTORY (ALTHOUGH THESE-TOPICS-ARE EXCELLENT CROSS-CURRICULUM CONTENT!)------ OFTEN WE DEAL WITH-QUESTIONS-THAT DO NOT HAVE A "RIGHT ANSWER" NOR EVEN ANY ANSWER AT THIS TIME.---- WE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO COLLECT AND EVALUATE DATA.--------------------INTEGRATED WITH THE ABOVE INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES, HERE ARE SOME OF-THE-SPECIFIC CONTENT AREAS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STUDENTS TO EXPLORE:-------------------------------- A.---- INTRODUCTION TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM:------ SUN-EARTH-MOON-AND BEYOND:------ WE CAN ADDRESS MOTIONS/VIEWS OF SUN-EARTH-MOON AND-SOLAR-SYSTEM, USING KINESTHETIC MODELS, A NEW DYNAMIC VIRTUAL REALITY-GRAPHICAL-MODEL, SCALE MODELS, AND LOTS OF IMAGES FROM VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL-SOURCES.------ WHY-ARE PLANETS AND STARS SPHERICAL?------ WHY DO THEY ROTATE?------ WHY-DO THE PLANETS ORBIT THE SUN IN A PLANE?------ WHY DO WE SEE THE MOON-AND-CERTAIN PLANETS ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES?------ THIS PROGRAM IS SUITABLE-FOR-EARLY ELEMENTARY, AND CAN BE ADAPTED FOR HIGHER GRADES WHERE STUDENTS-NEED-INFORMATION FOR THE COMMON CURRICULUM GOALS EARTH-IN-SPACE BENCHMARKS.-------------------------------- B.---- INTRODUCTION TO TECHNOLOGIES TO EXPLORE DEEP SPACE:---- HOW WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT VERY DISTANT OBJECTS/PHENOMENA:----- WE BRING A SMALL TELESCOPE PLUS A PORTABLE CCD CAMERA THAT STUDENTS CAN-USE-TO EXPLORE HOW DISTANT LIGHT IS COLLECTED AND DETECTED, AND HOW DIGITAL-IMAGES-CAN BE ENHANCED AND MEASURED.------ WHAT ARE THE TWO BASIC-MEASUREMENTS?------ WHAT CAN THESE MEASUREMENTS TELL US ABOUT CHARACTERISTICS OF DISTANT-OBJECTS?------ THIS MATERIAL IS VERY SUITABLE FOR GRADES 4-12 AND PORTIONS CAN BE-ADAPTED-FOR EARLY ELEMENTARY.---- WE ALSO USE-A VARIETY OF HIGH TECH JAVA BASED INTERACTIVE GRAPHICAL-"APPLETS-"DEVELOPED BY PROFESSOR GREG BOTHUN AT U OF O TO ILLUSTRATE VARIOUS-PRINCIPLES-OF PHYSICS AND-ASTROPHYSICS SUCH AS-PRODUCTION OF PHOTONS, PRODUCTION-OF-THERMAL SPECTRUM, AND NATURE OF DETECTORS.---- GREG AND ORI ARE BOTH DEVELOPING NEW VIRTUAL LAB ACTIVITIES AND WE'LL-SHOWCASE-THESE AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.-------------------------------- C.---- COMPUTER LABS: TWO YEARS AGO WE COMMENCED THIS-ACTIVITY,-SIX SCHOOLS, FROM GRADES 3-12 WERE SUCCESSFUL.------ WE PRELOAD FREE-FITSVIEW-IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE PLUS A SERIES OF IMAGES TO ANALYZE.------------ THERE-ARE FOUR PAIRS OF IMAGES TAKEN ONE NIGHT APART, THAT HAVE ONE OF THE-FOUR-OUTER PLANETS (SATURN-PLUTO) IN EACH PAIR OF IMAGES.------ THE JOB OF-THE-STUDENTS IS TO FIND THE PLANET IN EACH PAIR OF IMAGES AND THEN TO-IDENTIFY-WHICH PLANET BY MEASURING RELATIVE SHIFT FROM NIGHT TO NIGHT AND ALSO-COMPARING-BRIGHTNESS. WE DO THIS AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE IN-CLASS SESSION DESCRIBED-IN-PART B, ABOVE.------ IF YOUR SCHOOL HAS A WINDOWS OR MAC LAB, YOU CAN-PARTICIPATE.-------------------------------- D.---- OVERVIEW OF THE CASSINI-HUGENS MISSION TO SATURN-AND-TITAN:------ A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION COVERING OVERVIEW OF MISSION,-SPACECRAFT,-FLIGHT, SCIENTIFIC GOALS, AND SHOWING CURRENT IMAGES SENT BACK FROM-SATURN-AND ITS MOONS.------ THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK FOR LARGER-GROUPS/ASSEMBLIES.------ WE DO SOME SCALE MODEL ACTIVITIES BUT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THE-INFORMATION-AND PICTURES SUPPLIED BY NASA AND JPL.------ WE FURNISH TEACHERS WITH A-SUMMARY-HANDOUT SHEET INCLUDING URLS.-------------------------------- WORKSHEETS AND EVALUATION SHEETS:----------------------- MOST TEACHERS HAVE REQUESTED USE OF WORKSHEETS FOR CLASSES AT 5TH GRADE-LEVEL-AND HIGHER.------ WE NORMALLY BRING A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK STYLE WORKSHEET-FOR-DUPLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION AT START OF CLASS.----------- WE CAN SEND THE MASTER TO YOU AHEAD OF TIME IF YOU WISH TO PRINT IT-BEFOREHAND.---- SOMETIMES WE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO USE A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN-WE-MAKE NOTES TOGETHER ON A PROJECTED WINDOW FROM THE LAPTOP.---- WE SUPPLY A KEY FOR THE TEACHER FOR USE IN REVIEW AFTER THE CLASS.---- WE ALSO BRING A PAGE FOR STUDENTS WITH A FEW QUESTIONS TO FILL OUT FOR-FEEDBACK-FOR US ON HOW THE CLASSES CAN BE IMPROVED, AND WE SUPPLY TEACHERS WITH-A-MORE DETAILED QUESTIONAIRE.------ THESE SURVEYS CAN BE MAILED BACK TO-ME-AND ARE USUALLY DONE FOR HOMEWORK OR THE NEXT DAY, AS OUR SESSIONS-USUALLY-RUN THE WHOLE CLASS PERIOD.------------------------------------- PREP VIDEO----------------------- TOM CLEVELAND, OF THINK VIDEO/LANE COMMUNITY CABLE TELEVISION, AND I,-HAVE-PUT TOGETHER A 28-MINUTE INTRODUCTORY VIDEO FOR USE PRIOR TO THE-OUTREACH-SESSIONS, OR AS A STAND-ALONE INTRODUCTION TO EXPLORING DEEP-SPACE.------ THE MATERIAL IS SUITABLE FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS, BUT PARTICULARLY-SUITABLE-FOR ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.------ WE START WITH A BRIEF-INTRODUCTION-TO THE EMPTINESS OF SPACE BY TAKING AN IMAGINARY FLIGHT UPWARD FROM-EARTH,-NOTING THE RESULTS AND REQUIREMENTS OF LEAVING THE ATMOSPHERE AND-RUNNING-OUT OF AIR.---- NEXT WE COVER, USING MODELS, THE VOCABULARY OF MOON, PLANET, STAR/SUN,-SOLAR-SYSTEM, NEBULA, GALAXY, AND UNIVERSE.------ THEN WE CREATE A SCALE-MODEL-OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND ON A REAL FOOTBALL FIELD, AN ACTIVITY-YOU-CAN DUPLICATE.----------- FINALLY WE EXPLORE THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF LIGHT, INTRODUCING VIEWERS TO-THE-TERM "PHOTONS", AND NOTING THAT TO "SEE" ANYTHING WE NEED A SOURCE OF-PHOTONS-AND A DETECTOR OF PHOTONS (STARS AND OUR EYES).------ WE TIE THE WHOLE-PROGRAM-TOGETHER WITH A FINAL DEMONSTRATION WITH A FLASHLIGHT TO SHOW HOW-PHOTONS-FROM A DISTANT SOURCE SPREAD OUT, THUS WHY OBJECTS IN DEEP SPACE ARE SO-DIM,-SO HARD TO EXPLORE.----------- THE ACTUAL CLASSROOM OUTREACH PROGRAM THEN GIVES THE STUDENTS THE-OPPORTUNITIES-TO EXPLORE THE COLLECTION/DETECTION/MEASURING TECHNOLOGIES (TELESCOPES-AND-CCD CAMERAS) AND INCLUDES COMPUTER LABS WHERE ACTUAL RESEARCH CAN BE-DONE.----------- WHEN YOU CONTACT-ME TO SCHEDULE YOUR OUTREACH SESSION, I'LL MAIL YOU A-PREP-VIDEO ALONG WITH SEVERAL WORKSHEETS AND ANSWER KEYS TO COMPLEMENT THE-VIDEO.------ I'LL PICK UP THE VIDEO WHEN-I COME TO YOUR CLASSROOM.------ THERE IS NO-COST-FOR THE VIDEO, BUT WE DO NEED IT RETURNED.------------------- RESPONSES HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE FROM ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE-SCHOOLERS.------ MOST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE FELT THAT THE VIDEO WAS TOO SIMPLISTIC-FOR-THEM, ALTHOUGH SOME HAVE COMMENTED THAT THE CONCEPTS/OVERVIEW HAVE BEEN-VERY-HELPFUL.------------------- OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE OVERVIEW OF VAST DISTANCES,-HIERARCHY/VOCABULARY-OF TYPES OF OBJECTS, AND INITIAL EXPOSURE TO CONCEPT OF PHOTONS FOR THE-TECHNOLOGY-PROGRAM, AS WE DON'T HAVE TIME WITHIN THE CLASS TO COVER THESE-TOPICS.------ FOR EXAMPLE, THE STUDENTS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A-SOLAR-SYSTEM AND A GALAXY, FUNCTIONALLY, IN APPEARANCE, AND IN SCALE.------------------- IF YOU DON'T WISH TO GO THIS ROUTE OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET THE-VIDEO-MAILED TO YOU, I CAN ATTACH A BASIC VOCABULARY/DISTANCE SCALES INFO-SHEET-TO AN E-MAIL MESSAGE TO YOU, OR YOU CAN FIND THIS DOCUMENT AT THE-FRIENDS-OF PMO WEB SITE.------------------- WE WILL ALSO BE CREATING A VIDEO THAT DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF FITSVIEW-AND-AIP4WIN IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE.------ THIS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AS-FOLLOW-UP-MATERIALS FOR STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PURSUING A RESEARCH PROJECT USING-DIGITAL-IMAGES OF THE SKY.------------------------------------- SOLAR VIEWING:----------------------- WE NOW HAVE A STANDARD SOLAR FILTER FOR THE 6" TELESCOPE THAT I BRING-TO-CLASSROOMS, SO IF THE SKY IS CLEAR, THERE IS POTENTIALLY THE-OPPORTUNITY-TO VIEW SUNSPOTS.------ WE CAN SET UP THE TELESCOPE OUTSIDE BEFORE OR-AFTER-CLASS OR DURING LUNCH OR RECESS.------ THIS IS NOT AN H-ALPHA FILTER-LIKE-WE HAVE AT PINE MOUNTAIN THAT SHOWS THE SOLAR PROMINENCES, BUT THE-STANDARD-FILTER STILL OFFERS VERY INTERESTING VIEWS OF THE SOLAR "SURFACE-"FEATURES.------ QUEING-UP TO VIEW THROUGH THE TELESCOPE TAKES TIME, SO THIS USUALLY-DOESN'T-WORK WELL DURING A CLASS PERIOD AS TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE LEFT IDLE, BUT-IS-CERTAINLY SUITABLE AS A SUPPLEMENTAL BEFORE/AFTER CLASS/SCHOOL ACTIVITY.-------------------------------------------------------------- REQUESTS FOR SKY VIEWING IN EVENING:----------------------- OCCASIONALLY SCHOOLS REQUEST AN EVENING SKY OBSERVING PROGRAM IN-CONJUNCTION-WITH THE CLASSROOM OUTREACH.------ THIS MAY BE FEASIBLE, WORKING WITH-YOUR-LOCAL ASTRONOMY CLUB/ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, OR WITH ANY OTHER LOCAL-PEOPLE-WHO CAN BRING LARGE TELESCOPES.------ WE CAN SET UP THE PORTABLE CCD-CAMERA-ON A TABLE OUTSIDE, AND STUDENTS HAVE A GREAT TIME TAKING ACTUAL IMAGES-OF-SOME OF THE LARGER OBJECTS IN THE SKY, SUCH AS GALAXIES, STAR CLUSTERS,-AND-NEBULAS.------ WE CAN DISCUSS THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR EACH REQUEST-SPECIFICALLY,-AS RESOURCES VARY CONSIDERABLY AROUND THE STATE.----------------------------------------------- VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) SUN-EARTH-MOON (SEM) PROJECT:----------------------- OREGON RESEARCH INSTITUTE (ORI), IN EUGENE, HAS CREATED A VR PROGRAM-WHERE-THE USER CAN "FLY" HIS/HER CRAFT AROUND, ABOVE, AND BELOW THE SUN,-EARTH,-AND MOON (OTHER PLANETS MAY BE ADDED LATER).------ THE GOAL IS FOR THE-USER-TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE MOTIONS, ORIENTATIONS, AND VIEWS-OF THESE OBJECTS-BY-BEING ABLE TO GAIN A WIDE VARIETY OF PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVES NOT NORMALLY-AVAILABLE.------ EXPLORATIONS INCLUDE PHASES OF THE MOON AND THE ORBITS AND PERIODS OF-THE-EARTH AND MOON AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE POSITION OF THE-SUN.------ THIS PROGRAM, CALLED SEM, IS FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF-EDUCATION.------ ORI PRIME INVESTIGATOR, DR. DEAN INMAN, WROTE-THE GRANT AS A PROGRAM-DESIGNED-TO HELP ORTHOPEDICALLY IMPAIRED (OI) STUDENTS DO SCIENCE LABS THAT THEY-ORDINARILY-WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS.---- WHEN I SAW THE SOFTWARE IN EARLY SUMMER,--002, I WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK-THAT-NON-OI STUDENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO PUT THESE EXPLORATIONS TO GOOD-USE,-AND ALSO NOTED THAT THE SOFTWARE SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE MANY OF THE ODE'S-EARTH-IN-SPACE-BENCHMARKS.----------- I AM NOW WORKING WITH ORI TO DEVELOP TEACHER AND STUDENT MATERIALS FOR-USE-OF THE SEM PROGRAM, AND WILL BE INTRODUCING SEM IN MANY OF MY-OUTREACH-CLASSES.------ DR. INMAN AND I WILL BE LOOKING FOR TEACHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN-COLLABORATING-TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF SEM, COMPARING HOW STUDENTS LEARN WITH-CONVENTIONAL-STRATEGIES VERSUS SEM, FOR BOTH OI-AND REGULAR STUDENTS.----------- THE SOFTWARE IS FREE AND IS AVAILABLE EITHER AS A DOWNLOAD OFF THE WEB-FROM------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OR FROM A CD-ROM-THAT ORI CAN SEND YOU.------------ FED ED HAS ALSO FUNDED AVAILABILITY-OF-HIGH VIDEO PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS FROM ORI FOR CLASSROOMS WISHING TO-PARTICIPATE.------ PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING, WHETHER OR-NOT-YOU HAVE OI STUDENTS.--------------------------------------------------------------- RESEARCH PROJECTS:------------------------------------------------------------------ INQUIRY-BASED RESEARCH-PROJECTS FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS:----------- DIGITAL DATA CAN BE USED BY STUDENTS OF ALL AGES.------ HERE ARE SOME-SUGGESTED-PROJECTS THAT WE CAN ASSIST YOU TO IMPLEMENT IN YOUR CLASSROOM.------ DEPENDING-ON STUDENT ACADEMIC LEVELS, YOU COULD USE/ADAPT SEVERAL PROJECTS AT A-WIDE-VARIETY OF GRADE LEVELS.---- THE PROJECTS CAN BEGIN AS INQUIRIES AFTER VIEWING SOME INITIAL DIGITAL-IMAGES-OF THE SKY (OR VIEWING THE REAL SKY FOR THAT MATTER!)------ IF YOU COME-UP-WITH YOUR OWN PROJECT, WE CAN ASSIST YOU WITH DATA AND DATA ANALYSIS-SOFTWARE.------ WE CAN DEMONSTRATE A BASIC PROJECT LISTED BELOW DURING OUTREACH AND CAN-THEN-WALK YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH THE PROJECT IN YOUR COMPUTER LAB.-------------------------------- A.---- HOW MANY STARS (HOW MANY GALAXIES)?---- STARTING FROM A RUDIMENTARY COUNTING EXERCISE, STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE-IMAGES-FROM VARIOUS AREAS OF THE SKY AND IMAGES TAKEN WITH A VARIETY OF-EXPOSURE-TIMES.------ QUESTIONS CAN BE GENERATED CONCERNING DISTRIBUTION OF-OBJECTS,-TYPES OF-OBJECTS, AND HOW MUCH OF WHAT'S OUT THERE WE ARE REALLY ABLE-TO-SEE, WHY AND WHY NOT.------ THIS IS A VERY OPEN-ENDED PROJECT THAT CAN-BE-A REAL EYE-OPENER TO THE VASTNESS OF SPACE AND THE NATURE OF HOW-SCIENCE-IS DONE AND IS VERY SUITABLE FOR LOWER ELEMENTARY GRADE LEVELS.-------------------------------- B.---- DO ANY OBJECTS SHIFT POSITION IN THE SKY?---- THIS INVOLVES ASTROMETRIC (POSITIONAL) MEASUREMENTS, OVER A PERIOD OF-TIME.------ STARTING BY "BLINKING" (COMPARING) IMAGES OF-THE SAME AREA OF SKY-OVER-ONE-OR MORE NIGHTS, STUDENTS-CAN SEARCH FOR OBJECTS THAT SHIFT RELATIVE-POSITION-AND THEN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE SHIFT OBSERVED.------ STUDENTS CAN-DERIVE-THE BASIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISTANCE AND PARALLACTIC SHIFT AND THUS-SORT-OUT SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS VERSUS GALACTIC OBJECTS, DISCOVER ASTEROIDS,-AND-CAN BEGIN TO SORT OUT THE VARIOUS PLANETS AT VARIOUS DISTANCES AND-APPROXIMATE-THE ORBITAL RADII.---- SEE THE ASTROMETRIC PROJECT, INITIATED BY SILVERTON HIGH SCHOOL-TEACHER,-RAY KASER, DESCRIBED AS THE COMPUTER LAB OPTION IN THE CONTENTS OF-OUTREACH-SESSIONS SECTION ABOVE.-------------------- ANOTHER ASTROMETRIC PROJECT INVOLVES THE SEARCH FOR ASTEROIDS.------ THIS-IS AN AUTHENTIC RESEARCH PROJECT WITH POTENTIALLY VERY USEFUL RESULTS-(SAVING-EARTH!).------ STUDENTS CAN REQUEST DATA OR CAN SCAN ARCHIVED-DATA.------ BEST DONE WITH RICHARD BERRY'S AIP4WIN IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE, WHICH-WHEN-COMBINED WITH A DIGITAL DATABASE, WILL ALLOW THE USER TO ACCURATELY-DETERMINE-COORDINATES OF ANY CANDIDATES.------ DATA CAN THEN BE COMPARED WITH-LIST-OF KNOWN OBJECTS COMPILED BY LOWELL OBSERVATORY, AND IF OBJECT IS TRULY-A-NEW DISCOVERY, THE DISCOVERER MAY PARTICIPATE IN THE NAMING OF THE-OBJECT.-------------------------------- C.---- WHY ARE SOME OBJECTS BRIGHTER THAN OTHERS?---- THIS INVOLVES PHOTOMETRIC (BRIGHTNESS) MEASUREMENTS AND LEADS TO-MEASUREMENT-OF DISTANCES, TEMPERATURES, SIZES, AND BRINGS UP ISSUES OF INSTRUMENT-CALIBRATION.------ AT THE BASIC LEVEL, STUDENTS CAN INTUITIVELY CONCEPTUALIZE THE-RELATIONSHIPS-AND CAN BEGIN TO CHARACTERIZE AND CLASSIFY OBJECTS IN THE SKY.----------- WE HAVE ARCHIVED SETS OF DATA OF STARS OF SEVERAL CONSTELLATIONS, WHICH-CAN-BE MEASURED FOR RELATIVE BRIGHTNESSES.---- AT MORE ADVANCED LEVELS, WE CAN FURNISH IMAGES FILTERED IN VARIOUS-COLORS-(BVR) WHICH WOULD LEAD TO MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE FROM THE PLANCK-BLACKBODY-CURVE AND ULTIMATELY TO CONSTRUCTION OF AN H-R DIAGRAM AND DETERMINING-STELLAR-AGE.---------------------------------------------------------------REQUEST OR DOWNLOAD DATA (IMAGES OF THE SKY):----------------------- ARCHIVED DATA CAN BE "FTPD" (WE LIKE WS-FTP SOFTWARE TO DO THIS) OR-"TIMBUKTUD-"(TIMBUKTU SOFTWARE FROM WWW.NETOPIA.COM) FROM---------------------------------- IP
