SMITH AND THE INVISIBLE HAND--------------------------------------- BY HELEN JOYCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...EVERY INDIVIDUAL NECESSARILY LABOURS TO RENDER THE ANNUAL REVENUE- OF THE SOCIETY AS GREAT AS HE CAN. HE GENERALLY, INDEED, NEITHER- INTENDS TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST, NOR KNOWS HOW MUCH HE- IS PROMOTING IT. BY PREFERRING THE SUPPORT OF DOMESTIC TO THAT- OF FOREIGN INDUSTRY, HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN SECURITY; AND BY-DIRECTING- THAT INDUSTRY IN SUCH A MANNER AS ITS PRODUCE MAY BE OF THE GREATEST- VALUE, HE INTENDS ONLY HIS OWN GAIN, AND HE IS IN THIS, AS IN MANY-OTHER- CASES, LED BY AN---- INVISIBLE HAND--- TO PROMOTE-AN END WHICH WAS NO PART- OF HIS INTENTION. NOR IS IT ALWAYS THE WORSE FOR THE SOCIETY THAT IT-WAS- NO PART OF IT. BY PURSUING HIS OWN INTEREST HE FREQUENTLY PROMOTES- THAT OF THE SOCIETY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN WHEN HE REALLY INTENDS TO- PROMOTE IT. I HAVE NEVER KNOWN MUCH GOOD DONE BY THOSE WHO- AFFECTED TO TRADE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IN THIS PASSAGE, TAKEN FROM HIS 1776 BOOK-"AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF THE WEALTH OF NATIONS-"ADAM SMITH SET OUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH HE FELT ECONOMIC SOCIETY-OPERATED. EACH INDIVIDUAL STRIVES TO BECOME WEALTHY "INTENDING-ONLY HIS OWN GAIN" BUT TO THIS END HE MUST EXCHANGE WHAT HE-OWNS OR PRODUCES WITH OTHERS WHO SUFFICIENTLY VALUE WHAT HE HAS-TO OFFER; IN THIS WAY, BY DIVISION OF LABOUR AND A FREE MARKET,-PUBLIC INTEREST IS ADVANCED.---- SMITH IS OFTEN REGARDED AS THE FATHER OF ECONOMICS, AND HIS WRITINGS-HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY INFLUENTIAL. NOWADAYS, "INVISIBLE HAND" EXPLANATIONS-ARE INVOKED TO EXPLAIN ALL SORTS OF PHENOMENA, FROM SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS-TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. IN THE MODERN CONTEXT, MATHEMATICIANS-STUDY "INVISIBLE HAND" PROCESSES-AS PART OF GAME THEORY, THE BRANCH-OF-MATHEMATICS THAT DEALS WITH PAYOFFS AND STRATEGIES (SEE------------------------------------------------------GAME-THEORY AND THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS----)-IN ISSUE 13 OF--- PLUS----.---- SMITH WAS PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS, AND SAW THE-"INVISIBLE HAND" AS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH A BENEVOLENT GOD-ADMINISTERED A UNIVERSE IN WHICH HUMAN HAPPINESS WAS-MAXIMISED. HE MADE IT CLEAR-IN HIS WRITINGS THAT QUITE-CONSIDERABLE STRUCTURE WAS REQUIRED IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE--INVISIBLE HAND MECHANISM COULD WORK EFFICIENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE,-PROPERTY RIGHTS MUST BE STRONG, AND THERE MUST BE WIDESPREAD-ADHERENCE TO MORAL NORMS, SUCH AS PROHIBITIONS AGAINST THEFT AND-MISREPRESENTATION. THEFT WAS,-TO SMITH, THE WORST CRIME OF ALL,-EVEN THOUGH A POOR MAN STEALING FROM A RICH MAN MAY INCREASE-OVERALL HAPPINESS.-HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT-IS TO DEFEND THE RICH FROM THE POOR.---- HERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY SMITH IMAGINED THE UNIVERSE OPERATES:-------------- THERE IS A BENEVOLENT DEITY WHO ADMINISTERS THE WORLD IN SUCH-A WAY AS TO MAXIMISE HUMAN HAPPINESS.------IN ORDER TO DO THIS HE HAS CREATED HUMANS WITH A NATURE-THAT LEADS THEM TO ACT IN A CERTAIN WAY.----- THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT IS PRETTY MUCH PERFECT, AND EVERYONE IS- ABOUT EQUALLY HAPPY. IN PARTICULAR, THE RICH ARE NO HAPPIER THAN THE POOR.----- ALTHOUGH THIS MEANS WE SHOULD ALL BE HAPPY WITH OUR LOT IN LIFE,-OUR NATURE (WHICH, REMEMBER, WAS CREATED BY GOD FOR THE PURPOSE-OF MAXIMISING HAPPINESS) LEADS US TO THINK THAT WE WOULD BE-HAPPIER IF WE WERE WEALTHIER.----- THIS IS A GOOD THING, BECAUSE IT LEADS US TO STRUGGLE TO BECOME- WEALTHIER, THUS INCREASING THE SUM TOTAL OF HUMAN HAPPINESS VIA-THE MECHANISMS OF EXCHANGE AND DIVISION OF-LABOUR.---------- IT IS CLEAR WHY SMITH SAYS THAT MORAL NORMS ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCH-A SYSTEM TO WORK - IN ORDER-FOR EXCHANGE TO PROCEED,- CONTRACTS MUST BE ENFORCEABLE, PEOPLE MUST HAVE GOOD-ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES-AVAILABLE, AND THE RULE-OF LAW MUST HOLD.--------- THE MODERN "INVISIBLE HAND---------" NOWADAYS, SOMETHING MUCH MORE GENERAL-IS MEANT BY THE EXPRESSION-"INVISIBLE HAND". AN INVISIBLE HAND PROCESS IS ONE IN WHICH-THE OUTCOME TO BE EXPLAINED IS PRODUCED IN A DECENTRALISED WAY,-WITH NO EXPLICIT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE-ACTING AGENTS. THE SECOND ESSENTIAL-COMPONENT IS THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT INTENTIONAL. THE AGENTS' AIMS-ARE NOT COORDINATED NOR IDENTICAL WITH THE ACTUAL OUTCOME, WHICH IS-A BYPRODUCT OF THOSE AIMS. THE PROCESS SHOULD WORK EVEN-WITHOUT THE AGENTS HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT. THIS IS WHY THE PROCESS-IS CALLED INVISIBLE.---- THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE INVISIBLE HAND IS MOST OFTEN ASSUMED-TO WORK IS THE FREE MARKET.- ADAM SMITH ASSUMED THAT CONSUMERS CHOOSE FOR THE LOWEST PRICE,-AND THAT ENTREPRENEURS CHOOSE FOR THE HIGHEST RATE OF PROFIT.-HE ASSERTED THAT BY THUS MAKING THEIR EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT DEMAND KNOWN THROUGH-MARKET PRICES, CONSUMERS "DIRECTED" ENTREPRENEURS' INVESTMENT MONEY TO-THE MOST PROFITABLE INDUSTRY. REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE INDUSTRY -PRODUCING THE GOODS MOST HIGHLY-VALUED BY CONSUMERS, SO-IN GENERAL ECONOMIC WELL-BEING IS INCREASED.---- ONE EXTREMELY POSITIVE ASPECT OF A MARKET-BASED-ECONOMY IS THAT IT FORCES PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT-OTHER PEOPLE WANT. SMITH-SAW THIS AS A LARGE PART OF-WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT-THE INVISIBLE HAND MECHANISM.-HE IDENTIFIED TWO WAYS TO-OBTAIN-THE HELP AND CO-OPERATION OF OTHER PEOPLE, UPON WHICH WE ALL DEPEND CONSTANTLY.-THE FIRST WAY IS TO APPEAL TO THE BENEVOLENCE AND GOODWILL OF OTHERS.- TO DO THIS A-PERSON MUST OFTEN ACT IN A SERVILE AND FAWNING WAY, WHICH SMITH-FOUND REPULSIVE, AND HE CLAIMED IT GENERALLY MEETS-WITH VERY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE SECOND WAY IS TO-APPEAL INSTEAD TO OTHER PEOPLE'S SELF-INTEREST. IN ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS QUOTES:----------------- MAN HAS ALMOST CONSTANT OCCASION FOR THE HELP OF HIS-BRETHREN, AND IT IS IN VAIN FOR HIM TO-EXPECT IT FROM THEIR-BENEVOLENCE ONLY. HE WILL BE MORE-LIKELY TO PREVAIL IF-HE CAN-INTEREST THEIR SELF-LOVE IN HIS FAVOUR, AND SHOW THEM THAT-IT IS FOR-THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE TO DO FOR HIM WHAT HE REQUIRES OF THEM.-WHOEVER OFFERS TO ANOTHER A BARGAIN OF ANY KIND, PROPOSES TO DO-THIS. GIVE ME WHAT I WANT, AND YOU SHALL HAVE THIS WHICH YOU WANT, IS-THE MEANING OF EVERY SUCH OFFER; AND IT IS THE MANNER THAT WE-OBTAIN FROM ONE ANOTHER THE FAR GREATER PART OF THOSE GOOD OFFICES WHICH-WE STAND IN NEED OF. IT IS NOT FROM THE BENEVOLENCE OF THE-BUTCHER, THE BREWER, OR THE BAKER THAT WE EXPECT OUR DINNER, BUT FROM-THEIR REGARD TO THEIR OWN INTEREST. WE ADDRESS OURSELVES, NOT-TO THEIR HUMANITY BUT TO THEIR SELF-LOVE.----------------------- FOR SMITH, TO PROPOSE AN EXCHANGE IS TO ATTEMPT TO SHOW ANOTHER THAT WHAT-YOU CAN DO, OR WHAT YOU HAVE, CAN BE OF USE TO THE OTHER. WHEN YOU CARRY-OUT THE EXCHANGE, IT MEANS THE OTHER PERSON-RECOGNISES THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO OR THAT WHAT YOU-HAVE IS OF VALUE. THIS IS WHY SO MUCH OF A PERSON'S SELF-ESTEEM IS BOUND UP-IN THEIR JOB - A WELL-PAID JOB IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SIGN THAT OTHERS VALUE YOUR-CONTRIBUTION-AND FIND IT WORTH EXCHANGING THEIR OWN RESOURCES FOR.-------- HOW WISE IS THE INVISIBLE-HAND?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WITH PERMISSION FROM: THE WARREN J. SAMUELS PORTRAIT-COLLECTION AT DUKE UNIVERSITY----------------------------------------------------------------- THE THEORY OF THE INVISIBLE HAND IS CERTAINLY PERSUASIVE, AND ITS SIMPLICITY-IS ALSO VERY ATTRACTIVE. NO DOUBT EVERY READER CAN SEE THAT IT DESCRIBES-THE WAY THAT THINGS REALLY WORK ON MANY OCCASIONS, AND, WHETHER WE- FIND IT PALATABLE OR NOT, WE PROBABLY ALL RECOGNISE THE TRUTH OF SMITH'S ASSERTION THAT- PAYING FOR YOUR DINNER IS A MORE RELIABLE WAY TO GET IT THAN-APPEALING TO THE BENEVOLENCE OF OTHERS.---- BUT, EVEN ASSUMING ALL THE CORRECT CONDITIONS, DOES THE INVISIBLE HAND THEORY-REALLY LEAD TO THE MAXIMISATION OF HUMAN ECONOMIC WELLBEING-IN SOME SENSE, AS SMITH ASSERTS?-THIS IS WHERE MATHEMATICS, IN THE FORM OF GAME THEORY, CAN PROVIDE US WITH-SOME INSIGHTS.-------- THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA--------- THE "PRISONER'S DILEMMA--IS A VERY FAMOUS "PARADOX" IN GAME THEORY.-IT DESCRIBES TWO PEOPLE IN A SIMPLE SITUATION,-ACTING IN AN INFORMED MANNER,-BOTH ATTEMPTING TO MAXIMISE-THEIR WELLBEING, AND YET MAKING-CHOICES THAT LEAD TO-AN- UNNECESSARILY POOR OUTCOME FOR BOTH.----- TWO PEOPLE, WHO ARE SUSPECTED-OF BEING ACCOMPLICES IN A CRIME,- ARE HELD PRISONER IN SEPARATE, NON-COMMUNICATING CELLS.-THE POLICE VISIT EACH PRISONER, AND TELL BOTH THAT-- IF NEITHER CONFESSES, EACH WILL BE SENTENCED T-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------O THREE YEARS.---- WHAT SHOULD A PRISONER IN THIS SITUATION DO?- SUPPOSE THAT THE OTHER PRISONER DOESN'T-CONFESS. THEN THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO CONFESS,- AND GO FREE. EVEN IF THE OTHER PRISONER-DOES CONFESS, IT WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE DONE LIKEWISE- - AT LEAST THE SENTENCE WILL BE LOWER.-BOTH PRISONERS WILL REASON THUS, SO BOTH WILL CONFESS AND-END UP SERVING SENTENCES OF THREE YEARS - EVEN-THOUGH, IF BOTH HAD REMAINED SILENT, BOTH-WOULD HAVE SERVED- SENTENCES OF ONLY TWO YEARS.-----IT-MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHAT THE RELEVANCE OF THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA-IS TO SMITH'S THEORY OF THE INVISIBLE HAND. IN FACT, IT HAS A NUMBER OF-IMPLICATIONS FOR ECONOMIC BEHAVIOUR.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA------------------------------------------------------------------ THE TEMPTATION TO DEFAULT--------- WE CAN THINK-OF THE PRISONERS AS BEING ASKED TO DECIDE-WHETHER TO KEEP A CONTRACT THEY HAVE MADE WITH EACH OTHER-(REMAIN SILENT) OR TO DEFAULT (CONFESS AND BETRAY THE OTHER).- SIMILAR CHOICES HAVE TO BE MADE ALL THE TIME IN ECONOMIC SOCIETY.-WHEN TWO PEOPLE FREELY AGREE TO EXCHANGE- GOODS OR SERVICES TO THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT, EACH MUST-DECIDE WHETHER TO TRY TO CHEAT THE OTHER BY DEFAULTING, OR HANDING- OVER COUNTERFEIT GOODS,-OR WHETHER TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND RISK THE-OTHER PARTY DEFAULTING. OBVIOUSLY, BOTH PARTIES- ARE BETTER OFF IF NEITHER DEFAULT-THAN IF BOTH DEFAULT - AFTER ALL, WE SUPPOSE THEY- WILLINGLY CONTRACTED WITH EACH-OTHER - BUT EACH WOULD LIKE TO GET-SOMETHING FOR-NOTHING, AND EACH IS-AFRAID THE OTHER WILL FEEL THE SAME. THE RESULT MAY WELL BE-THAT THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO CARRY OUT THE EXCHANGE-AS ARRANGED, AND BOTH LOSE OUT.---- THE REASON WE DON'T SEE THIS BEHAVIOUR TOO OFTEN IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A- SOCIETY WHERE COURTS CAN ENFORCE CONTRACTS. THIS REDUCES THE FEAR OF--THE OTHER PARTY DEFAULTING, AND MAKES IT EASIER TO HAND OVER GOODS-AHEAD OF-RECEIVING WHATEVER IS TO BE EXCHANGED FOR THEM.-IN ILLEGAL-EXCHANGES, FOR EXAMPLE,-RECEIVING STOLEN GOODS, DEFAULT IS MORE COMMON, AND RATHER DIFFICULT- FOR CRIMINALS TO GUARD AGAINST.---- ENFORCING LAWS OF CONTRACT REQUIRES COOPERATION AND RESOURCES FROM SOMEONE- ELSE - IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES, THE-COURTS ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE.- BUT COURTS AND PRISONS AND POLICE--COST MONEY AND MOST-OF THE COSTS FALL ON PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT PARTY- TO THE-CONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE- -WHO ARE THEREFORE PAYING FOR A SERVICE THAT DOESN'T- DIRECTLY BENEFIT THEMSELVES.-SUCH COURTS FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF "PUBLIC GOOD-" - WE-ARE ALL BETTER OFF IN A SOCIETY-WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS UPHELD - BUT ARE NOT CREATED AND MAINTAINED -BY ANY INVISIBLE HAND MECHANISM.-COURTS ARE SET UP DELIBERATELY TO CARRY OUT A PUBLIC GOOD;- AND, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS WORK-THE WAY THEY ARE INTENDED TO, THERE IS NOTHING- UNINTENDED ABOUT THEIR USE TO ENFORCE-CONTRACTS.-------- SUBSIDY-SEEKING--------- IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, THERE IS A STRONG TEMPTATION-FOR "SPECIAL-INTEREST" GROUPS TO FORM AND-LOBBY THE- GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE-TAX-PAYERS'-MONEY TO THE GROUP-IN THE FORM OF SUBSIDIES.- POLITICIANS FIND THE PROSPECT OF BUYING THE LOYALTY OF THE-GROUP ATTRACTIVE,-AND THE GROUP SEES THE PROSPECT-OF GETTING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY FOR NOTHING.- CLEARLY, EVERYONE-WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF NO ONE SOUGHT SUBSIDIES - BY DEFINITION,-SUBSIDIES ARE ONLY NEEDED FOR UNPROFITABLE ACTIVITIES, THAT IS,-ACTIVITIES THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT VALUE SUFFICIENTLY-TO PAY THEIR OWN MONEY FOR. HOWEVER,-IF OTHER PEOPLE SEEK AND GAIN SUBSIDIES, ANYONE WHO-DOESN'T-BOTHER TRYING TO DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES-WILL END UP SUBSIDISING OTHERS WHILE RECEIVING NO SUBSIDIES-THEMSELVES. THIS FEAR MAY FORCE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE-TO SPEND THEIR TIME LOBBYING THE GOVERNMENT- FOR SUBSIDIES, RATHER THAN-SIMPLY ENGAGING IN MORE PROFITABLE ACTIVITIES - A CLASSIC EXAMPLE-OF THE-PRISONER'S DILEMMA, AND ONE OVER WHICH NO COURT HAS JURISDICTION.---- A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION OCCURS REGARDING MONOPOLIES.-SINCE PRETTY MUCH EVERY PRODUCER IS A CONSUMER, IT IS PROBABLY TO--EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT OVERALL IF NO PRODUCERS-ATTEMPT TO RAISE PRICES BY- MONOPOLISING THEIR MARKET; HOWEVER, ATTEMPTING-TO ENFORCE A MONOPOLY CAN BE VERY-ATTRACTIVE TO INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS. SMITH RATHER SARDONICALLY OBSERVED THAT------------------ "PEOPLE OF THE SAME TRADE- SELDOM MEET TOGETHER EVEN FOR MERRIMENT AND DIVERSION,- BUT THE CONVERSATION ENDS IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PUBLIC OR SOME-CONTRIVANCE TO RAISE PRICES.----------------------------" ARROW'S THEOREM--------- AS EXPLAINED IN THE--------------------------------------------------------EDITORIAL-----OF ISSUE 13 OF--- PLUS----, ARROW'S IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM SAYS THAT,-IN A CERTAIN SENSE,- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A CONSISTENT GROUP PREFERENCE-BY AGGREGATING INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES.-IT IS NORMALLY STATED IN TERMS OF VOTES AND ELECTIONS,-AND, IN THIS FORMAT, SAYS THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL-VOTERS' PREFERENCES TO DECIDE WHAT IS "THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE".-EVERY VOTING SYSTEM IN CURRENT USE THROWS UP ANOMALIES, SUCH-AS "FLIP-FLOPS", WHICH OCCUR WHEN A THIRD CANDIDATE ENTERS THE RACE-AND OVERTURNS-THE GROUP PREFERENCE BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES (THINK OF-RALPH NADER IN CALIFORNIA, SPLITTING AL GORE'S VOTE AND HANDING GEORGE-BUSH THE ELECTION).-------- THE "WILL OF THE PEOPLE---------" AGAIN, THE RELEVANCE TO ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC GOODS IS NOT IMMEDIATELY-OBVIOUS - UNTIL YOU RECALL THAT AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE INVISIBLE-HAND PROCESS IS THAT PRODUCERS RESPOND TO AN SINGLE SIGNAL THAT IS- MEANT TO BE AN AGGREGATE OF ALL SIGNALS-BY CONSUMERS. ARROW'S THEOREM IS OFTEN INTERPRETED AS-SAYING THAT THERE IS NO CONSISTENT-WAY TO AGGREGATE THE PREFERENCES OF INDIVIDUALS TO GIVE A SINGLE-PREFERENCE WHICH CAN BE-REGARDED AS THE PREFERENCE OF SOCIETY- -OR "THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE".---- AN ECONOMIC VERSION OF THE FLIP-FLOP COULD OCCUR IF A MAJORITY-OF CUSTOMERS WOULD PREFER TO BUY PRODUCT X TO PRODUCT Y,-BUT SOME OF THAT MAJORITY ACTUALLY-LIKE PRODUCT Z EVEN BETTER (THE EQUIVALENT OF SPLITTING THE VOTE);- THE PRODUCER MAY END UP PRODUCING-PRODUCT Y EVEN THOUGH MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED PRODUCT X,-AND PRESUMABLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PROFITABLE TO PRODUCE IT.-IF THIS HAPPENS, THEN-THE INVISIBLE HAND CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE- WORKED TO MAXIMISE ECONOMIC WELLBEING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN A CENTRALISED SOCIETY A FEW INDIVIDUALS MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND EVERYONE'S MONEY AND DIRECT EVERYONE'S EFFORT.------------------------------------------------------------------ HOW FAR DOES THE INVISIBLE HAND REACH?--------- HOW ECONOMIC SYSTEMS WORK AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THEM-IS STILL VERY MUCH A LIVE AREA OF RESEARCH FOR ECONOMISTS.-MATHEMATICIANS ARE CURRENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF GAME- THEORY FOR ALL SORTS OF SOCIAL CHOICE, IN PARTICULAR, WHAT MEANING, IF ANY,-CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE EXPRESSIONS "THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE" AND-"THE PUBLIC GOOD".---- THE RESULTS OF SUCH ANALYSES WILL NOT BE THE ONLY FACTOR-IN DECIDING WHETHER SOCIETIES MOVE TOWARDS OR AWAY-FROM LAISSEZ-FAIRE ECONOMICS ("LAISSEZ-FAIRE" MEANS-"LET ALONE" AND IS SHORTHAND FOR LEAVING THINGS TO THE-INVISIBLE HAND).-POLITICAL WILL, WHETHER THE WORLD BECOMES MORE PEACEFUL OR LESS,-AND THE PRACTICALITY OF ANY ALTERNATIVES WILL ALSO BE FACTORS.-ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS TEND TO REQUIRE-MUCH MORE INTERVENTION AND MORE STRINGENT RULES.- IN THE REAL WORLD, SUCH RULES- AUTOMATICALLY INTRODUCE MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR-MISTAKES AND CORRUPTION, WHICH MIGHT MEAN THAT ANOTHER SYSTEM,-EVEN IF BETTER IN PRINCIPLE, WOULD BE WORSE IN PRACTICE.---- PERHAPS THE STRONGEST REASON FOR LEAVING THE ALLOCATION-OF EFFORT AND REWARD TO THE INVISIBLE HAND IS THAT-WHEN IT MISAPPROPRIATES-GOODS, IT IS LIKELY TO BE-ON A SMALL SCALE. MORE CENTRALISED METHODS OF ALLOCATING-GOODS ARE MORE-PRONE TO CORRUPTION AND-WASTE. SMITH DESCRIBED-PEOPLE GIVEN THE SPENDING OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY THUS:----------------- ..BEING THE MANAGERS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY-THAN OF THEIR OWN, IT CANNOT WELL BE EXPECTED-THAT THEY SHOULD WATCH OVER IT WITH THE SAME-ANXIOUS VIGILANCE WITH WHICH PARTNERS IN A-PRIVATE COPARTNERY FREQUENTLY WATCH OVER THEIR-OWN. LIKE THE STEWARDS OF A RICH MAN, THEY-... CONSIDER-ATTENTION TO SMALL MATTERS AS-NOT FOR THEIR MASTER'S-HONOUR AND VERY EASILY-GIVE THEMSELVES A DISPENSATION FROM HAVING IT.----------------------- IT IS USEFUL TO REMEMBER THE CONTEXT IN WHICH-SMITH DEVELOPED HIS THEORIES - THAT OF A HEAVILY PLANNED AND RATHER-DICTATORIAL SOCIETY, WHERE SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE ABOVE THE LAW-AND OTHERS WERE EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT ANY RIGHTS. IN A CENTRALISED SOCIETY-A FEW INDIVIDUALS MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND-EVERYONE'S MONEY-AND DIRECT EVERYONE'S EFFORT. AS SMITH SAID----------------- IT IS THE HIGHEST IMPERTINENCE AND PRESUMPTION, THEREFORE,-IN KINGS AND MINISTERS TO PRETEND TO WATCH OVER THE ECONOMY OF PRIVATE-PEOPLE, AND TO RESTRAIN THEIR EXPENSE...THEY ARE THEMSELVES ALWAYS, AND-WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE GREATEST SPENDTHRIFTS IN THE SOCIETY.------------------------ ABOUT THE AUTHOR------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HELEN JOYCE----- IS ONE OF THE ASSISTANT EDITORS ON PLUS MAGAZINE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
