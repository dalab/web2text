...every individual necessarily labours to render the annual
revenue  of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,
neither  intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much
he  is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that

of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and
by□directing  that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of
the greatest  value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in
this, as in many□other□ cases, led by an □□□□invisible hand□□□ to promote an
end which was no part  of his intention. Nor is it always the worse
for the society that it□was□ no part of it. By pursuing his own
interest he frequently promotes  that of the society more
effectually than when he really intends to  promote it. I have never
known much good done by those who  affected to trade for the public
good.

In this passage, taken from his 1776 book□"An Inquiry into the Nature
and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"□Adam Smith set out the mechanism
by which he felt economic society□operated. Each individual strives to
become wealthy "intending□only his own gain" but to this end he must
exchange what he□owns or produces with others who sufficiently value
what he has□to offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free
market,□public interest is advanced.
□□□
Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his
writings□have been enormously influential. Nowadays, "invisible hand"
explanations□are invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from
scientific progress□to environmental degradation. In the modern
context, mathematicians□study "invisible hand" processes as part of
Game Theory, the branch of□mathematics that deals with payoffs and
strategies (see□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Game□Theory and the Cuban Missile Crisis□□□□)□in Issue 13 of
□□□Plus□□□□.□□□□
Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the□"invisible hand" as the
mechanism by which a benevolent God□administered a universe in which
human happiness was□maximised. He made it clear in his writings that
quite□considerable structure was required in society before the

invisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,□property
rights must be strong, and there must be widespread□adherence to moral
norms, such as prohibitions against theft and□misrepresentation. Theft
was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,□even though a poor man stealing
from a rich man may increase□overall happiness.□He even went so far as
to say that the purpose of government□is to defend the rich from the
poor.
□□□
Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in such□a way
as to maximise human happiness.
□□□□
In order to do this he has created humans with a nature□that leads
them to act in a certain way.
□□□□
The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is

about equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than
the poor.
□□□□
Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in
life,□our nature (which, remember, was created by God for the
purpose□of maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would
be□happier if we were wealthier.
□□□□
This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become

wealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via□the
mechanisms of exchange and division of labour.
□□□□□□□□□
It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for such□a
system to work - in order for exchange to proceed,  contracts must be
enforceable, people must have good□access to information about the
products and services□available, and the rule of law must hold.
□□□□□□□□□The modern "Invisible Hand"□□□□□□□□□
Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the
expression□"invisible hand". An invisible hand process is one in
which□the outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised
way,□with no explicit agreements between the□acting agents. The second
essential□component is that the process is not intentional. The agents'
aims□are not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which
is□a byproduct of those aims. The process should work even□without the
agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the process□is called
invisible.
□□□
The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed□to work is
the free market.  Adam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the
lowest price,□and that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of
profit.□He asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient
demand known through□market prices, consumers "directed" entrepreneurs'
investment money to□the most profitable industry. Remember that this is
the industry  producing the goods most highly□valued by consumers, so in
general economic well-being is increased.
□□□
One extremely positive aspect of a market-based□economy is that it
forces people to think about what□other people want. Smith saw this as
a large part of□what was good about the invisible hand mechanism.□He
identified two ways to obtain□the help and co-operation of other
people, upon which we all depend constantly.□The first way is to appeal
to the benevolence and goodwill of others.  To do this a person must
often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smith□found repulsive,
and he claimed it generally meets□with very limited success. The second
way is to□appeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his
most famous quotes:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his□brethren, and
it is in vain for him to expect it from their□benevolence only. He
will be more likely to prevail if he can□interest their self-love in
his favour, and show them that it is for□their own advantage to do
for him what he requires of them.□Whoever offers to another a
bargain of any kind, proposes to do□this. Give me what I want, and
you shall have this which you want, is□the meaning of every such
offer; and it is the manner that we□obtain from one another the far
greater part of those good offices which□we stand in need of. It is
not from the benevolence of the□butcher, the brewer, or the baker
that we expect our dinner, but from□their regard to their own
interest. We address ourselves, not□to their humanity but to their
self-love.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
For Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that
what□you can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you
carry□out the exchange, it means the other person□recognises that what
you can do or that what you□have is of value. This is why so much of a
person's self-esteem is bound up□in their job - a well-paid job is

The theory of the invisible hand is certainly persuasive, and its
simplicity□is also very attractive. No doubt every reader can see that
it describes□the way that things really work on many occasions, and,
whether we  find it palatable or not, we probably all recognise the
truth of Smith's assertion that  paying for your dinner is a more
reliable way to get it than□appealing to the benevolence of others.
□□□
But, even assuming all the correct conditions, does the invisible hand
theory□really lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeing□in
some sense, as Smith asserts?□This is where mathematics, in the form of
Game Theory, can provide us with□some insights.
□□□□□□□□The Prisoner's Dilemma□□□□□□□□□
The "Prisoner's Dilemma" is a very famous "paradox" in Game Theory.□It
describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed
manner,□both attempting to maximise□their wellbeing, and yet making
choices that lead to an  unnecessarily poor outcome for both.
□□□□
Two people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime,  are
held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells.□The police visit
each prisoner, and tell both that □ if neither confesses, each will be
sentenced to two years in jail.□However, if exactly one prisoner
confesses, implicating each other, the one□who confesses will get off
scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn't  confess, will receive
a punitive sentence of five years.  If each confesses and implicates
the other, both will be  sentenced to three years.
□□□
What should a prisoner in this situation do?  Suppose that the other
prisoner doesn't□confess. Then the best course of action is to confess,

and go free. Even if the other prisoner□does confess, it will be better
to have done likewise -  at least the sentence will be lower.□Both
prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess and□end up serving
sentences of three years - even□though, if both had remained silent,
both would have served  sentences of only two years.
□□□
It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner's
Dilemma□is to Smith's theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a
number of□implications for economic behaviour.

□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The temptation to default□□□□□□□□□
We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decide□whether to keep
a contract they have made with each other□(remain silent) or to default
(confess and betray the other).  Similar choices have to be made all
the time in economic society.□When two people freely agree to exchange

goods or services to their mutual benefit, each must□decide whether to
try to cheat the other by defaulting, or handing  over counterfeit
goods,□or whether to act in good faith and risk the□other party
defaulting. Obviously, both parties  are better off if neither
default□than if both default - after all, we suppose they  willingly
contracted with each□other - but each would like to get□something for
nothing, and each is□afraid the other will feel the same. The result
may well be□that the parties are unable to carry out the exchange□as
arranged, and both lose out.
□□□
The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in
a  society where courts can enforce contracts. This reduces the fear of

the other party defaulting, and makes it easier to hand over
goods□ahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them.□In
illegal exchanges, for example,□receiving stolen goods, default is more
common, and rather difficult  for criminals to guard against.
□□□
Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from
someone  else - in democratic societies, the□courts on behalf of the
government and the people.  But courts and prisons and police  cost
money and most□of the costs fall on people who were not party  to the
contract in the first place -□who are therefore paying for a service
that doesn't  directly benefit themselves.□Such courts fall into the
category of "public good" -  we are all better off in a society□where
the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained □by any invisible hand mechanism.□Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a
public good;  and, although they may not always work□the way they are
intended to, there is nothing  unintended about their use to
enforce□contracts.
□□□□□□□□Subsidy-seeking□□□□□□□□□
In a democratic society, there is a strong temptation□for
"special-interest" groups to form and lobby the  government to provide
tax-payers'□money to the group in the form of subsidies.  Politicians
find the prospect of buying the loyalty of the□group attractive, and
the group sees the prospect□of getting other people's money for
nothing.  Clearly, everyone□would be better off if no one sought
subsidies - by definition,□subsidies are only needed for unprofitable
activities, that is,□activities that other people do not value
sufficiently□to pay their own money for. However,□if other people seek
and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn't□bother trying to do the same for
themselves□will end up subsidising others while receiving no
subsidies□themselves. This fear may force large numbers of people□to
spend their time lobbying the government  for subsidies, rather
than□simply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic
example□of the□Prisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has
jurisdiction.
□□□
A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.□Since pretty much
every producer is a consumer, it is probably to  everybody's benefit
overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by  monopolising their
market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be
very□attractive to individual producers. Smith rather sardonically
observed that
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
"People of the same trade  seldom meet together even for merriment
and diversion,  but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against
the public or some□contrivance to raise prices."
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Arrow's Theorem□□□□□□□□□
As explained in the□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Editorial□□□□□of Issue 13 of □□□Plus□□□□, Arrow's Impossibility
Theorem says that,□in a certain sense,  it is impossible to produce a
consistent group preference□by aggregating individual preferences.□It is
normally stated in terms of votes and elections,□and, in this format,
says that is impossible to use information about individual□voters'
preferences to decide what is "the will of the people".□Every voting
system in current use throws up anomalies, such□as "flip-flops", which
occur when a third candidate enters the race and overturns□the group
preference between the other two candidates (think of□Ralph Nader in
California, splitting Al Gore's vote and handing George□Bush the
election).
□□□□□□□□The "will of the people"□□□□□□□□□
Again, the relevance to allocation of public goods is not
immediately□obvious - until you recall that an essential part of the
invisible□hand process is that producers respond to an single signal
that is  meant to be an aggregate of all signals□by consumers. Arrow's
Theorem is often interpreted as□saying that there is no consistent□way
to aggregate the preferences of individuals to give a single□preference
which can be regarded as the preference of society -□or "the will of
the people".
□□□
An economic version of the flip-flop could occur if a majority□of
customers would prefer to buy Product X to Product Y,□but some of that
majority actually□like Product Z even better (the equivalent of
splitting the vote);  the producer may end up producing□Product Y even
though more people would have liked Product X,□and presumably it would
have been more profitable to produce it.□If this happens, then the
invisible hand cannot be said to have  worked to maximise economic
wellbeing.

How economic systems work and what can be done to improve them□is still
very much a live area of research for economists.□Mathematicians are
currently grappling with the implications of game  theory for all sorts
of social choice, in particular, what meaning, if any,□can be attached
to the expressions "the will of the people" and□"the public good".
□□□
The results of such analyses will not be the only factor□in deciding
whether societies move towards or away□from laissez-faire economics
("laissez-faire" means□"let alone" and is shorthand for leaving things
to the□invisible hand).□Political will, whether the world becomes more
peaceful or less,□and the practicality of any alternatives will also be
factors.□Alternative systems tend to require□much more intervention and
more stringent rules.  In the real world, such rules  automatically
introduce more and more opportunities for□mistakes and corruption,
which might mean that another system,□even if better in principle,
would be worse in practice.
□□□
Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocation□of effort and
reward to the invisible hand is that□when it misappropriates□goods, it
is likely to be□on a small scale. More centralised methods of
allocating□goods are more prone to corruption and waste. Smith
described□people given the spending of other people's money thus:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
..being the managers of other people's money□than of their own, it
cannot well be expected□that they should watch over it with the
same□anxious vigilance with which partners in a□private copartnery
frequently watch over their□own. Like the stewards of a rich man,
they□... consider attention to small matters as□not for their
master's honour and very easily□give themselves a dispensation from
having it.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It is useful to remember the context in which□Smith developed his
theories - that of a heavily planned and rather□dictatorial society,
where some individuals were above the law□and others were effectively
without any rights. In a centralised society□a few individuals make decisions on how to spend everyone's money□and direct everyone's
effort. As Smith said
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore,□in kings
and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of
private□people, and to restrain their expense...They are themselves
always, and□without exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the
society.
