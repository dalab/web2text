AFTER THE INTRODUCTION I WILL GIVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES, ONE TO THE COMMISSIONER OF LEER, AND ONE TO THE COMMISSIONER TONJ COUNTY. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE ORDER OF THEIR ADDRESSES.

THE OTHER JOURNALISTS WE HAVE WITH US HAVE JUST ARRIVED AND WILL BE LEAVING ON THE THIRD.

SO I'D LIKE EACH OF THE PARTNERS TO COME FORWARD, INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND GIVE A WORD OF GREETING FROM THEIR ORGANISATIONS.--- (JIENG WOMEN BEGIN SINGING, "GIVE US POWER TO TRIUMPH OVER EVIL; GIVE US POWER")--------------------------------  THANK YOU FOR THAT WONDERFUL GREETING FROM THE WOMEN.

I WAS ASKED TO CONVEY GREETINGS FROM THE CONFERENCE OF GERMAN-- CHURCHES. COMING FROM A COUNTRY THAT HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH SUFFERING TO MANY-- PEOPLE, WE ARE VERY AWARE THAT IF YOU CANNOT SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS AMIDST PEACE-- YOU CANNOT SOLVE THEM AMIDST WAR. WE SUPPORT YOUR NEGOTIATIONS TOWARD PEACE. I-- AFFIRM THE SAYING IN SWAHILI, WHICH SAYS, "WHEN THE CATTLE JOIN TOGETHER THE-- LION GOES TO SLEEP HUNGRY." AS WELL THERE IS A STAYING IN ETHIOPIA THAT SPEAKS-- OF CLIMBING A TREE TO SEE AFAR. WE WOULD LIKE TO CLIMB THE TREE WITH YOU TO-- LOOK INTO THE FUTURE IN THE SEARCH FOR GENUINE PEACE IN SUDAN. WE WILL DO ALL-- WE CAN TO SUPPORT THIS PEACE PROCESS. I CAN ONLY SAY PEACE BE WITH YOU AND-- PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL.--------  MY NAME IS JOHANN SVENSON AND I COME FROM THE LIFE AND PEACE INSTITUTE. OUR-- CONCERN IS TO STRENGTHEN THE INITIATIVES OF LOCAL PEOPLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO-- BRING PEACE.--------  MY NAME IS JUSTIN MAKUAC MANIEL, PEACE CO-ORDINATOR FROM THE DIOCESE OF-- RUMBEK, WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE NSCC. WE WERE PRIVILEGED TO BE AT-THE-- BEGINNING OF THIS PEACE PROCESS, MEETING-AT LOKI LAST JUNE. I'M PLEASED TO-- ANNOUNCE THAT OUR DIOCESAN SCHOOL IN KITALE (BLESSED BAGHITTA FORMATION CENTRE)-- HAS OFFERED TO RECEIVE NUER STUDENTS TO STUDY WITH THEM. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT-- ADVANCE.--------  MY NAME IS BENAIAH ODEMBA. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES.-- WE CONSIDER THE NSCC AS ONE-OF OUR STRONGEST PARTNERS IN SUDAN. WE ARE DEEPLY-- INVOLVED IN THIS PEACE INITIATIVE AND ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN BUILDING THE-LOCAL-- CAPACITY FOR BRINGING ABOUT PEACE.

WE LOOK-- FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE.--------  MY NAME IS LOUIE RIEMEN FROM CHURCH OF THE BRETHREN AND WE HAVE BEEN-- PARTNERS WITH NCC SINCE IT FIRST BEGAN.

AS WELL, THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRAYER WITH US EACH DAY OF OUR MEETINGS.----------  TD:---  OKAY, WE WILL NOT PROCEED WITH OUR PROGRAMME, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TWO REMARKS.--------------------  FIRST, RUMBEK DIOCESE, AND TORIT DIOCESE AND OTHERS THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT PARTNERS OF THIS CONFERENCE. THEY ARE ACTUALLY MEMBERS OF THE NSCC.------  SECONDLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNISE OTHER ORGANISATIONS, SUCH AS CEAS AND WORLD VISION WHO HAVE PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT IN PREPARATION FOR THIS CONFERENCE. AS WELL, THERE ARE A HOST OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS WHO STAND WITH US AND SUPPORT US.------  NOW I CALL UPON COMMISSIONER OF TONJ COUNTRY, ANDREW KUAC MAYOL, TO SPEAK TO US.--- (EXCHANGE OF SONG BEGINS, JIENG, NUER, RECIPROCALLY)--------------  ANDREW KUAC MAYOL:---  BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CONFERENCE I GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MOVEMENT, DR. JOHN GARANG DE MABIOR. I ALSO GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF TONJ COUNTY. IT WAS REALLY A CONCERN OF OUR PEOPLE YESTERDAY THAT OUR PEOPLE DID NOT SEE ME WELCOMING OUR GUESTS TO THIS MEETING HOUSE. PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT, AS A COMMISSIONER OF THIS PLACE, I WOULD SAY A WORD OF WELCOME TO THE DELEGATES IN GENERAL. LET ME PROCEED, BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR ME TO WELCOME YESTERDAY SO THAT THE COMMANDER AND THE GOVERNOR WERE ALSO TO HEAR WHAT THE COMMISSIONER OF TC WAS SAYING. BUT SINCE THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN, LET ME PROCEED WITH A BRIEF SPEECH, EVEN THOUGH THAT IS NOT EQUAL TO THE SPEECH I HAD PREPARED YESTERDAY.------  WHEN WE COME TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE GATHERED, WE WERE INFORMED LAST SEPTEMBER THAT THERE WOULD BE A NUER DINKA MEETING IN TONJ COUNTY. PREPARATIONS WERE MADE THEN, BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WE BEGAN TO DOUBT THAT THE MEETING MIGHT NOT BE A SUCCESS. WHY WERE WE DOUBTING? WE WERE DOUBTING BECAUSE, IN THE COURSE OF PREPARATIONS, THERE WERE THINGS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. BUT WE FOUND THAT LITTLE OR NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE AS FAR AS SOME SERVICES HAD PROCEEDED. COMMUNICATION WAS NOT PROMPT FROM NAIROBI TO OUR END. WE WERE RECEIVING COMMUNICATION AT SOME POINTS, BUT AT OTHERS WE WERE LOST IN THE LINE. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE HAD DIFFICULTY KNOWING WHO WAS TO DO WHAT, WHO WAS TO PREPARE WHAT. BUT IN TIME WE FOUND THAT MR. MARIO MUOR MUOR AND TULAR DENG HAD BEEN GIVEN CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES. I CAME TO THIS PLACE TO SPEAK WITH THE CHIEFS ASKING THAT THEY GET ON WITH THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUILDING GOT UNDERWAY, AS DID THE DIGGING OF A WELL. HOWEVER, IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE ONLY ONE WELL, WHICH RESULTS IN THE CONGESTION WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. SO LATER ON WHEN WE SAW MR. MARIO RUNNING BACK AND FORTH, WE WERE STRUCK BY WORDS LIKE THOSE OF SHAKESPEARE, WHICH SAID: ?? WE KNEW THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS. BUILDINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT QUICKLY. LIKE THESE BUILDINGS WERE BUILD QUICKLY IN A WAY THAT IS INADEQUATE-TO THE MODERN WAY OF PREPARATION. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE MANY OF-US SITTING ON THE GROUND. SO MUCH FOR THAT, LET US PROCEED.------  HERE, LET US COME TO THE VERY MATTER FOR WHICH WE HAVE GATHERED. IT IS GOOD TO SAY THAT WE ARE HERE TO RECORD A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN TONJ COUNTY IN PARTICULAR. THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY, HARDLY TO BE EQUALLED IN OUR HISTORY. THE NUER AND THE DINKA ARE ONE PEOPLE GIVEN THEIR SOCIAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. BUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME WE HAVE BEEN DIVIDED BY THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT OURSELVES. HOWEVER, IT IS OKAY BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE AWARE THAT SONS QUARREL WITH THEIR FATHER, AND DAUGHTERS WITH THEIR MOTHERS, BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN A FAMILY SITS TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES. YESTERDAY, WHO COULD NOT SEE THE WHITE BULL OUTSIDE HERE? THE BULL THAT WAS VERY FIERCE, THAT WAS ALMOST ON THE NECK OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED? THAT BULL WAS NOT BROUGHT BY ACCIDENT, BUT IT WAS BROUGHT BY DESIGN, AND THAT WAS A DESIGN FOR PEACE. SO, WITH THE WORDS OF THE SPEARMASTERS OVER THIS BULL YESTERDAY, I THOUGHT THAT THE ENTIRE EFFORT WAS FINISHED, AND THAT WE HAD COME HERE SIMPLY FOR FORMALITIES. IF WE DID UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF THE SPEARMASTERS TALKING OUTSIDE OVER THE BULL, AND EVEN INSIDE HERE, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO SAY. IT HAS BEEN DONE. WE HAVE ONLY TO REFLECT ON THE WISE RESOLUTIONS WHICH WE CAN MAKE TO BRING THE WORDS SPOKEN TO THEIR FULFILMENT.------  SOMETHING SMALL THAT I WOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE, I WILL HAVE TO SAY NOW. OUR MEETING FOR PEACE HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM FAR AWAY. DR. PETER NYOT IS HERE FROM GERMANY, AND MICHAEL WAL HAS COME FROM THE US, BOTH HAVE COME FROM AFAR TO JOIN WITH US. THIS SHOWS US THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER SINCE THOSE FROM FAR AWAY ARE JOINING WITH US HERE. AS WELL, OUR FOREIGN PRESS PEOPLE SHOW THAT THIS IS A WORLD-WIDE CONCERN, SINCE ORGANISATIONS FROM FAR AWAY HAVE SENT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. WE HAVE EVEN ASKED OURSELVES CONCERNING SOME PEOPLE, HOW THEY HAVE COME, IF THEY WERE INVITED BY THE CHURCHES OR OTHER PEOPLE. I'M SEEING BROTHER SAMUEL ARU WITH A VERY SERIOUS DELEGATION FROM KHARTOUM, SO I HAVE ASKED MYSELF IF OMER BASHIR IS INTERESTED IN PEACE. ANYWAY, TRANSLATION OF THIS KIND, MAKES A VERY SHORT SPEECH, TO BE FAR TOO LONG.------  THEREFORE I'LL CONCLUDE BY SPEAKING TO THE DINKA CHIEFS AND THE NUER CHIEFS. MINE IS A WORD OF CAUTION TO YOU. YOU SPOKE WELL YESTERDAY AS SPEARMASTERS, AS ELDERS, AND AS LEADERS. I WOULD WANT THAT TO BE REPEATED TODAY. BECAUSE WE HAVE COME HERE TO LOOK FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION AND UNITY. I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD NOT AIR OUT YOUR VIEWS, BUT THAT YOU SHOULD AIR OUT YOUR VIEWS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER. DON'T QUARREL HERE. DON'T QUARREL HERE. DON'T QUARREL HERE. YOU ARE TO SAY YOUR VIEWPOINTS HERE COOL HEADED, RATIONALLY, AND WITHOUT RAISING YOUR EMOTIONS. ALL OF US, THE INTELLECTUAL GUEST, ARE HERE TO HELP YOU COME TO HELPFUL RESOLUTIONS. YOU MUST SAY THE RIGHT THING. IT MAY HAPPEN THAT AT SOME POINT ONE OF YOU WILL CALL FOR US TO CLOSE THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE ARE ALL SAYING THE SAME THINGS. AVOID UNHELPFUL ARGUMENTS, MATTERS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY IN OUR DISCUSSION OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. LET US AVOID MATTERS THAT LOOK LIKE WE ARE IN THE COURTROOM. THIS IS NOT A COURT WE ARE CREATING HERE.------  SO, BEFORE I GO, I WOULD LIKE MY COUNTERPART, THE COMMISSIONER, TO COME HERE, SO THAT WE EXTEND TO EACH OTHER, THE GREETINGS OF PEACE.--- (THE NUER COMMISSIONER COMES FORWARD, AND THE TWO GRASP HANDS, HOLDING THEIR HANDS ALOFT BEFORE THE COMMUNITY; THE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES RESPOND WITH SONGS, CHANTS, AFFIRMING THE MEETING. NUER MOVE INTO A FULL CHANT WITH EXTENDED RESPONSES).------------ TD: I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO, SINCE THE COMMISSIONER HAS ALREADY INVITED THE COMMISSIONER FROM LEER.----------  COMMISSIONER OF LER, JOSEPH JUAC KON:----  I'M GREETING YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD, IN THE NAME OF OUR LAND, YOU, THE DINKA AND NUER, OUR GUESTS, AND YOU WHO HAVE ORGANISED THIS CONFERENCE. AS WELL, I'M SPEAKING OF THE PEACE THAT WAS SIGNED ON THE---ST APRIL,------ SO I'M GREETING IN THE NAME OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT. I AM THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF DR. RIAK MACHAR FOR THE CO-ORDINATING COUNCIL. I ALSO GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF THIS COUNCIL. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORMED, THE FORMER COMMANDERS-WHO WERE IN THE BUSH, THESE WERE CHOSEN TO BECOME THE GOVERNORS. . . . MAKER MACEK. WHEN I WAS APPOINTED AND CAME TO LEER AS ITS COMMISSIONER, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A GRASSROOTS PEACE INITIATIVE. SOME OF MY LEADERS WERE TAKEN TO LOKI FOR THE MEETINGS, AND SOON A NUMBER OF ABDUCTEES TAKEN FROM OUR PEOPLE WERE RETURNED TO US. I WAS THERE TO RECEIVE THEM AS THEY CAME HOME.------  I CAME HERE WITH FOURTEEN CHIEFS FROM MY AREA AND OTHERS FROM OTHER AREAS, SUCH REGIONS AS AKOBA AND NASIR ON THE EAST BANK. AND THOSE FAR NORTH OF BANTIU. WE ALL CAME TOGETHER WITH FIRM HOPE AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS PEACE. WE CAME HOPING THAT THE NUER AND DINKA WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE. WE, THE NUER FROM THE WESTERN UPPER NILE, ALL CAME, EXCEPT THOSE FROM MENKIN IN THE BUL AREA. YOU ALL KNOW THE CONFLICT THAT CONTINUES THERE, AND WE ASK YOU TO HOPE WITH US THAT THE FIGHTING IN THAT REGION WILL BE BROUGHT TO AN END. I CAME HERE WITH THE FIRST BRIGADE COMMANDER, AND ACTING ZONAL COMMANDER, PETER PAJIEK, WE CAME TOGETHER SO THAT HE CAN TALK TO HIS FORCES, TO PRESERVE THE RESOLUTIONS OF THIS IMPORTANT, HISTORICAL OCCASION. WE ALSO CAME WITH COMMANDER GABRIEL BOTH YOL WHO IS IN CHARGE OF SECURITY IN THE LEER STATE. AS WELL, BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF THIS PEACE BY DR. RIAK MACAR, THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE USDF HAS ALSO COME SO THAT HE CAN REPORT BACK THE RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE MADE HERE. GABRIEL YUOL DOK, AS SECRETARY OF THE PARTY IS WITH US. THE KHARTOUM AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED BY SAMUEL ARU. HE DID NOT COME HERE BECAUSE HE IS A SON OF THIS AREA BUT BECAUSE HE IS WITH RIAK IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND HE HAS COME TO WITNESS THIS IMPORTANT EVENT. THE SOUTHERN DEFENCE FORCES/MOVEMENT ARE REPRESENTED BY COMMANDER PETER RIIR PUK,--- (PRP COMES FORWARD AND SAYS THAT ALL THE SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE SPLA KNOW ME).---- THE SPEECH OF THE GOVERNOR OF BAHR EL GHAZEL, NHIAL DENG NHIAL, MADE ME VERY HAPPY, WHEN HE SAID THAT THE MATTER IS NOT SIMPLY FOR THE ORGANISATIONS TO COME TOGETHER, BUT THAT WE SHARE COMMON OBJECTIVES. HAVING HEARD THIS WE ALL SLEPT VERY SOUNDLY, WITH THE HOPE OF THESE WORDS. ALSO, AS WE ARE WITNESSING PEOPLE AS THEY SPEAK, WE ARE FURTHER CONVINCED BY THE ACTIONS OF COMMANDER SELVA. WE ARE GLAD TO SEE HIS FIRM, PRACTICAL COMMITMENT TO-FACILITATING THIS EFFORT TOWARD PEACE BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES.------  I WANT TO CORRECT THE STATEMENT MADE BY OUR ELDER WILLIAM, YESTERDAY, WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS A THIEF. HE DID NOT MEAN THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A THIEF. WE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF ONE FATHER. THOSE WHO ARE RAIDING CATTLE ARE WILLIAM'S CHILDREN, AND THUS HE IDENTIFIES WITH THEM. IT SEEMS THIS WAS MISUNDERSTOOD. HISTORICALLY, WE NUER, HAVE SO MANY DINKA WITH US, AND SO MANY OF OUR CHIEFS WERE ORIGINALLY DINKA. WHEN DINKA CAME TO SETTLE IN OUR LAND, WE USUALLY GAVE HIM THE FIRST PLACE, CHOOSING HIM AS LEADER. WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY WITH A MAN FROM AFAR BEING A LEADER AMONG OUR PEOPLE.------  I CONCLUDE MY SPEECH OFFERING THAT HISTORY. I GREET YOU ALL IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.----------  TD:---  (WHAT COMMANDER SELVA SAID AS HE OPENED HIS REMARKS YESTERDAY WAS SIMPLY A JOKE. THERE WAS NO REFERENCE TO THE ELDER, WILLIAM HIMSELF. IT WAS SIMPLY A HUMOROUS COMMENT). OUR NEXT SPEAKERS WILL BE WOMEN, ONE FROM BAHR EL GHAZEL, AND ONE FROM UPPER NILE. THE FIRST IS AWUT FROM BAHR EL GHAZEL, TO BE FOLLOWED BY DEBORAH NYANDIEN FROM UPPER NILE----------  AWUT DENG ACUIL:---  I AM CALLED AWUT, A WOMAN OF REK AND AGAR DINKA. I HAVEN'T NOTHING GREAT TO SAY TODAY. IN TERMS OF AGE I AM YOUNGER THAN MOST OF YOU. I AM ONLY A CHILD. THE JOY OF THE IN SUCH OCCASIONS, WHETHER YOU ARE YOUNG OR OLD, IT WILL NOT PROHIBIT FROM THE YOUNG FROM SPEAKING. I GREET YOU ALL, AND CONSIDER YOU ALL AS MY CHILDREN. WOMEN GIVES BIRTH TO A MAN, WHO BECOMES A WHITE HAIRED ELDER. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THIS GIVES US GREAT JOY THAT NUER AND DINKA SHOULD COME TOGETHER FOR ALL OF US HAVE SUFFERED, WITH MANY WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED DURING THE FIGHTING BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES. I EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO NSCC AND ALL AFFILIATED CHURCHES THAT HAVE BROUGHT US TOGETHER. I EXPRESS MY THANKS TO BOTH FOR SPLA AS WELL AS THE USDF, FOR IF THEY HAD NOT AGREED, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR US TO MEET IN THIS WAY. I THANK ALL THE CHIEFS AND ELDERS, NUER AND DINKA, WHO HAVE COME HERE KNOWING THAT FIGHTING WILL GET US NOWHERE, AND THAT WE MUST DISCUSS OUR DIFFERENCES IN THIS IMPORTANT GATHERING. I THANK THE FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE COME ALL THE WAY TO WUNLIT TO SIT DOWN WITH US AND OBSERVE OUR NEGOTIATIONS. I WILL NOT SPEAK LONG.------  THIS IS NOT A COURT, BUT A PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION. THE WOMEN OF BAHR EL GHAZEL, CONCERNING THEIR CHILDREN, THOSE THEY HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO, THAT THEY DON'T WANT THEIR OFFSPRING TO BE KILLED ANY MORE. YESTERDAY SOMEONE SAID THAT THE WOMEN HAD STOPPED BEARING CHILDREN. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY CEASED TO BEAR, BUT THEY WISH THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE ARMY, AS COMBATANTS COULD RETURN TO THEIR WOMBS AGAIN. IT IS BOTH THE WOMEN OF NUER AND DINKA WHO HAVE BORNE CHILDREN, BUT IT IS NOT OUR DESIRE THAT OUR YOUNG SHOULD DIE WITHOUT GOOD REASON.------  WHAT I BESEECH YOU, THE CHIEFS AND ELDERS OF NUER AND DINKA, THAT YOU WILL SETTLE THESE DIFFERENCES, THAT YOU COME TO FINAL RESOLUTIONS TO STOP THE KILLING OF OUR CHILDREN. I'LL DO AS THE COMMISSIONER OF TONJ HAS JUST DONE, I CALL ON DEBORA TO COME FORWARD-THAT WE AS WOMEN CAN GREET ONE ANOTHER (DEBORA COMES FORWARD; AWUT BEGINS TO SING, "DOORAY, DOORAY, WE HAVE COME FOR PEACE-----"). WE HOPE YOU HAVE HEARD OUR VOICES. I'VE COME TO EXPRESS MY JOY IN THIS PEACE EFFORT. I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY, AND GIVE PLACE TO DEBORAH.----------  DEBORAH NYANDIEN:---  I WILL SPEAK, AND I WILL USE MY NUER LANGUAGE. THE REASON I SPEAK IN NUER I'LL TELL YOU NOW. I AM CALLED DEBORAH YAAR JIENG. THOSE FROM YIROL AND RUMBEK WILL KNOW ME. MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE NUER WHO LEFT THEIR HOME FOR DINKALAND LONG AGO. WHEN THEY TRAVELLED, THEY WENT TO SETTLE NEAR YIROL WHERE MY UNCLE, NYIBOL, MY UNCLES ARE HERE NOW. WHEN I MARRIED, BY ACCIDENT, MATHIANG GOK KNEW THAT THEIR DAUGHTER WAS TAKEN BACK TO NUERLAND. I WILL STOP HERE CONCERNING MY OWN HISTORY, GOING TO THE CENTRE OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.------  I GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF ALL WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CREATED BY GOD TO BEAR CHILDREN. PEOPLE OF GOD, YOU THE NSCC, AND ALL RELATED CHURCHES, I GREET YOU WITH APPRECIATION FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO BRING OUR PEOPLES, NUER AND DINKA, WILL HAVE PEACE. I ALSO GREET ALL OUR GUESTS WHO ARE HERE. SPECIFICALLY, I GREET BILL LOWREY, WITH THANKS A HUNDRED TIMES OVER FOR HIS EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THIS LONG PROCESS UNTIL WE MEET AT THIS STAGE. THE TWO COMMUNITIES WHO FIRST WENT TO BILPHAM TO TRAIN TO FIGHT THIS WAR AGAINST THE ARABS. I GREET OUR ELDER SAMUEL ARU BOL WHO HAS COME TO WITNESS THIS MEETING. I AM A WOMEN'S LEADER AMONG WOMEN. I HAVE COME WITH 11 WOMEN FROM BENTIU TO ATTEND THIS MEETING. SIX WOMEN HAVE COME FROM KHARTOUM, ALL DINKA WOMEN HAVE COME TO OBSERVE.------  THE NUER WOMEN HAVE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE DINKA WOMEN, WHICH I NOW DECLARE. THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT GIVEN BY AWUT OUR SISTER. SINCE THE 1960S, BEGINNING OF THE WAR OF ANYANYA I, WE WANT TO KNOW FROM THE MEN, WHY OUR CHILDREN SHOULD BE DYING LIKE THIS ALL THESE YEARS! MY WORD-IS LIKE THAT OF AWUT. YOU THE NUER AND DINKA WOMEN, AND EVEN THOSE FROM OUTSIDE, I WANT-TO ASK THE MEN THIS QUESTION. WHAT I ASK IS HOW IT IS THAT, SINCE THE CREATION OF THE EARTH, WHETHER IN ALL OF HISTORY ANY MAN HAS DIED WITH A CHILD IN HIS WOMB? I'M NOT ASKING FOR AN ANSWER, BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT. BE QUIET, AND CONSIDER THIS QUESTION. I'LL-ADD THIS AS WELL: HAS ANY MAN EVER FELT THE GREAT PAINS OF LABOUR IN GIVING BIRTH? WOMEN, WE ALONE KNOW THE PAIN OF GIVING-BIRTH, AND OUR WORDS AND OUR-THOUGHTS MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. DON'T DISCARD THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR-WORDS! YOU DINKA AND-NUER DON'T OFTEN CONSIDER THE THOUGHTS OF WOMEN, BUT TODAY HEAR US CLEARLY, CONCERNING ALL THE CHILDREN HAVE DIED AMONG US. I'M SAYING-THIS BECAUSE , WHILE-YOUR ARE IN-DISCUSSION, , KNOW THAT WE WILL WATCH YOU CAREFULLY. IF YOU DON'T ULTIMATELY TAKE OUR WORDS SERIOUSLY, THEN YOU MUST UNDERSTAND WE WILL MAKE A REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL STOP GIVING BIRTH. I KNOW YOU MEN ARE LAUGHING BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU ARE MARRIED THROUGH PAYMENT OF BRIDE-PRICE OVER WHICH WOMEN HAVE NO CONTROL, AND ALSO THAT WOMEN HAVE NO POWER TO-MAKE A REVOLUTION AGAINST YOU. HOWEVER, WE ARE SPEAKING TODAY, NOT AS THE WOMEN OF THE PAST. I EXHORT YOU ALSO, NOT TO DISCUSS, WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK FROM YOUR DELIBERATIONS. TAKE AN OCCASIONAL BREAK. I THANK YOU AND CONCLUDE HERE.----------  TD:---  DR. HARUUN RUUN INVITES THE TWO COMMISSIONERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN AS WELL AS THE TWO WOMEN WHO HAVE JUST SPOKEN TO COME FORWARD.----------  HR:---  I-AM EMOTIONALLY MOVED-AND CANNOT EXPRESS MY FEELINGS STRONGLY ENOUGH. I WOULD-LIKE TO SUMMARISE-IT IN THIS WAY. I WANT-THE TWO COMMISSIONERS AND THE TWO LADIES, AND MYSELF TO JOIN OUR HANDS, AND DECLARE THAT WE WILL COMMIT OURSELVES TO DO ALL WE ARE ABLE TO BRING THIS PEACE TO FULFILMENT. WE WILL URGE OUR FRIENDS HERE IN SUDAN, IN AFRICA, AND-OUTSIDE AFRICA TO STAND BY US, AND-TO PRAY FOR US. LET ME REPEAT THE JOKE THAT WAS SAID EARLIER.-THE LADIES SAID, WE WILL GO ON STRIKE. IT IS POWERFUL, THAT WOMEN SHOULD REFUSE THEIR HUSBANDS. WE ARE NO LONGER TRADITIONAL LADIES, WE ARE WOMEN OF THE MODERN-WORLD AND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. LET US-JOIN HANDS. NOW, YOU LADIES, ALSO, KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR BOYS ARE DYING BECAUSE-YOU ARE SAYING, IF YOU-;HAVE NO MONEY AND YOU HAVE NO CATTLE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MARRY ME? YOU CANNOT WIN-A CHILD UNLESS YOU HAVE A COW WITH MILK. WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS AMONG US. AND WE MUST ALL TOGETHER ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK TOWARD A SOLUTION.--- (THE 2 WOMEN AND 3 MEN JOIN HANDS TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE OF THE HOUSE OF MEETING AND PHOTOGRAPHS ARE TAKEN. THEY LIFT THEIR HANDS UP TOGETHER. THE DINKA BEGIN TO SING, "WE-HAVE COME FOR PEACE . . .").---- THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU.----------  TD:---  LET ME READ FOR YOU THE PROGRAMME. FOLLOWING. IT IS NOW 12:----WE WILL RETURN AT 2:50 P.M. THE ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL BE AS FOLLOWS. WHAT WE WILL DO IS THIS. ANY ASPECT OF CLARIFICATION CAN BE MADE LATER. THE DINKA WILL BEGIN TO SPEAK OF THEIR EXPERIENCES DURING RECENT YEARS. THE LEADERS OF THE DINKA WILL SPEAK FIRST. THE COMMISSIONERS OF YIROL, TONJ, RUMBEK ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS AND CAN SHARE IN THE CONTENT OF THE CONFERENCE. I DECLARE THAT WE ARE FREE TO GO FOR LUNCH.----------------------------------------------------------------  AFTERNOON SESSION, 3:15 P.M.--------------------------------------------  TD:---  WE HAVE GUESTS WHO HAVE COME WHO NEED CHAIRS. I'M ASKING YOU DINKA TO ASSIST WITH THIS. LET US START OUR EVENING SESSION. BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE DINKA SIDE WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FEW INTRODUCTIONS. WHEN WE WERE IN NAIROBI WE FORMED A TEAM OF RAPPORTUERS, INDIVIDUALS WHO WE BELIEVE ARE DEVOTED TO THE PEACE PROCESS. THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE WITH US, THOUGH TWO WERE UNABLE TO JOIN US FROM EUROPE. BEFORE US ARE:---------------------------  MULANA---  DHOL ACUIL.--------------  MULANA---  JOHN LUK.--------  TIMOTHY TUT CHOL, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTACTS BETWEEN NSCC AND THE SPLA--------  ON THE SIDE OF USDF WE HAVE BILL MAR.--------  WE HAVE FARUK GATKUOTH, ALSO OF USDF.--------  THE TWO WHO COULD NOT ATTEND FROM EUROPE ARE RUTH DANIER, AND MAJOK GUANDO.-- I NOW INVITE REV. BILL LOWREY TO TELL US SOMETHING OF THE PREPARATIONS.------------------------  BL:---  EVER SINCE THE LOKI ACCORD WAS SIGNED ON 10TH JUNE, 1998 WE HAVE HAD A TEAM WORKING ON THIS CONFERENCE TO TAKE PLACE IN BEG. WHEN WE MET IN LOKI THE CHIEFS AND CHURCHLEADERS FROM THE WEST SIDE OF THE NILE PUT TOGETHER THEIR PLANS FOR THIS CONFERENCE. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID WAS THAT THIS WOULD BE A CONFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE, IN WHICH LOCAL PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THE LEAD, AND IT WOULD NOT INCLUDE POLILTICAL LEADERS. THEY MAY-BE PRESENT AS OBSERVERS BUT NOT AS PARTICIPANTS. THEY SAID THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE MOBILISED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CONFERENCE, THAT NSCC SHOULD PREPARE THE CONFERENCE, AND THAT OBSERVERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD MUST BE INVITED TO ATTEND. SO FOR THESE MANY MONTHS THERE HAVE-BEEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE INVOLVED. GRADUALLY THE GROUP HAS CHANGED, WITH WOMEN AND-CHIEFS ALWAYS PART OF THE PROCESS, AND ALWAYS THERE HAS BEEN THE DESIRE TO HAVE DINKA AND NUER FROM OUTSIDE AS FULL PARTNERS IN THE PROCESS. SO I NOW WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE NOW. SOME ARE NOT PRESENT, BUT HAVE WORKED HARD OVER THE MONTHS, BUT I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO THOSE WHO ARE NOW WITH US. THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR TEAM IS DR. HARUUN RUUN.------  WE HAVE TWO-PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED TO MOBILISE THE PEOPLE IN-BEG AND-IN WESTERN UPPER NILE.-ONE IS REV. MATTHEW MATHIANG DENG. THE SECOND IS JUDGE TELAR DENG. WE HAVE HAD-TWO WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH US, AWUT DENG WHOM YOU-HEARD SPEAK THIS MORNING. THE SECOND IS NYAWARAGA JOSHUA WHO IS NOT ABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY. WE HAVE ASKED INTELLECTUALS FROM THE DIASPORA TO COME AND BE PART OF THIS TEAM. ONE OF THOSE IS DR. PETER NYOT KOK FROM GERMANY, AND THE OTHER IS DR. MICHAEL LUAL DUANY FROM THE USA. ALWAYS, AS IT WAS POSSIBLE, WE HAVE ASKED THAT-CHIEFS MEET WITH US SO THAT THEY COULD-OBSERVE IF WE WERE KEEPING ON THE PATH THAT-WAS-SET FOR US AT LOKI. AND I, DR. BILL LOWREY, HAVE SERVED AS A FACILITATOR FOR THIS TEAM. THE TWO CHIEFS WHO HAVE BEEN MOST INVOLVED WITH US THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS ARE, FIRST, CHIEF DUT MALUAL, WHO I UNDERSTAND IS SICK IN NAIROBI, AND WE ARE MISSING HIM. THE SECOND OF THEM IS CHIEF ISAAC MAGOK FROM LEER (STANDS, WAVING HIS FLY WHISK).------  NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU-A SHORT STORY FROM THE BIBLE, THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR THE DINKA TO TELL THEIR STORY BEFORE THE NUER, AND FOR THE NUER TO TELL THEIR STORY BEFORE THE DINKA. THIS IS A STORY THAT I TOLD-IN LOKI FOR THE CHIEFS AND LEADERS IN LOKI, AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THREE DAYS IN WHICH THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES, EACH GROUP TO THE OTHER. AS YOU KNOW, TODAY IS SUNDAY, WHICH IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK. IT WAS ON A SUNDAY, AFTER JESUS HAD DIED ON THE CROSS AND BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD, THAT THIS STORY TOOK PLACE. MOST OF THE DISCIPLES WERE TOGETHER IN A SPECIAL ROOM, BUT ONE WAS MISSING. HIS NAME WAS THOMAS. AND SUDDENLY JESUS-APPEARED IN THE ROOM, AND HIS MESSAGE WAS, "PEACE BE WITH YOU.--THE DISCIPLES WERE EXCITED TO SEE HIM, BUT WHEN THEY TOLD THOMAS, HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE-IT. HE SAID, UNLESS I-SEE HIM, AND PUT MY FINGERS IN HIS SIDE WHERE THE SPEAR WENT IN, I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT. ONE WEEK-LATER, AGAIN ON A SUNDAY, JESUS APPEARED IN THE ROOM AND THOMAS WAS PRESENT. JESUS SAID TO THOMAS, "REACH OUT YOUR FINGERS AND-FEEL THE WOUND WHERE-THE SPEAR WENT IN.------"  THIS IS A CONFERENCE ABOUT RECONCILIATION. THOMAS COULD NOT BE RECONCILED UNTIL HE COULD SEE THE WOUNDS THAT HE HAD HELPED TO CAUSE, AND TOUCH THE PLACES WHERE JESUS HAD BEEN WOUNDED. FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS NOW, NUER HAVE CAUSED WOUNDS AND INJURIES TO THE DINKA, AND FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS NOW, DINKA HAVE CAUSED WOUNDS AND INJURIES TO THE NUER. IF YOU WANT TO BE RECONCILED YOU MUST TELL EACH OTHER THE WOUNDS YOU HAVE SUFFERED, YOU MUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND REACH OUT AND TOUCH ONE ANOTHER IN THE PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN-WOUNDED. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, THAT YOU NOT HIDE ANYTHING FROM ANOTHER,-SO THAT THE RECONCILIATION GOES DEEP, AND-IT IS A GENUINE HEALING OF THE WOUNDS YOU HAVE INFLICTED. WHEN YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, WHEN YOU SAY THE HARD THINGS TO EACH OTHER,-WHEN YOU IDENTIFY THE ISSUES THAT MUST BE SOLVED, THEN YOU CAN RECONCILE RELATIONSHIPS, AND YOU CAN WALK-OUT OF HERE, SAYING NOW WE ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ONCE AGAIN. IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, YOU AS THE DINKA, WILL BEGIN TO TELL THE NUER YOUR STORIES. DO NOT HOLD BACK. TELL THE TRUE STORIES, NO MATTER HOW PAINFUL IT MAY BE. IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, WHEN THE DINKA TELL THEIR STORIES, YOU NUER, YOU MUST LISTEN CAREFULLY. DO NOT DEBATE WITH THEM, DO NOT ARGUE-WITH THEM. RELATIONSHIPS BEGIN WITH LISTENING. AND WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED YOU WILL TELL YOUR STORIES TO THEM. THE TIME OF BEAUTIFUL SPEECHES IS OVER. IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE HARD WORK OF PEACE. YOU MUST MAKE A PEACE THAT WILL LAST. WHEN I SIT DOWN,-THIS WILL BE YOUR WORK. YOU, NUER AND DINKA, MUST MAKE THIS PEACE AND DETERMINE HOW DEEP THE PEACE WILL GO. MAY GOD GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH YOU NEED.----------  TD:---  OKAY, I INTRODUCE TO YOU DR. PETER NYOT KOK, WHO WILL TAKE THE CHAIR AS THE DINKA PRESENT THEIR NARRATIVES. THE FIRST SPEAKER WILL BE CHIEF DUT YOL.----------  DR. PETER NYOT KOK:---  I GREET YOU WARMLY,-YOU NUER AND DINKA, YOU CHIEFS AND ELDERS, WOMEN AND YOUTH, YOU SOLDIERS, MAY YOU ALL BE BLESSED HERE. THE TALK TODAY AND ONWARDS IS FOR YOU THE CHIEFS TO TALK, NOT ME. HOWEVER, AFTER YOU HAVE CONCLUDED YOUR STATEMENTS, I WILL SPEAK. PEACE AND RECONCILIATION BEGAN YESTERDAY WHEN A WHITE BULL WAS SACRIFICED, AND LIBATIONS WERE POURED. WE HAD ALREADY RAISED THE HOUSE OF PEACE, BUT WHAT REMAINS IS THE PLASTERING OF THE WALLS AND FLOOR AND ROOFING OF THE BUILDING OF PEACE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT EASY WORK THAT IS BEFORE US. IF WE PLASTER THE HOUSE WRONGLY IT IS LIKELY THAT INSECTS WILL STILL BIGHT US. IF WE DON'T PUT UP GOOD POLES IT IS LIKELY THAT THE HOUSE WILL LEAK. I WILL START WITH WHAT BILL LOWREY HAS SAID, THAT WE MUST DRAW FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR ANCESTORS. WE DO EACH STAGE OF THE WORK SO THAT IT-IS SUCCESSFUL, AND IT IS A SOLID HOUSE. DURING OUR MEETING WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE CHIEFS WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING-IN LOKI, AND WE WILL-MOVE AHEAD SO THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH COUNTY HAS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.-I AM APPEALING TO THE TRANSLATORS WHO-ARE SPEAKING IN DINKA,-NUER OR ENGLISH THAT-YOU WORK TO TRANSLATE ACCURATELY,-BECAUSE THIS IS A DIFFICULT ASPECT OF OUR WORK. NOW I WILL CALL CHIEF KULONG MARIAL AND, SECONDLY, CHIEF JUOL MACOK. TOGETHER THEY WILL HAVE ONE HOUR TO SPEAK.----------  CHIEF KULONG MARIAL:---  I WILL NOT SPEAK AT LENGTH. I HAVE BEEN A CHIEF FOR-A LONG TIME, IN THE AREA OF MAPEER IN RUMBEK. BY ETHNIC GROUP I AM AGAR FROM BEG REGION. SOME MONTHS AGO I ATTENDED THE MEETING IN LOKI FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN DINKA AND NUER. WHEN I RETURNED FROM LOKI I DISSEMINATED THE CONTENT OF THE ACCORD AMONG DINKA-AND NUER. RECENTLY, I ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE EXCHANGE VISITS OF THE CHIEFS, STOPPING AT LEER, AND HERE. YESTERDAY WE-BEGAN OUR RECONCILIATION BY OFFERING A WHITE BULL, AND WE SAID ALL THAT NEEDED TO BE SAID, AND THE BULL IS NOW IN ITS ETERNAL EXISTENCE ABOVE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR TRADITIONAL PRACTICE THAT, WHEN WE HAVE CONFLICTS, AS WE OFTEN DO, WE MAKE SACRIFICE AND WE ARE ABLE TO RECONCILE AND RETURN TO OUR NORMAL LIFE. USUALLY WE CONCLUDE BY CONFIRMING AN ACCORD BETWEEN OURSELVES-AND NUER WITH AN ACCORD THAT STATES WE WILL NO LONGER RAID ONE ANOTHER SO THERE IS NO MORE LOSS OF PROPERTY OR LIFE. AT THE END OF EVERY CONFERENCE WE COME OUT WITH DECLARATIONS WHICH ARE SENT TO LEER, MAPEER, TONJ, AND ELSEWHERE, CONFIRMING THAT WE SHOULD NO LONGER FIGHT EACH OTHER. AND THE PRESENT RECONCILIATION, BEING ASSISTED BY THE CHURCHES, MEANS THAT WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT DIVIDE US-AND BRING CONFLICT AND WE PUT AN END TO THEM. SOMETIMES BACK WE HAD A CONFERENCE IN GAINLEL, AND WE SACRIFICED BULLS AND THAT CONCLUDED OUR CONFLICTS BETWEEN DINKA AND NUER. AS WELL, WE HAD A CONFERENCE AT WUNILOOR, AND THAT MEETING ENDED OUR PROBLEMS UNTIL THE CONFLICTS OF ANYANYA I BROUGHT OUT NEW CONFLICTS BETWEEN DINKA AND NUER. THE BORDER CONFLICTS INTENSIFIED AGAIN WITH THE TENSION BETWEEN SPLA AND NUER, GIVING THIEVES CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN WELL-BEING OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOIT OUR DIFFERENCES. AS WELL, OUR DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED BY OUR ENEMIES. D----&N ARE BROTHERS, WHO SHARE COMMON BORDERS. WITH OUR SACRIFICE YESTERDAY OUR HOSTILITY WAS BROUGHT TO AN END. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST THIS PEACE AGREEMENT, WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM OUR HOSTILITY. THERE WILL BE SOME WHO WILL COME TRYING TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLES ON EACH SIDE TO BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER WILL NOT BE FAITHFUL TO OUR AGREEMENT, BUT WE MUST NOT LISTEN TO THESE DECEPTIVE WORDS. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FIGHTING EACH OTHER, D----&N, BUT HAS NEVER BEFORE HAPPENED THAT WE DESERTED LANDS SUCH AS MAPEER. TODAY IT IS OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME IN TO EXACERBATE THESE CONFLICTS. AN-EXAMPLE IS THAT OUR ANCESTRAL HOME OF RUMBEK WAS IN THE HAND IN THE ENEMY. NOW THAT WE HAVE CAPTURED IT FROM THE ENEMY WE HAVE MADE ALTERATIONS AND-WE ARE ABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OWN LANDS COMFORTABLY. AS I SAID, IN-RESPECT TO RUMBEK, I-CAN NOW RETURN TO MY ANCESTRAL HOME OF MAPEER AND WE CAN SETTLE THERE ONCE AGAIN. NORMALLY, IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US AND NUER, WHAT KEEPS CONFLICTS FROM BEING CONCLUDED, IS WHEN VARIOUS PRETEXTS ARE BROUGHT UP, SAYING WE MUST LOCATE THE THIEF, AND FIND THE DETAILS OF THE CASE. ALL OF THESE ARE DELAYING TACTICS, WHICH SHOULD NOT-DETER US FROM PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. YESTERDAY WE SEALED OUR COVENANT. IT IS NOT IN DINKA TRADITION THAT WE SHOULD BEGIN ACCUSING ONE ANOTHER, OR QUARRELLING WITH ONE ANOTHER, AFTER SACRIFICE IS OFFERED. WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS HERE. OUR GATHERING HERE IS HEARD ALL OVER THE WORLD, IN KHARTOUM AND JUBA, AND MANY OTHER PLACES. THUS, IN MY VIEW, THERE IS NO USE IN TALKING ABOUT PAST GRIEVANCES. WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS CONCRETE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN TO BRING PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES. FROM-THIS DAY FORWARD WE MUST STOP THE KILLING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND DESTRUCTION OF OUR PROPERTIES. WE RECONCILE OURSELVES FROM YIROL, RUMBEK AND BENTIU. I WILL NOT PROCEED FURTHER WITH MY ADDRESS. THIS IS THE MESSAGE I'M TELLING THE PEOPLE OF GOGRIAL AND TUIC, THAT OUR RECONCILIATION WAS CONCLUDED YESTERDAY WITH THE OFFERING OF OUR-WHITE BULL. THIS IS MY WORD.----------  PNK:---  WE HAVE HEARD CHIEF KULONG MARIAL. OUR SECOND SPEAKER IS CHIEF JOL MACOK.----------  CHIEF JUL MACOK LIENY:---  I AM AGAR FROM RUMBEK. I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO HAVE ORGANISED THIS CONFERENCE. I'M GRATEFUL TO BILL LOWREY AND GREET HIM. I WARMLY GREET MY BROTHERS FROM BENTIU, AS WELL AS THOSE FROM BEG. ALSO, I GREET THOSE FROM NAIROBI. WE ARE HERE FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION, WHICH WE HAVE ACCEPTED. THIS CONFERENCE WE DECLARE THAT WE HAVE FULLY ACCEPTED THIS RECONCILIATION. IF WE WERE IN A COURT I WOULD HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE OF BENTIU. WHEN PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN GOING TO BONGO, THE TRAINING CAMP, IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM OF THE SOUTH THAT TOOK THEM. WHEN THOSE WHO WENT TO BONGO SPLIT APART, IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT WE ACCEPTED THAT SEPARATION. I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT IN LEER, UNTIL I SAW THE COMMISSIONER OF LEER. I HAVE NO BAD COMMISSIONER FROM LEER. WHEN WE SAID EARLIER THAT WE SHOULD SAVE LIVES, I ALSO ACCEPT FULLY WHAT YOU SAID, BECAUSE I HAVE A BORDER WITH CHIEF MALUAL WUN. IN MY COMMUNITY I HAVE A FEW PEOPLE FROM BENTIU, LIKE THOSE STAYING HERE AT WUNLIT. OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE OF ADOOR, THAT IS THOSE OF YIROL AND RUMBEK, IS THAT WE ARE CHILDREN OF ONE FAMILY. WE HAD NO PART IN THE DIVISION THAT HAD HAPPENED. WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO ASK QUESTION OF THE PEOPLE OF BENTIU, I ACTUALLY WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THOSE OF ADOOR. AS A GOOD GESTURE, AND TO DECLARE THAT WE ACCEPT PEACE, I WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE WHO RAIDED CATTLE ON THE 18TH HAVE NOW BEEN APPREHENDED, AND THE CATTLE ARE TO BE RETURNED. THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION IN RUMBEK ORDERED ALL CHIEFS TO APPREHEND THE RAIDERS AND RETURN THE CATTLE. THIS HAS NOW BEEN DONE.--- (TD: I BELIEVE CHIEF CHUL WAS SPEAKING OF TWO RAIDS. ONE WAS ON THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY, AND THE OTHER ON THE 8TH. I BELIEVE THAT THE THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRST HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED.)---- BEFORE ALL WHO ARE IN ATTENDANCE HERE I WANT TO AFFIRM THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PEACE BETWEEN US. AT PRESENT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE FROM YIROL TO ADOOR AND THEY HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY THE RESIDENTS. I WILL CONCLUDE HERE BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE RECONCILED WITH THE PEOPLE OF MALUAL WUN AS OF TODAY.----------  PNK:---  WE HAVE ONE HALF OF AN HOUR REMAINING FROM THE TIME GIVEN TO RUMBEK, AND WE INVITE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS FROM RUMBEK, IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO CONTRIBUTE. FROM RUMBEK WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY FOUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE MARIAL MALWAL AROP AND COL MADUL RILPIOU. I NOW GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO CHIEF MARIAL MALUAL AROP, TO SPEAK TOWARD A PEACE THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN, CANNOT BE DEMEANED BY CROOKS.----------  CHIEF MARIAL MALUAL AROP:---  WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS BRIEF. OUR FATHER, MALUAL WUN, I GREET THEM WITH THOSE WHO CAME WITH HIM. I ALSO GREET ALL THE CHIEFS FROM BEG. I WANT TO GREET OUR FATHER MALUAL WUN IS BECAUSE HE WAS ACTIVE WORKING TOGETHER WITH MY FATHER. WHEN CHIEF KULONG RETURNED FROM LOKI I ASKED IF CHIEF MALUAL WAS STILL ALIVE. MALUAL IS NOW THE ONLY ONE REMAINING CHIEF WITH SONS OF THE CHIEFS WHO ONCE WERE HIS COUNTERPARTS. WE ARE ALL CHILDREN, OF THIS ONE FATHER WHO REMAINS, MALUAL WUN. IF THERE IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM, AND YOUR FATHER IS STILL ALIVE, HE WOULD BE THE ONE WHO RESTRAINS THE CHILDREN FROM SELF DESTRUCTION. THE WISDOM OF CMW AND OUR WISDOM IS NOT THE SAME. HE BEGAN WORKING SINCE THE TIME OF THE BRITISH WITH OUR FATHERS. MOST OF US BEGAN WORKING DURING THE TIME OF INDEPENDENCE WITH THE ARABS. WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT CMW OF THE SAYING IN DINKA. A LION SAID TO A FATHER TO GIVE HIM HIS CHILDREN SO HE COULD EAT THEM. TODAY ALL OUR FATHERS ARE GONE EXCEPT CMW. THE LION ATE ALL THE ELDERLY PEOPLE, BUT ONE OLD PERSON WAS HIDDEN BY HIS CHILDREN. THE LION THAT ATE THE ELDERLY PEOPLE HAPPENED TO SWALLOW A SNAKE WITH WATER. THE SNAKE WOULD COME FROM HIS STOMACH, PEAKING OUT FROM HIS MOUTH. ON PERSON SUGGESTED THAT HE BRING AND OLD MAN TO TAKE THE SNAKE FROM THE STOMACH OF THE LION, WOULDN'T THE LION EAT THE OLD MAN? THE LION ACCEPTED THE OLD MAN TO BE BROUGHT. HE CAME AND ASKED THE LION TO LAY DOWN, AND TIED A RAT TO THE LEG OF THE LION. THEN THE SNAKE CRAWLED OUT TO EAT THE SNAKE.------  TO YOU, OUR FATHER MALUAL, YOU ARE THE ONLY FATHER OF ALL OUR PEOPLES AMONG D----&N. NOW WE WANT TO DRAW OUT THE SNAKE NOW. IF YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THAT THE SNAKE IN YOUR STOMACH SHOULD BE BROUGHT OUT BY THE RAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED TO BRING OUT THE SNAKE, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE KILLED THE WHITE BULL YESTERDAY. LET YOUR LION NOT COME AGAIN TO ATTACK THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN. HOW COULD WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT PEACE? THE--- TOC---- WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SHARING. IS YOUR AREA GANLIL NOW EMPTY OF PEOPLE? WE HAVE ACCEPTED RECONCILIATION. WHEN WE BYPASS WHAT OUR BROTHER SAID BEFORE, AND WE SIT TO DISCUSS THE PAST GRIEVANCES, WE ARE QUENCHING THE FIRE WITH WATER AND NOT QUENCHING THE FIRE WITH MORE FIRE. IF THERE IS ANY DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SIDES THEN WE WILL NOT REACH OUR CONCLUSION. LET US CLOSE THE OLD CHAPTER SINCE ANYANYA I AND BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER. THIS IS NOT A COURT. IF IT WERE A COURT WE WOULD ENUMERATE OUR GRIEVANCES. IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO RECONCILIATION, LET US NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PAST. LET US SIMPLY ENTER THE RECONCILIATION AND ACT AS BROTHERS. LET PEACE MULTIPLY AS EACH PERSON ACCEPTS PEACE AND RETURNS HOME TO PLANT THIS SEED AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE. WE PEOPLE OF RUMBEK, WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN OUR MIND SINCE THE CONFLICT BEGAN. WE ARE CONTINUING WITH IT. TO CONCLUDE MY TALK, IT IS THAT WE USED QUARRELLED IN THE PAST, BUT TODAY OUR CONFLICT IS DIFFERENT. I BELIEVE WE ARE ONE, WE CAN FOLLOW EACH OTHER'S FOOTSTEPS. WE HAVE NOW ACCEPTED RECONCILIATION AND-PEACE. IF PEOPLE SIT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS, THIS IS A HOUSE OF GOD. AND IF SOMEBODY COMES AGAINST THIS YOU, OUR BROTHER. WHATEVER THE QUARREL IN THE PAST, LET IT CONCLUDE. MY WORD STOPS HERE.----------  PNK:---  I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORD, YOU PEOPLE OF RUMBEK. THOSE OF RUMBEK ARE LEFT WITH 5 MINUTES. CHIEF COL MADOL ARILPIOU WILL SPEAK IN THIS TIME.----------  CHIEF COL MADOL ARILPIOU:---  THE FIRST PERSON I WILL GREET IS GOD. AS WE ARE HERE IN THIS HOUSE OF GOD, WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY THE CHRISTIANS. GOD HATES JEALOUSY AND HATRED. GOD HAS TIED THE LEG OF HATRED DOWN NOW. THIS JEALOUSY IS CALLED YOU, OUR BROTHERS, NUER, AND JIENG, WE HAVE BEEN MADE TO COLLIDE. THE TWO PIECES OF WOOD THAT HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER TO CAUSE THE FIRE. GOD HAS DIVIDED THINGS LONG AGO. HE GAVE NUER THE YOUNG COW. HE GAVE DINKA THE OLD COW. THIS BROUGHT CONFLICT, THAT WE MUST NOW BRING TO AN END. WE DINKA WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RECONCILIATION WITH ALL OUR HEARTS, BUT WE HAVE SOME DOUBT ABOUT OUR BROTHERS NUER. YOU, NUER, WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING GOOD, YOU CHANGE IT INTO SOMETHING BAD THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE REASON I SAY THIS, IS THAT WE WENT TO BONGO BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. THE ARAB CLAIMS THIS LAND. WHEN WE WENT TO BONGO IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM WITH THE ARABS, BUT THEN WE BEGAN TO QUARREL AMONG OURSELVES. WE HAVE KILLED OURSELVES IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN OUR ORIGINAL ENEMY EVER KILLED US. THE CONFLICT BETWEEN D----&N, HAS LED TO THE POINT THAT THE WOMEN ARE NOW THE ONES WHO DIE IN LARGE NUMBERS. IN THE OLD DAYS THE MEN DIED AND WERE EATEN BY BIRDS, BUT TODAY THE WOMEN DIE. THIS HAS COME FROM YOU NUER. YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF WOMEN. YOU MALUAL, YOU STOP THAT ATTITUDE, AND STOP KILLING WOMEN AND CHILDREN FOR NO REASON.----------  PNK:---  THE ADDRESSES OF RUMBEK COUNTY ARE FINISHED, AND I THANK YOU THREE CHIEFS. WE HAVE HEARD YOUR WORDS IN FULL. AS WELL I THANK OUR BROTHERS NUER FOR LISTENING CAREFULLY TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID. THIS IS NOT THE END OF THOSE WHO WILL SPEAK. WE WILL CONTINUE IN THE DAYS AHEAD. NOW WE TURN TO THE LIST OF CHIEFS OF TONJ COUNTY WHICH I HAVE JUST RECEIVED. THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE: CHIEF DUT YOL, CHIEF GUM MADING AKUCBENY, AND OUR MOTHER SADIA MANOK. JUST NOW I INVITE DUT YOL TO COME SPEAK. YOU, PEOPLE OF TONJ COUNTY, YOU HAVE BUT ONE HOUR TO SPEAK.----------  CHIEF DUT YOL:---  MY NAME IS DUT YOL MANYOK, A MAN OF TONJ COUNTY, AND THE SECTION OF . I WILL NOT SPEAK AT LENGTH. WHAT I WILL SAY FIRST IS THAT I AM PLEASED THAT ALL OUR PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED HERE. FIRST I WILL SPEAK ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE BAD BETWEEN US. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS KILLED ME. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE SIMPLY BEEN STAYING WITH THE NUER. WHEN WE WENT TO THE BUSH THEY TOOK OUR CHILDREN. WHAT MADE THEM TO QUARREL IN BONGO WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. THOSE WHO STAYED WITH US AS OUR BROTHERS, THEY BEGAN TO KILL US. SOME WERE STAYING WITH US AND OUR PEOPLE TRIED TO KILL THEM, BUT WE REFUSED. THOSE WHO WANTED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES, WE ACCOMPANIED THEM. SOME ARE STILL STAYING WITH US TODAY. WE HAVE THE CHIEF CALLED MADING MANYEL WHO WAS KILLED TOGETHER WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY AND 18 CATTLE CAMPS. ALSO 150 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, AND 5 OF OUR YOUNG WOMEN WERE TAKEN WHO ARE WITH THEM UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY. WHEN THEY CAME THEY ALSO ATTACKED THE SECTION OF DET MADHEU. THEY TOOK ALMOST 20,000 HEAD OF CATTLE. 90 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AT ONCE. ALSO, DURING THE RAINY SEASON, THEY CAME AND ATTACKED THE PLACE OF MAKUAC. WHEN THEY CAME BACK TO ATTACK FOR THE SECOND TIME THEY TOOK EVERYTHING, LEAVING NOT EVEN A DOG OR A CHICKEN. THEY RAIDED THE ENTIRE CATTLE CAMP. ALL THE HOMESTEADS WERE BURNED, ALL OF MAKUAC WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. AFTER 11 DAYS ABOC WAS RAIDED, CATTLE CAMP OF , WUNICUEI,------  MABIOR, ABOC, MAKUAC, WAIYAAR CC, WUNICUEI, BIKLIIR. THEY TOOK ALL THE CHICKENS, THE WOMEN CHILDREN. ONLY A FEW OF US REMAINED WHO RAN AWAY. NOW-THAT YOU HAVE COME I-AM NOT ANGRY, BUT HAPPY. IF EVEN ONE PERSON-REMAINS, AND WE HAVE PEACE, THAT PERSON CAN MULTIPLY. WHAT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IS OUR BROTHER NUER WERE-THE ONES TO START TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING ME. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER. WE HAVE BEEN RECONCILED BY A MAN CALLED TELAR RING IN A PLACE CALLED MAAL. WHY THEY KILL US, WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED IF THEY HAD SPOKEN FIRST SO THAT THEY CAN EXPLAIN PRECISELY-WHY THEY HAVE KILLED US AS REVENGE. SINCE THEY ARE WITH US NOW, AND THEY ALL KNOW ME. SOME OF THEM HAVE THEIR CHILDREN STAYING WITH US HERE. THOSE CHILDREN WHO I HAVE ACCOMPANIED BACK HOME, THEY ARE HOME NOW. I NOW WANT OUR BROTHERS TO SPEAK OUT THE GRIEVANCES THEY HAVE AGAINST ME SO I CAN UNDERSTAND. BUT THE SOURCE OF OUR QUARREL IS THIS, THE NUER AND WE ARE ONE. I DON'T LOOK AT THEM AS ENEMIES. WE SHARE ONE--- TOC---- AND ONE BORDER BETWEEN US. WE REGARD THEM AS OUR ELDERS TO OURSELVES BECAUSE THEIR FATHER IS ELDER. WHEN THEIR FATHER WAS BORN HE COULD NOT HER BUT WAS DEAF. WHEN MY FATHER WAS BORN HE WAS BLIND. HE CAME IN A SECRET WAY, MY DEAF UNCLE TO RAID MY CATTLE BECAUSE MY FATHER COULD NOT SEE. MY FATHER WENT TO GOD AND SAID THAT THIS BROTHER COMES AND STEALS MY CATTLE. AND GOD SAID, OKAY, IT IS SOMETHING GOOD. GOD GAVE A GIRL TO OUR DINKA FATHER WHO WAS BLIND. ONCE HE MARRIED, HE NEVER PRODUCED ANOTHER BLIND MAN AMONG HIS CHILDREN. AND THE DEAF FATHER OF NUER NEVER PRODUCED A DEAF MAN. ALL THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HEALTHY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. AFTER WE HAVE PRODUCED GOOD CHILDREN WE STILL CARRY ON THIS OLD TRADITION BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT LIBERATED THEMSELVES FROM THE WAY OF THEIR FATHER.------  TODAY GOD WENT TO BRING A FOREIGNERS AND TOLD THEM, IF THESE TWO PEOPLES QUARREL, STAND BETWEEN THEM, AND SEE WHY THEY ARE QUARRELLING. TODAY, ESPECIALLY IT IS THE CHURCH LEADERS WHO HAVE COME HERE. IT IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THEM TO ASK US WHAT OUR PROBLEM IS SO THAT IT CAN BE RESOLVED BETWEEN US. WHAT I KNOW IN MY HEART THIS YEAR, AFTER THEY HAVE KILLED OUR CHILDREN, AND KILLED OUR CHILDREN, AND TAKEN ALL OUR CATTLE, AND ALL THE GOATS, AFTER ALL OF THIS, WHAT REMAINS IS ONLY THEIR BROTHER WHO IS BLIND IS THEIR BROTHER. THEY CAN TAKE THEIR BLIND BROTHER AND KILL HIM. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST RECONCILIATION TALKS. WE BEGAN THEM IN GAINLEL, AND AGAIN WE CAME TO MAL. TODAY, IN WUNLIT, THIS IS THE THIRD PEACE RECONCILIATION. THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE ORGANISED THIS CONFERENCE, I ASK YOU TO INVITE OUR BROTHER NUER TO SPEAK OUT PRECISELY WHAT IS IN THEM, WHY THEY HAVE DESTROYED US. YOU WHO ORGANISED THIS CONFERENCE, I WILL NOT BOTHER TO TALK ABOUT THE LOSS OF THE CATTLE, OR OTHER PROPERTY, OR DEAD PEOPLE. WHAT WE WANT FROM YOU, OUR BROTHERS, ARE THOSE YOUNG GIRLS. SINCERELY SPEAKING, I ASK YOU TO SEND OUR GIRLS BACK, WE WILL CONSOLE OURSELVES WITH THEM. PLEASE RELEASE THEM TO US.------  THE SECOND POINT TO FINALISE MY TALK: IF WE WANT TO BE RECONCILED. YESTERDAY THE WHITE BULL WAS KILLED. I WILL GO BACK TO MY HOME AND SIT IN MY HOUSE, AND TRY TO BUY SIMPLE GOAT. MY TALK IS ENDED, BUT THIS POINT I WILL STRESS.----------  (GOES ACROSS THE ROOM TO PUT HIS HOUSE ON THE HEAD F THE OLD CHIEF. HE DID THIS TO SHOW THAT HIS HEART IS OPEN, HE HAS NOTHING REMAINING, BUT HIS HEART IS OPEN TO RECONCILIATION.)-----------  PNK: I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE WORD FROM CHIEF DUT YOL AND FOR THE GIFT HE HAS GIVEN CHIEF KUOL MUON. AT THE END OF HIS TALK, AND AS A SIGN OF HIS RECONCILIATION HE HAS OFFERED HIS HAD TO THE NUER CHIEF. NOW WE INVITE CHIEF GUM MADING AKUCBENY. WHILE WE RELAY OUR STORY TELLING ABOUT PAST EVENTS, WE ALSO WANT TO POINT TO ACTION WE NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE PEACE IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE BETWEEN GUM MADING AND CHIEF ... ONE HALF AN HOUR.----------  CHIEF GUM MADING AKUCBENY:---  FROM THE BEGINNING I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS (BEGINS TO SING HIS OWN SONG, TO WHICH PEOPLE RESPOND; BEGINS BY SAYING, "I AM GUM MADING . . ."). MY NAME IS CHIEF GUM MADING AKUCBENY. I THANK GOD AND THE NSCC FOR CHOOSING WUNLIT AS A LOCATION FOR THIS CONFERENCE. TO MY MIND A GENUINE RECONCILIATION WILL NOT INCLUDE ONLY D----&N, BUT IT MUST INCLUDE ALL SOUTHERN SUDANESE. THIS CONFERENCE HAS ALSO PROVIDED US WITH OPPORTUNITY-TO MEET WITH OUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FROM US IN-KHARTOUM WHOM WE'VE NOT MET FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THIS CONFERENCE HAS ALSO PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR KINFOLK IN EUROPE AND AMERICA TO COME SO THAT WE CAN MEET ONE ANOTHER. IT IS VERY GOOD THAT OUR CHILDREN WHOM WE'VE TAKEN TO SCHOOL TO LEARN ENGLISH AND ARABIC HAVE ALSO COME TO WUNLIT, AND THAT ALL PEOPLE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO HEAR THAT WE HAVE MET AT WUNLIT TO BRING PEACE TO THE LAND. YESTERDAY DURING THE OPENING THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES OF THE SPLA WERE HERE AND WE HAVE SEEN THEM. WE DID NOT, HOWEVER, KNOW THAT THERE WERE MILITARY AND CIVIL ADMINISTRATION FROM BENTIU WHO WERE LIKEWISE WITH US. WE ARE GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE IS A MILITARY COMMANDER COMING DIRECTLY FROM WHERE RIAK IS STAYING TO BE IN OUR DELIBERATIONS, AND THAT-HE WILL RETURN TO TELL RIAK OF OUR PROGRESS.------  THE FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, CONCERNS WE CHIEFS, WHO HAVE REMAINED WITH OUR PEOPLE IN S. SUDAN AND SENT OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS OR TO BILPHAM FOR TRAINING. THE-PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED AT BILPHAM DID NOT BEGIN THERE, BUT THEY ORIGINATED RIGHT HERE PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE. IN 1984 A GROUP OF YOUNG MEN FROM GOGRIAL AND TONJ BEGAN DEPARTING FOR BILPHAM. AS THEY WENT THEY NATURALLY HAD-TO PASS THROUGH NUERLAND. AS THEY REACHED ABUONG THEY WERE INTERCEPTED. MANY WERE KILLED AND OTHERS WERE DROWNED WHILE SOME RETURNED. THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEADERSHIP. IN THE SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION WE MUST BEGIN WITH THE GENESIS OF THE PROBLEM. IT IS NOT WITH THE LEADERSHIP. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE CHIEF WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING-OF OUR YOUNG MEN AS THEY WERE EN ROUTE TO BILPHAM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BEGIN WITH THE GENESIS OF THE PROBLEM. THAT IS WHY I ASKED FOR THE SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDER. THAT ROUTE THROUGH ABUONG BECAME UNSAFE FOR OUR THE PASSAGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND WE WERE FORCED TO MOVE ANY PARTIES THROUGH BOR AREA AS OUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. I CHALLENGE YOU, ASKING SOMEONE TO COME AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS NOT THE REAL STATE OF AFFAIRS, AS I HAVE DESCRIBED IT. THE ROUTE THROUGH BOR WAS A FAR LONGER ROUTE FOR OUR PEOPLE. WHEN WE DECIDE TO RECONCILE AND BECOME ONE, I MUST TELL YOU THAT, CURRENTLY, WE NOW HAVE TWO OF OUR PEOPLE WITH YOU IN NUER. THEY HAVE NOW DEVASTATED GOGRAIL, . . . AND TUIC AREAS. WHEN YOU PREPARED TO COME, DID YOU FIRST REALLY SPEAK WITH THEM TO ASK WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO. IF WE ARE SINCERE ABOUT RECONCILIATION I ADDRESS MYSELF TO THOSE FROM NUER AREA. YOU HAVE WITH US CARBINO KWANYINY BOL AND MATIP. DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE FOR US TO RECONCILE IF THEY ARE NOT WITH US, BECAUSE THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE WITH YOU NOW. IF WE RECONCILE WITHOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION I BELIEVE OUR EFFORTS WILL BE INCOMPLETE. S WE ARE ALL SOUTHERNERS, WE HAVE LOST OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, CATTLE AND PROPERTIES. I AM GLAD TO HERE THAT THE COMMISSIONER FROM BENTIU IS HERE WITH US. AS YOU SAW YESTERDAY, WE HAVE RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE WITH US HERE FROM OUR SIDE. I WOULD HOPE WE CAN ALSO SPEAK WITH RIAK MACHAR TO TELL HIM THAT WE AS SOUTHERNERS HAVE LOST EVERYTHING WE POSSESS THROUGH OUR CONFLICTS. FIRST LET US BE PRACTICAL, YOU THE CHIEFS FROM N AND FROM D. AS YOU HAVE SEEN YESTERDAY, WE DON'T HAVE AN ARMY. YESTERDAY GOVERNOR NHIAL DENG NHIAL AND COMMANDER SELVA KIIR WERE HERE TO GUARD ANY AGREEMENT WE COME TO IN THIS PLACE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHO WILL ENSURE THAT OUR AGREEMENT STANDS FIRM IN YOUR AREAS? WHEN CHIEF MAJOK CAME HERE . . . TELL ME, IF WE GO TO YOUR AREA WILL WE FIND THAT OUR DINKA ARE STILL ALIVE THERE? AS I SAID BEFORE, THE NUER ARE HERE WITH THEIR PROPERTY, THEY ARE HERE WITH THEIR CATTLE AND THEIR CHILDREN. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU ARE WELCOME TO TAKE THEM. BUT I WOULD ONLY ASK THAT YOU RECIPROCATE, ALLOWING OUR DINKA PEOPLE TO RETURN TO US ALSO. I CONCLUDE WITH GREETINGS, AND EMPHASISE BEFORE THE ORGANISERS, THAT THIS PEACE AND RECONCILIATION WILL BE MONITORED, SO THAT THE DINKA CAN GO TO NUERLAND AND CLAIM THEIR PROPERTIES AND LIKEWISE THE NUER CAN COME TO DINKALAND TO RECEIVE WHAT BELONGS FROM THEM.----------  PNK:---  I THANK THE TWO CHIEFS WHO HAVE SPOKEN NOW FOR THEIR PENETRATING INSIGHTS. I THANK THE NUER FOR LISTENING PATIENTLY TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE DINKA CHIEFS. AMONG THE SPEAKERS FROM TONJ COUNTRY IS SADIA . . . AND IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS CONFERENCE WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HEAR THE VOICE OF OUR WOMEN. WE WILL BEGIN TOMORROW AT 9:00 AGAIN HEARING THE NARRATIVES OF THE DINKA. WE WILL GIVE THREE HOURS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE DINKA. ALTHOUGH THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM TONG IS FINISHED, WILL GIVE A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY TO SADIA TO SPEAK. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
