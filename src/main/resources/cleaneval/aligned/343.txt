-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CASE FOR BILL BRADLEY------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BY ROBERT REICH------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WORKED CLOSELY-WITH AL GORE IN THE FIRST CLINTON ADMINISTRATION,---------------- AND I ADMIRE HIM. GORE IS-EARNEST AND-SMART. FOR-THE PAST SEVEN---------------- AND A HALF YEARS HE'S TAKEN ON GOD-AWFUL PROJECTS THAT NO ONE ELSE---------------- WANTED TO DO--LIKE "REINVENTING GOVERNMENT"--AND HAS DONE THEM WELL.---------------- HE'S BEEN LOYAL TO A FAULT. CONTRARY-TO HIS PUBLIC PERSONA, HE HAS---------------- A DROLL SENSE OF HUMOR THAT OCCASIONALLY TIPS INTO DEADPAN SARCASM.---------------- SO WHY DO I SUPPORT BILL BRADLEY? AND WHY DO I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT---------------- HIM, EVEN WHEN HIS BOAT SEEMS TO BE SINKING? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE---------------- I KEPT CLEAN FOR GENE, PASSED OUT LEAFLETS-AS A KID FOR STEVENSON,---------------- AND WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR WILSON IN------ I'M A SUCKER FOR DECENT,---------------- SMART, SOFT-SPOKEN IDEALISTS WITH LOFTY VISIONS ABOUT WHERE THE---------------- COUNTRY SHOULD GO AND WHAT WE CAN-DO TOGETHER. FOR GOOD OR ILL,---------------- THAT DESCRIPTION FITS BRADLEY, NOT GORE.------------------  START WITH THE ISSUES. I'LL SPARE YOU THE WONKY DETAILS ABOUT BRADLEY'S---------------- PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, CAMPAIGN FINANCE, GUN CONTROL,---------------- AND CHILD POVERTY. NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT THEM, WHICH IS PART---------------- OF BRADLEY'S PROBLEM. YET HIS ARE BY FAR THE BOLDEST AND MOST AMBITIOUS---------------- PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY ANY CANDIDATE IN THIS ELECTION.------------------- BRADLEY'S HEALTH CARE PLAN HAS TAKEN A-LOT OF KNOCKS FROM GORE,---------------- BUT THE CRITICISMS ARE UNFOUNDED. YES, THE BRADLEY PLAN WOULD END---------------- MEDICAID AS A SEPARATE PROGRAM. BUT THE ILL-FATED CLINTON-GORE HEALTH---------------- PLAN OF 1994 ALSO FOLDED MEDICAID INTO A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM, WHICH---------------- IS EXACTLY WHAT POOR PEOPLE NEED IF THEY WANT TO GET JOBS WITH BETTER---------------- WAGES AND NOT WORRY ABOUT LOSING THEIR COVERAGE. UNLIKE THE CONVOLUTED---------------- PLAN OF 1994, BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THE SAME SYSTEM THAT---------------- FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ALREADY USE, AND IT PROVIDES SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE---------------- BASED ON NEED. IT COVERS ALMOST EVERYBODY. BY COMPARISON, GORE'S---------------- NEW HEALTH CARE PLAN LEAVES MOST UNINSURED PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES---------------- OF 18 AND 55 STILL UNINSURED.------------------- GORE SAYS THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD BRADLEY'S PLAN, THAT IF WE TRIED---------------- TO FUND IT WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT OVER TO FIX MEDICARE.---------------- BUT, HELL, IF WE COULD AFFORD THE UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE THAT---------------- CLINTON AND GORE WERE PEDDLING IN 1994, WHEN THE FEDERAL DEFICIT---------------- WAS-STILL IN THE STRATOSPHERE, WE CAN AFFORD BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL---------------- NOW THAT WE'RE ENJOYING UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUSES. THE-NATION---------------- IS RICHER THAN IT'S EVER-BEEN. IF WE CAN'T GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH---------------- CARE NOW, WHEN CAN WE? BESIDES, THERE'S GREATER URGENCY-TODAY. WHEN-----------------THE CLINTON-GORE PLAN WAS-DREAMED UP,----MILLION AMERICANS LACKED---------------- HEALTH INSURANCE. NOW THE NUMBER IS--4 MILLION AND RISING.------------------ THE ONLY WAY WE COULDN'T AFFORD THE BRADLEY PLAN WOULD BE IF WE---------------- WERE TO USE-A BIG CHUNK OF THE SURPLUS TO ELIMINATE-THE FEDERAL-----------------DEBT, AS CLINTON AND GORE BOTH WANT TO DO. BUT GETTING RID OF THE-----------------NATIONAL DEBT SHOULD NOT BE A PRIORITY. AS-LONG AS THE DEBT DOESN'T ----------------RISE AS A PROPORTION OF NATIONAL PRODUCT (AND BY THAT MEASURE IT'S---------------- BEEN FALLING NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS), THE CRITICAL ISSUE ISN'T HOW---------------- LARGE IT IS IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS BUT WHAT THE BORROWED MONEY IS USED---------------- FOR. BORROWING TO GIVE AMERICANS HEALTHY BODIES AND OUR KIDS GOOD---------------- SCHOOLS IS A SOUND INVESTMENT THAT IS NO LESS IMPORTANT TO THE NATION'S---------------- FUTURE PROSPERITY THAN A FACTORY MADE SLIGHTLY CHEAPER TO BUILD---------------- BECAUSE INTEREST RATES WERE DRIVEN LOWER BY DEBT REPAYMENT. CLINTON---------------- TALKED THIS WAY IN------ BRADLEY IS TALKING THIS WAY NOW. GORE ISN'T.------------------- SURE, THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE FOR PAYING DOWN THE DEBT TEMPORARILY---------------- SO WE CAN ADD DEBT AGAIN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN BABY-BOOMER RETIREES---------------- BEGIN TO DRAW ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND BOOMER BODIES BEGIN DETERIORATING---------------- EN MASSE. BUT PRODUCTIVITY IS RISING SO FAST THAT THE NATION WILL---------------- PROBABLY BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF DODDERING BOOMERS WITHOUT ADDING---------------- MUCH DEBT. AND BESIDES, WEALTHY AMERICANS ARE BECOMING SO MUCH WEALTHIER---------------- THAT A TINY WEALTH TAX WOULD SUFFICE TO COVER THE BOOMERS EVEN IF---------------- PRODUCTIVITY GAINS DIDN'T. (LEST HE GET BLAMED FOR THIS HAREBRAINED---------------- REICH IDEA, BRADLEY HAS NOT-SUGGESTED IT.) THE POINT IS THAT WE---------------- CAN NOW AFFORD TO GET ON WITH THE GREAT UNFINISHED AGENDA. WE DON'T---------------- HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE DICK MORRIS POLICY MINIATURES THAT HAVE BEEN---------------- THE LEITMOTIV-OF CLINTON-AND GORE SINCE-------IDEAS THAT-SOUND GRAND---------------- BUT ARE WIMPY RELATIVE TO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE SUPPOSED---------------- TO ADDRESS. NOTHING-BOLD WILL HAPPEN AFTER JANUARY 2001 UNLESS A---------------- DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT-STIRS PUBLIC AMBITION DURING---------------- THE CAMPAIGN AND CREATES A MANDATE FOR IT TO HAPPEN.------------------- GORE SAID THE OTHER DAY THAT HE'D CONTINUE TO PAY-DOWN THE DEBT---------------- EVEN WHEN THE ECONOMY SLOWS, "JUST AS A CORPORATION HAS TO CUT EXPENSES---------------- IF REVENUES FALL OFF." HE ADDED THAT A RECESSION SHOULD BE VIEWED-----------------AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH CUTS FURTHER "BEFORE ANY-OTHER OPTIONS---------------- ARE CONSIDERED." THIS IS WORSE THAN REAGANOMICS. IT'S COOLIDGEOMICS.---------------- "HE SHOULD WASH HIS MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP," NOBEL LAUREATE ECONOMIST---------------- ROBERT SOLOW TOLD--- THE WALL STREET JOURNAL---- WHEN HE HEARD THIS---------------- STATEMENT. IF AMERICANS WANT TO ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THE---------------- DEBT MUST BE ELIMINATED AT ALL COSTS, LET THEM ELECT A REPUBLICAN.---------------- I PROMISE YOU HE'LL BE A ONE-TERMER. THE ECONOMY WILL SHRIVEL, AND---------------- THE DEMS WILL BE BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT EIGHT---------------- YEARS.-------------------------------------  IT'S NOT JUST HEALTH CARE AND THE BUDGET. GORE IS TO THE RIGHT---------------- OF BRADLEY ON ALMOST EVERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. BRADLEY WANTS TO HOLD---------------- MILITARY SPENDING WHERE IT IS-AND GIVE A BIG BOOST TO EDUCATION.---------------- GORE WANTS TO INCREASE MILITARY SPENDING BY $127 BILLION OVER THE---------------- NEXT DECADE--$12 BILLION MORE-THAN THE INCREASE HE PROPOSES FOR---------------- EDUCATION. BRADLEY VOTED AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN WELFARE PLAN, WHICH---------------- CLINTON ULTIMATELY SIGNED. GORE WAS FOR IT. (BEFORE YOU CONCLUDE---------------- THAT "WELFARE REFORM" WAS SUCCESSFUL AND BRADLEY'S VOTE AGAINST---------------- IT WAS A MISTAKE, WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT RECESSION WHEN---------------- THERE'S NO SAFETY NET FOR THE UNEMPLOYED POOR.) BRADLEY HAS COMMITTED---------------- HIMSELF TO LABOR-LAW REFORMS LIKE LARGE PENALTIES FOR EMPLOYERS---------------- WHO FIRE WORKERS FOR TRYING TO FORM UNIONS. GORE IS VAGUER ABOUT---------------- LABOR REFORM. AND SO-ON.------------------ NOW, YOU MAY BELIEVE THE NATION SHOULD MOVE FURTHER TO THE RIGHT.---------------- OR YOU MAY BE AMONG THOSE-WHO BELIEVE CLINTON HAS REPOSITIONED THE---------------- DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE CENTER AND-THEREBY BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO---------------- IT. BOTH ARE RESPECTABLE VIEWS IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES. BUT THEY IGNORE---------------- THE VAST AND GROWING PARTY OF NONVOTERS. MANY-OF THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T---------------- GET MUCH OUT OF THE 1990S BOOM. THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME, ADJUSTED---------------- FOR INFLATION, IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO,---------------- EVEN THOUGH THE MEDIAN FAMILY IS WORKING A TOTAL OF SIX-WEEKS LONGER---------------- EVERY-YEAR. A DEMOCRAT CAN IGNITE THESE NONVOTERS' PASSIONS AND---------------- INTERESTS ONLY WITH A LARGE VISION-OF WHAT WE-CAN DO TOGETHER AS---------------- A NATION, NOT-WITH PROMISES OF TEENSY INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS IN---------------- HEALTH CARE, WEENSY REFORMS OF SCHOOLS, MILITARY BUILDUPS, AND DEBT---------------- ELIMINATION.------------------- WHY DOES THE---------------------------------------------------- AFL-CIO----------------------- SUPPORT GORE OVER BRADLEY? I SUSPECT IT'S A MATTER-OF "THE DEVIL---------------- YOU KNOW...." MOST UNION PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN IN AND AROUND THE---------------- CLINTON-GORE WHITE-HOUSE SINCE JANUARY------ THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DELIGHTED-----------------WITH WHAT IT'S BROUGHT THEM, BUT THEY'D RATHER STICK WITH A SURE---------------- THING. AND THEY'VE CONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT, DESPITE-GORE'S LUKEWARM---------------- SUPPORT OF UNIONS IN THE PAST AND THE DOMINANCE OF ANTI-UNION DEMOCRATIC---------------- LEADERSHIP-COUNCIL FOLK IN GORE'S INNER-CIRCLE, AS PRESIDENT HE'D---------------- BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR CAUSE-THAN BRADLEY. I'M NOT SO SURE.---------------- LAST WEEK GORE TOLD THE---------------------------------------------------- AFL-CIO----------------------- EXECUTIVE COUNCIL THAT, IF THEY SUCCEEDED THIS YEAR IN DERAILING-----------------CHINA'S ADMISSION TO THE-WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, ONCE HE WAS ELECTED---------------- PRESIDENT HE'D SCRAP THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND NEGOTIATE A MUCH---------------- TOUGHER ONE, INCLUDING LABOR PROTECTIONS. BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY---------------- HE REASSURED WASHINGTON BUSINESS LOBBIES THAT HE WAS FULLY BEHIND---------------- THE CHINA TRADE DEAL THE WHITE HOUSE HAD NEGOTIATED. UNION LEADERS---------------- ARE WINKING AT ONE ANOTHER, THINKING THEY KNOW WHERE GORE REALLY---------------- STANDS. BUSINESS LEADERS ARE WINKING AT ONE ANOTHER, TOO, THINKING---------------- THEY KNOW. IS THIS CLEVER POLITICS ON GORE'S PART OR THE KIND OF---------------- SLICK DOUBLE-TALK THAT WOULD QUICKLY UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN A GORE---------------- ADMINISTRATION?------------------- LURKING BENEATH ALL THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES IS THE POISON OF MONEY---------------- IN POLITICS. HERE, AGAIN, BRADLEY IS A BOLDER REFORMER THAN GORE.---------------- BRADLEY IS CALLING NOT ONLY FOR AN END TO SOFT MONEY BUT FOR PUBLIC---------------- FINANCING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS,-INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE HOUSE AND---------------- SENATE. HE'S EVEN-PROPOSING A TWO-TO-ONE MATCH OF PRIVATE DONATIONS---------------- WITH PUBLIC FINANCING FOR PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. THIS GOES WAY---------------- BEYOND ANYTHING GORE, OR EVEN JOHN MCCAIN, HAS PROPOSED.------------------- BRADLEY ISN'T A SUDDEN CONVERT TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM--DESPITE---------------- GORE'S CLAIM ON "MEET THE PRESS" A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT BRADLEY "WENT---------------- SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE BEFORE HE EVER SPONSORED---------------- A CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL." QUITE THE CONTRARY: AS A SENATOR,---------------- BRADLEY JOINED IN SPONSORING CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILLS IN EACH---------------- OF SIX STRAIGHT CONGRESSES, FROM 1985-TO---96, INCLUDING THE MAIN-----------------CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILLS CONSIDERED AND-ACTED ON BY THE SENATE.---------------- IN 1991 HE WAS AN ORIGINAL COSPONSOR OF S.3, THE ONLY COMPREHENSIVE---------------- CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL TO PASS CONGRESS IN THE LAST QUARTER-CENTURY,---------------- WHICH WAS VETOED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE-BUSH. THEN-SENATOR GORE DID ----------------NOT COSPONSOR THIS BILL.------------------- INDEED, GORE HASN'T EXACTLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT---------------- OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE. BUDDHIST TEMPLES AND "NO CONTROLLING LEGAL---------------- AUTHORITY--ASIDE, HE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO ABOUT HIS ROLE IN---------------- A MORE SERIOUS BREACH OF THE SPIRIT, IF NOT THE LETTER, OF THE CAMPAIGN---------------- FINANCE LAWS.-STARTING WAY BEFORE THE 1996 GENERAL ELECTION, CLINTON---------------- AND, PRESUMABLY, HIS VICE PRESIDENT OVERSAW THE CREATION OF "ISSUE---------------- ADS" THAT BEAT UP ON BOB DOLE AND THE REPUBLICANS. THE ADS WERE---------------- DEVELOPED AND RUN BY THE SAME POLITICAL CONSULTANTS WHO DESIGNED---------------- THE OFFICIAL CLINTON-GORE CAMPAIGN ADS. BUT, RATHER THAN BEING PAID---------------- FOR BY THE CLINTON-GORE CAMPAIGN, WHICH HAD AGREED TO ABIDE BY SPENDING---------------- LIMITS, THE ADS WERE FUNDED WITH UNREGULATED MONEY FROM THE DEMOCRATIC---------------- NATIONAL COMMITTEE, WHICH RAKED IN ABOUT $1.5 MILLION A WEEK TO---------------- AIR THEM WHEREVER THEY'D HAVE THE MOST IMPACT.------------------ DOLE AND THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HIT---------------- THEM. BY THE TIME THEY WOKE UP, IT WAS TOO LATE. THE CLINTON-GORE---------------- LOOPHOLE NOT ONLY HELPED THE ADMINISTRATION-WIN THE 1996 ELECTION---------------- BUT THEREAFTER ESTABLISHED--SOFT MONEY--AS A SLUSH FUND FOR NEGATIVE---------------- POLITICAL ADVERTISING. THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOW FULLY INTENT ON EXPLOITING---------------- THE LOOPHOLE THIS TIME AROUND, TO THE TUNE OF AT LEAST $200 MILLION---------------- IF GEORGE W. BUSH EMERGES AS THE LIKELY NOMINEE. THAT'S ROUGHLY---------------- TWICE WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CAN POSSIBLY PULL IN.---------------- THE ONLY PROTECTION THE DEMS NOW HAVE-AGAINST THE-WEAPON CLINTON ----------------AND GORE CREATED IN---96 GOES BY-THE NAME-OF MCCAIN,-WHO HAS SWORN---------------- OFF SOFT MONEY.--------------------------------------- SOME PEOPLE SAY NONE OF THIS REALLY MATTERS. THIS CAMPAIGN IS---------------- ABOUT CHARACTER, AND THE "NEW," FEISTY GORE IS SIMPLY MORE APPEALING---------------- THAN THE RATHER IMPASSIVE BRADLEY. SIX MONTHS AGO GORE WAS PEDANTIC---------------- AND WOODEN, AND HIS CAMPAIGN WAS TOP-HEAVY WITH K STREET LOBBYISTS---------------- AND CORPORATE PUBLIC RELATIONS FLACKS. BUT, AS THE STORY GOES, GORE---------------- HAD THE COURAGE TO CHANGE. HE FIRED THE FLACKS, MOVED HIS HEADQUARTERS---------------- FROM WASHINGTON TO NASHVILLE, AND TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A HYPERKINETIC---------------- DYNAMO. BY CONTRAST, ALTHOUGH BRADLEY WAS HOT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,---------------- HIS STOLIDITY GOT BORING. HE DIDN'T FIGHT BACK HARD ENOUGH AGAINST---------------- GORE'S ATTACKS, HE LOST THE EXPECTATIONS GAME IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE,---------------- AND NOW THE MANTLE OF MAVERICK REFORMER HAS SHIFTED TO MCCAIN. AND---------------- BRADLEY STILL WON'T, OR CAN'T, REMAKE HIMSELF INTO A WINNER.------------------ SO, BY THE NEW TAUTOLOGICAL LOGIC OF PRESIDENTIAL "CHARACTER,----------------" BRADLEY DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES. HE'S TOAST UNLESS A MIRACLE---------------- HAPPENS: GORE SLIPS ON SOME BIT OF DUNG LEFT OVER FROM THE---------------- 1996 ELECTION, MCCAIN FIZZLES AND INDEPENDENTS SUDDENLY REDISCOVER BRADLEY,---------------- OR BRADLEY HIMSELF EMERGES FROM A TELEPHONE BOOTH AS A NEW, SUPERCHARGED---------------- BILL--SO FIERCE AND FIERY, SO SNAPPY AND WITTY, SO QUICK WITH MUD---------------- SLINGS, BARBS, ZINGERS, RIPOSTES, AND REPARTEES THAT HE OBLITERATES---------------- GORE IN UPCOMING DEBATES, DAZZLES THE PRESS, AND GETS HIS FACE ON---------------- THE FRONT OF EVERY NEWSWEEKLY IN THE COUNTRY. IN THIS POST-CLINTONIAN---------------- WORLD, SUCCESS IS CHARACTER, CHARACTER IS SUCCESS, AND MAKEOVERS---------------- CREATE COMEBACK KIDS--IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH WILL TO COME BACK IN ANY---------------- FORM THAT SUCCEEDS.------------------ THE ABILITY TO MAKE ONESELF OVER INTO A WINNING PERSONALITY ISN'T---------------- THE TRUE TEST OF CHARACTER, HOWEVER, AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THE CRITERION---------------- WE USE IN DECIDING ON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. CHARACTER---------------- HAS TO DO WITH CONSISTENCY, TRUTH-TELLING, FIDELITY TO PRINCIPLE,---------------- AND COURAGE. THESE WILL BE THE QUALITIES AMERICANS SEEK NEXT ELECTION---------------- DAY. MCCAIN'S APPEAL IS BASED ON THEM, AND, WERE HE TO EMERGE AS---------------- THE REPUBLICAN STANDARD-BEARER, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED.---------------- WHICH OF THE TWO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BEST MEASURES UP? TO MY MIND,---------------- BILL BRADLEY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ROBERT B.---------------- REICH-----------, SECRETARY OF LABOR IN THE FIRST CLINTON ADMINISTRATION,---------------- IS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY AT BRANDEIS---------------- UNIVERSITY AND NATIONAL EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN PROSPECT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
