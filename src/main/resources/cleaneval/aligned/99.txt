THE VIABILITY OF FREE SOFTWARE BUSINESS MODELS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BY HANS REISER---------------------------------------------------  SERVICE CONTRACTS--------  MAKING YOUR SOFTWARE FREE-MIGHT DECREASE YOUR SERVICE CONTRACTS-REVENUE.---  THE FREE SOFTWARE MOVEMENT IS QUICK TO CITE SERVICE CONTRACTS AS THE-BEST WAY TO MAKE MONEY FROM SELLING FREE SOFTWARE.- THERE IS A PROBLEM-WITH THAT.---  COMPANIES ARE QUICKER TO SPEND-MONEY ON SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR-PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE.-----THE TYPICAL LINUX SOFTWARE USING-COMPANY WILL HAVE SERVICE CONTRACTS-ON ITS SUN WORKSTATIONS INCLUDING THE-SOFTWARE, AND A HARDWARE ONLY-SERVICE CONTRACT ON ITS LINUX WORKSTATONS.- IT WILL HAVE SERVICE-CONTRACTS ON NETWORK APPLIANCE FILESERVERS, AND, WELL, THERE IS-EXACTLY ONE COMPANY (LYCOS-EUROPE) WITH A LARGE SERVICE CONTRACT ON-ITS REISERFS FILESERVERS.---  IF A LINUX USING COMPANY DOES HAVE SERVICE CONTRACTS ON ITS LINUX-WORKSTATIONS/APPLIANCES, MOST OF THE TIME THAT MONEY GOES TO SOME-INTERMEDIARY COMPANY WHICH DOESN'T GIVE ANY OF THE MONEY TO THE-AUTHORS OF THE SOFTWARE BEING SERVICED.---  THIS IS NOT RATIONAL ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR.- THE AUTHORS OF THE SOFTWARE-WILL INDEED GIVE MUCH MORE-EXPERT ADVICE THAN ANYONE ELSE.- THEY WILL-PROBABLY GIVE IT CHEAPER ALSO.- IT MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE WHATSOEVER-TO BE SLOWER TO BUY A SERVICE CONTRACT ON FREE SOFTWARE THAN ON-PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE IF YOU USE THE FREE SOFTWARE.---  IT IS VERY REAL BEHAVIOR THOUGH, AND IT IS KILLING OFF MANY FREE-SOFTWARE COMPANIES.- SOURCEFORGE WENT PROPRIETARY BECAUSE THEIR SALES-PEOPLE COULDN'T SELL SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR FREE SOFTWARE, AND MAKING-THE PREMIERE VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE PROPRIETARY MADE THE SERVICE-CONTRACT AN EASIER SALE.- GFS, BITKEEPER, HOW MANY PIECES OF SOFTWARE-MIGHT HAVE BEEN FREE IF THE SERVICE REVENUES HAD BEEN THERE?---  THIS IS DEEPLY ENDANGERING THE FREE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY'S FISCAL-VIABILITY.---  WHY ARE THEY RELUCTANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE ON SOMETHING THAT IS FREE?---  I GET SEVERAL EMAILS A DAY FROM USERS WHO WANT ME-TO TELL THEM-SOMETHING IN OUR FAQ, OR TO DIAGNOSE THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY RECOMPILE-THE KERNEL MODULE LIKE-THEY THOUGHT THEY DID, ETC.- I AM HAPPY TO DO-THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD-GET PAID FOR IT QUITE HONESTLY.-----  WE HAVE A SUPPORT PAGE WHICH HAS TO HAVE THE LOWEST FEE IN THE-INDUSTRY, $25 A QUESTION, AND WE'LL ANSWER ANY LINUX RELATED QUESTION-(THOUGH MOST OF THE-ONES WE GET ARE REISERFS RELATED QUITE NATURALLY.)-THIS SUPPORT WEBPAGE GETS USED ONCE EVERY SEVERAL DAYS.-----  I REFER THE EMAILERS WITH USER ERROR PROBLEMS TO THE SUPPORT PAGE.-(BUG REPORTS NOT IN THE FAQ WE HANDLE FOR FREE, THOUGH THE PROPRIETARY-GUYS LAUGH AND TELL ME THAT THEY CHARGE FOR BUG REPORTS ALSO.)- MAYBE---% OF THOSE EMAILERS WITH USER ERRORS SEND ME A FLAME BACK, ANGRY-THAT I WANT MONEY TO ANSWER A SIMPLE QUESTION THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER-TO.- THEY WOULDN'T SEND AN EMAIL LIKE THIS TO THEIR MEDICAL DOCTOR-EXPECTING A FREE DIAGNOSIS.---  SO WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN OUR INDUSTRY.- ECONOMICALLY IRRATIONAL-BEHAVIOR BY USERS IS KILLING OUR INDUSTRY'S REVENUES, AND IT-DEMOLISHED THE BUSINESS PLANS THAT ALL OF THOSE LINUX VCS FUNDED ONCE-AND SWORE TO NEVER FUND ANOTHER ONE LOOKING LIKE IT AGAIN.---  WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?---  THE ADVANTAGE THAT GNU/LINUX HAS IS PASSION.- WE NEED SOME FOCUSED-PASSION.- IF IT IS NOT LOGICAL, THEN WE NEED TO GET GOING WITH THE-PSYCHOLOGICAL-! IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF THE FREE SOFTWARE-MOVEMENT, THEN YOU NEED GO TO THE NEXT IT PURCHASES MEETING AT YOUR-COMPANY OR GOVERNMENT LAB, AND ASK IF THERE IS A SERVICE CONTRACT FROM-THE DEVELOPERS ON ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANTLY USED FREE SOFTWARE.- IT IS-THAT SIMPLE.---  WE NEED TO CREATE A CULTURAL NORM IN WHICH IT IS CONSIDERED PROPER-BEHAVIOR TO BUY SERVICE FROM FREE SOFTWARE AUTHORS WITH THE SAME-FREQUENCY ONE BUYS IT FROM PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AUTHORS.- THE WAY TO-DO IT IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A PROBLEM, AND START TELLING PEOPLE-BEING IRRATIONAL DOESN'T JUST LEAVE YOU LOSING THE COST OF YOUR TIME,-IT LEAVES YOU HURTING A MOVEMENT YOU CARE ABOUT.---  THERE ARE OTHER WAYS ALSO, BUT I DON'T FIND THEM AS-ATTRACTIVE.-----  MY GUESS IS THAT MOST OF THE REASON THE PROPRIETARY VENDORS SELL MORE-SERVICE CONTRACTS IS THAT USERS ARE MORE INCLINED TO BUY SERVICE WHEN-IT IS ONE MORE LINE ON A CONTRACT THAN WHEN IT IS A NEW-CONTRACT.---  AN ECONOMIST MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CALL THIS A TRANSACTION COST, AND-THINK RATIONAL BEHAVIOR-IS OCCURRING, BUT BEWARE THAT TEMPTATION-!THIS MARKETING PHENOMENOM HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE THE COST-OF SERVICE WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.- RATIONAL-ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR FOR THE CUSTOMER COMPANY AS A WHOLE IT IS NOT.---  WE COULD FOR INSTANCE MODIFY THE LICENSE TO REQUIRE USERS TO-PURCHASE ZERO OR MORE DOLLARS WORTH OF SERVICE FROM-THE SOFTWARE-AUTHORS (INCLUDING ISSUING A PURCHASE ORDER OR SUPPLY A CREDIT CARD-EVEN IF THE ORDER IS FOR ZERO DOLLARS). -I THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE-VENDORS WHOSE FREE SOFTWARE BUSINESS PLAN SERIOUSLY DEPENDS ON SERVICE-REVENUE SHOULD CONSIDER EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS.- ALTERNATIVELY, WE-SHOULD JUST NOT DEPEND ON SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE SUPPORT OF-FREE-SOFTWARE BUSINESSES. ----PERHAPS ONE CAN BETTER MAKE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM-SERVICE IF ONE'S PRODUCT IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH.- MYSQL SEEMS TO BE-MAKING THAT APPROACH WORK.- NAMESYS PLANS TO ADD DATABASE AND-HYPERTEXT FUNCTIONALITY TO REISERFS.- IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEDAY OUR-FILESYSTEM WILL OFFER SUFFICIENT FUNCTIONALITY THAT HAVING A NAMESYS-CONSULTANT WILL BE WORTHWHILE FOR THE AVERAGE FORTUNE 500 COMPANY.- IN-THAT CASE THE WHOLE REVENUE MODEL COULD SNOWBALL, WITH EACH CONSULTANT-CREATING MORE FEATURES, EACH NEW FEATURE CREATING MORE CUSTOMERS, AND-THE END RESULT COULD EVENTUALLY BE A COMPANY THE SIZE OF ANDERSON-CONSULTING ADVISING COMPANIES ON THEIR INFORMATION BASES.- WHILE THERE-IS NOTHING UNIQUE TO OPEN SOURCE ABOUT THIS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OPEN-SOURCE COULD ALLOW A FASTER INITIAL USER ADOPTION RATE.---  IT IS INTERESTING THAT FREE SOFTWARE SERVICE REVENUE AT THIS TIME-SEEMS TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION.- THIS IS NOT VERY-ENCOURAGING IF IT HOLDS TRUE FOR THE LONG TERM, AND WE END UP-WITH-PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE LOCKING-OUT COMPETITORS FROM-THE SOURCE CODE, AND-FREE SOFTWARE VENDORS EITHER NOT GIVING ANY OF THE REVENUE TO-DEVELOPERS (MOST SMALL VENDORS) OR BEING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED LARGE-VENDORS WHO FAVOR FUNDING SOFTWARE INTERNALLY DEVELOPED AND-CONTROLLED.- THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN A STATE CONTROLLED ECONOMY IS A-MONOPOLY CONTROLLED ECONOMY.-----  KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS BEING WRITTEN FROM A PERSPECTIVE IN THE-DEPTHS OF THE 2001 TECH BUST IN WHICH NAMESYS IS MANAGING "ONLY" A-100% ANNUAL GROWTH RATE DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE ECONOMY.- WHILE-REISERFS USAGE IS INCREASING BY ONE OR TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, ALL-NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES THAT WERE ON THE VERGE OF INCREASING REVENUE-BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DISAPPEARED AS THOSE CUSTOMERS ENTERED INTO-LAYOFFS.----  FREE SOFTWARE IS VERY EFFECTIVE AS A MARKET SAMPLING METHODOLOGY.------------------  THAT DOES IMPLY THOUGH THAT ONE MUST SEGMENT ONE'S MARKET.- ONE WAY TO-SEGMENT THE MARKET IS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE SOFTWARE IS INTEGRATED-WITH PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE.- OUR LICENSING POLICY SAYS THAT IF YOU-MAKE MONEY FROM CHARGING FOR USAGE LICENSES, THEN WE MUST MAKE MONEY-TOO.- THIS ALLOWS NAMESYS TO SELL TO FILESERVER VENDORS AND-PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE VENDORS WHO WANT TO ADD PROPRIETARY IMPROVEMENTS-TO REISERFS.- ALL SALES THAT NAMESYS HAS MADE IN THIS AREA HAVE-RESULTED FROM MARKET SAMPLING BEING VERY EFFECTIVE.- IT GENERATES FAR-MORE REVENUE AT THIS TIME THAN SERVICE DOES.---------------  SALES TO PROPRIETARY OS VENDORS HAVE NOT HAPPENED YET, BUT ONCE THE-ECONOMY RECOVERS THIS COULD CHANGE, AND INTEREST HAS BEEN EXPRESSED.-IT TAKES JUST ONE SALE OF THAT SIZE TO MAKE 8 YEARS OF WORK ON A HIGH-RISK TECHNOLOGICAL GAMBLE PAY OFF FINANCIALLY.---  OPEN SALES---------------  WE COULD MAKE PROPRIETARY OPTIONAL PLUGINS, WITH THE CORE FILESYSTEM-REMAINING GPL'D.- AN ISSUE THOUGH IS HOW TO PREVENT THE POOR FROM-BEING LOCKED OUT OF ACCESS TO SOFTWARE.- SOFTWARE FEES ARE USUALLY SET-TO WHAT AN AVERAGE MIDDLE-AGED MAN SPENDING HIS BOSS'S MONEY AT A US-CORPORATION WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY.- CURRENTLY THE ONLY REASONABLE-OPTION FOR THE POOR FOR MOST SOFTWARE IS TO PIRATE THEIR SOFTWARE.-(PIRATING CAN ALSO SERVE AS A FORM OF ANTI-TRUST VIGILANTE ACTION WHEN-THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS AS CORRUPTED AS IT IS IN THE US.)- MAKING-LICENSE FEES PROPORTIONAL TO STORAGE HARDWARE COST IS THE BEST WAY TO-HANDLE THIS.------------  THIS STILL LEAVES US WITH THE ECONOMIC INEFFICIENCY THAT-OCCURS WHEN A-USER NEEDS-A SPREADSHEET THREE TIMES A YEAR, AND HE WOULD LIKE TO USE-THE BEST ONE MADE, BUT THE BEST ONE IS PRICED APPROPRIATELY FOR THOSE-WHO USE IT SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.- I CALL THIS THE FOCUSED TAXATION-INEFFICIENCY.------------  MOST PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FOR MORE THAN THEIR MARGINAL COST BECAUSE MOST-REAL MARKETS ARE ONLY SEMI-COMPETITIVE.- DOING THIS DISTORTS THE-ECONOMY.- SOFTWARE TAKES THIS DISTORTION TO ITS GREATEST EXTREME, AND-BEST ILLUMINATES A LONGSTANDING INEFFICIENCY IN REAL WORLD SEMI-FREE-MARKET ECONOMICS.--------------  I HAVE AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS TO PUT BEFORE YOU: THE AMOUNT OF-ECONOMIC DISTORTION IS A FUNCTION OF NOT JUST THE TOTAL DOLLAR-AMOUNT-TRADED AND EXCEEDING THE-MARGINAL-COST, BUT IS A FUNCTION ALSO OF THE-RATIO OF PRICE TO MARGINAL COST, AND-HIGH-RATIOS ARE "TYPICALLY" MORE-DISTORTING THAN LOW-RATIOS, EVEN IF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DOLLARS IS-MADE EQUAL.- PERSONS INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING PROVING THIS HYPOTHESIS-ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMAIL ME AT REISER@NAMESYS.COM.- IF THE HYPOTHESIS-IS TRUE, THEN CAN WE-CHOOSE TO DEFOCUS THE DISINCENTIVE?--------------  CAN WE AVOID THE SERIOUS DISADVANTAGES OF A STATE CONTROLLED, OR-MONOPOLY CONTROLLED, ECONOMY, AND AVOID THE FOCUSED TAXATION-INEFFICIENCY AT THE SAME TIME?- HOW CAN WE LOCKOUT NEITHER POOR-CUSTOMERS NOR POOR STARTUP OS COMPONENT SUPPLIERS?----------------  I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THE CONCEPT OF OPEN SALES.- IN AN OPEN SALE,-USERS PAY A-FIXED PERCENTAGE OF HARDWARE COSTS AS A FEE FOR USING A-SOFTWARE POOL.--USERS MAY USE ALL SOFTWARE IN THE POOL.- THE USERS ARE-PRESENTED WITH A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THOSE DEVELOPERS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO-THE POOL, AND ASKED TO ALLOCATE THEIR FEE AMONG THE SAMPLE IN-PROPORTION TO THEIR PERCEIVED UTILITY.----  BENEFITS:-----  A DEFOCUSED DISINCENTIVE TO USE SOFTWARE.- YOU MAY USE THE BEST OF-ANYTHING IN THE POOL.----  POOR PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THE FEE.----  MORE FINEGRAINED REWARDING OF DEVELOPERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR-PRODUCTIVITY THAN TRADITIONAL COPYRIGHT LAW DUE TO REDUCED TRANSACTION-COSTS.----  MORE ACCURATE REWARDING DUE TO ASSESSMENT OF VALUE BEING MADE-AFTER USAGE.----------  CONCLUSION------------------  OPEN SOURCE IS A NICHE WE AT NAMESYS ENJOY INHABITING.- ITS PRODUCTION-IS NOT MOTIVATED MOSTLY BY MONEY.- IT-IS A GENTLEMAN'S HOBBY FOR MOST,-AND A PROFESSION FOR SOME WHO AREN'T IN IT FOR THE MONEY.- IT IS-LIKELY TO REMAIN A NICHE.- AS LONG AS THAT IS-UNDERSTOOD, A GOOD TIME-CAN BE HAD BY ALL US MUTANT HAIRLESS MONKEYS.- IT IS AMUSING TO GIVE-AWAY FOR FREE A FILESYSTEM FASTER THAN WHAT A COMPANY WORTH BILLIONS-IS ABLE TO WRITE DESPITE ALL THEIR MONEY. -LIFE SHOULD BE ENJOYED.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
