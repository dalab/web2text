WEAVER, WAS REMARKABLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FEATURE FILMS OF----- ITS TIME-BECAUSE OF-ITS NON-HOLLYWOODISH REFLECTION OF DAILY LIFE. [A RECORD----- OF SORTS, IT WAS THE ---FIRST---- US FEATURE FILM TO-SHOW A BATHROOM WITH----- A TOILET BOWL.-----------------------------] WITH A NOVICE ACTOR-(JAMES MURRAY) IN THE LEAD ROLE, THE FILM----- WAS SIMPLY A REALISTIC, BITTERSWEET DRAMA OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ORDINARY----- COMMON AND AVERAGE AMERICAN (AN-EVERYMAN PROTOTYPE EMBODIED IN A-WHITE-COLLAR----- WORKER) TRYING TO MAKE-IT WITH HIS WIFE IN THE MONOLITHIC BIG CITY---BUT WITHOUT------ANY-MAUDLIN SENTIMENTALITY, EXTREME PASSION, EXPLOITATION OF ROMANCE, OR ESCAPIST----- MELODRAMA. REALITY INTRUDES AS HE EXPERIENCES CRAMPED LIVING CONDITIONS, A----- BORING JOB, AND A LIMITED LIFE WITH REGRET AND BITTERNESS, RATHER THAN WHAT----- HE HAD EXPECTED.---------------------------------- VIDOR'S NATURAL AND UNCOMPROMISING FILM TELLS THE EPISODIC, POIGNANT STORY----- OF THE WORKING AND DOMESTIC LIFE OF AN AVERAGE, COMMONPLACE MAN IN 'THE CROWD'----- - JOHN - WITH HIS WIFE MARY (PLAYED EXQUISITELY BY THE DIRECTOR'S REAL-LIFE----- WIFE), CHRONICLING THEIR MEETING, COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, AND FAMILY LIFE. THE----- DIRECTOR ALSO CAST A VIRTUAL UNKNOWN NEWCOMER TO THE ROLE OF THE HUSBAND IN----- HIS CANDID VIEW OF THE AVERAGE MAN - A CHARACTER LOST IN THE MIDST OF THE----- FACELESS MASSES. THE FILM'S DIRECTOR REFUSED TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE HARSH----- REALITIES OF LIFE FOR THE WORKADAY COUPLE, EITHER BY CONDEMNING OR CELEBRATING----- THE GLOOM OF THE BLEAK TRAGEDY BEFALLING THEM. INSTEAD, HE VISUALLY AND ELOQUENTLY----- CAPTURED THEIR BELIEVABLE HUMAN STRUGGLE AS THEY LIVED THEIR UNIDEALIZED LIVES----- AND CONFRONTED-DISAPPOINTING SETBACKS, THE TRAGIC DEATH OF THEIR DAUGHTER,----- DASHED HOPES AND BRIEF TRIUMPHS, AND EVENTUALLY FOUND COMFORT-IN THE ANONYMITY----- OF THE MASSES, WATCHING AN UNFUNNY THEATRICAL CLOWN ACT.------- TO CAPTURE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE CITY, THE DIRECTOR SOMETIMES USED A 'HIDDEN----- CAMERA' IN HIS ON-LOCATION SHOOTS IN NEW YORK. STYLISTICALLY, THE FILM, IN----- VARIOUS PLACES, RESEMBLES THE GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST FILMS OF F. W. MURNAU AND----- FRITZ LANG, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO USES FLUID AND NATURAL CAMERA MOVEMENTS. KING----- VIDOR RECEIVED AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION AS BEST DIRECTOR, AND THE FILM----- ITSELF WAS NOMINATED AS BEST UNIQUE AND ARTISTIC PICTURE IN A SHORT-LIVED----- AWARD CATEGORY. SIX YEARS LATER, VIDOR INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCED AND DIRECTED----- A 'TALKIE' SEQUEL TO--- THE CROWD---- (INTENDED AS PART OF A FILM TRILOGY)----- TITLED--- OUR DAILY BREAD (1934)---- - IT WAS A DEPRESSION-ERA, HARD-TIMES----- SOCIAL DRAMA ABOUT AN IDEALISTIC MAN WHO WAS-RUNNING A FARM COOPERATIVE ORGANIZED----- AS A SOCIALISTIC SOCIETY - IN THE COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE CROWD.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE FILM'S OPENING TITLE HERALDS THE CELEBRATION OF JULY 4TH IN AN ANONYMOUS----- TOWN IN THE YEAR 1900:-----------------------THE NATION-ON HOLIDAY!

TO-ACCENTUATE THE CLAUSTROPHOBIC, NARROW CORRIDOR OF THE HOME'S----- STAIRCASE, THE CAMERA IS PLACED IN A FIXED POSITION AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS----- FOR THE SUSTAINED SHOT. NO LONGER CONFIDENT, JOHNNY IS A TINY-FIGURE IN THE----- LONG, TAPERING CONFINES OF THE BOXY ENTRYWAY WITH WALLS THAT STRETCH AWAY----- - HE IS PAINFULLY OVERWHELMED BY THE FUNNELLING VOID OF HIS FAMILIAR FLIGHT----- OF STAIRS. HE LEAVES THE PEOPLE CROWDED AND HUDDLED AT THE DOORWAY AND TENTATIVELY----- STARTS THE LONG CLIMB UP THE STEEP STEPS TO THE TOP - TO-HIS QUESTIONABLE----- FUTURE. AT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP, HE PAUSES - A FEMALE RELATIVE FROM -----ABOVE COMES DOWN TO HIM, CRADLES HIM, AND TELLS THE NEWLY-ORPHANED BOY OF----- HIS FATHER'S PREMATURE DEATH:---------------------- YOU MUST BE BRAVE NOW, LITTLE MAN...LIKE YOUR FATHER WOULD WANT----- YOU TO BE.------------------- "WHEN JOHN WAS TWENTY-ONE HE BECAME ONE OF THE SEVEN MILLION THAT BELIEVE----- NEW YORK DEPENDS ON THEM." TO BRAVELY FACE HIS FUTURE, CLAIM HIS BIRTHRIGHT----- AND SEEK THE DREAM HIS FATHER ALWAYS WANTED FOR HIM, 21 YEAR OLD JOHN RIDES----- THE FERRY TO NEW YORK (MANHATTAN) WITH HIS NAME-LABELED SUITCASE UNDER HIS----- ARM - AT THE FERRY RAILING WHILE LOOKING AT THE SKYLINE, A GAUNT PASSENGER----- CYNICALLY AND OMINOUSLY WARNS THE NAIVE YET AMBITIOUS YOUNG MAN OF THE DEPERSONALIZED----- METROPOLIS AND THE MYTH OF ADVANCEMENT THERE:---------------------- PASSENGER: YOU'VE GOTTA BE GOOD IN THAT TOWN IF YOU WANT TO BEAT----- THE CROWD.-------- JOHNNY: MAYBE...BUT ALL I WANT IS AN OPPORTUNITY.------------------- IN HIS SOBERING SEARCH FOR FAME AND FORTUNE, JOHN IS IMMEDIATELY SUBMERGED----- IN THE NEW CAPITALISTIC, UNCARING ENVIRONMENT - WITH ITS MASSIVE CONFUSION----- AND OVERPOWERING SIZE. THE MONTAGE OF THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE CITY SYMBOLIZES----- HOW ENGULFED, SURROUNDED, ISOLATED AND INSIGNIFICANT HE IS - EVERYTHING IS----- SHOT FROM HIS POINT OF-VIEW. [HIGH SKYSCRAPERS AND TRAFFIC IN A BUSTLING,----- CROWDED CITY WAS A NOVELTY IN 192-.] FROM A HIGH ANGLE, CROWDS OF SCURRYING----- PEDESTRIANS CROSS THE CITY BLOCK AT W 45TH. CARS AND BUS-TRAFFIC OVERWHELM----- THE THOROUGHFARE. AN ENDLESS MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, CARS, VEHICLES, AND ELEVATED----- TRAINS SPEED BY. SMOKESTACKS SPEW PLUMES OF WHITE SMOKE FROM SKYSCRAPER TOPS------AND FROM TUGBOATS IN THE HARBOR. THE CAMERA MOVES FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK -----TO ENCOMPASS THE EXHILARATING SCOPE AND VASTNESS OF THE CITY, FILLED WITH----- BEEHIVES OF WORKERS. THEN, AIMED AT THE TOP OF A TALL OFFICE BUILDING, IT----- ROTATES IN A DIZZYING CLOCKWISE TURN.------- ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPRESSIONISTIC TRACKING SHOTS IN ALL OF CINEMATIC HISTORY----- BEGINS AT THE STREET LEVEL. THE MAJESTIC SHOT TILTS UPWARD AND SMOOTHLY TRAVELS----- UP THE FLAT OUTSIDE SURFACE OF A STONE WALL OF A MULTI-WINDOWED SKYSCRAPER----- - ONE OF MANY IN THE CITY. SUDDENLY, THE OFFICE BUILDING RISES AND STRAIGHTENS----- UP OUTSIDE ONE FLOOR, AND TRANSPORTS THE VIEWER DIRECTLY INTO ONE-OF ITS WINDOWS.------IN A-DISSOLVE, THE CAMERA SLIDES THROUGH THE-WINDOW INTO A LARGE ROOM FILLED----- WITH A MONOTONOUS CRISS-CROSSING OF HUNDREDS-OF ROWS OF-IDENTICAL OFFICE DESKS----- AND WORKERS. THE CAMERA SWEEPS-ACROSS THE-INFINITE SEA OF ANONYMOUS, BUSINESS-ATTIRED----- INSURANCE-COMPANY PAPER-PUSHERS UNTIL IT ZOOMS IN ON OUR HERO - ONE OF MANY----- WAGE-SLAVES SEATED AMIDST HUNDREDS OF OTHER OBEDIENT AND COWED CLERKS. ANOTHER----- FACELESS VICTIM OF THE CITY, JOHN SIMS' (JAMES MURRAY) DESK IS LABELED (IN----- CLOSEUP): "JOHN SIMS 137." [IN----------------------- THE APARTMENT (1960)--------,----- DIRECTOR BILLY WILDER PAID HOMAGE TO THIS IMAGE OF A SEA OF DESKS FOR ANONYMOUS----- WORKERS.-------] HE HAS IN HIS HAND A TORN NEWSPAPER AD WITH AN OFFER FOR "ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS----- CASH PRIZE" IF HE CAN WIN THE PRODUCT-NAMING CONTEST FOR THE SYLVANIAN OIL----- COMPANY IN NEW YORK: "GIVE US A NAME FOR OUR NEW MOTOR FUEL.- A FEW OF HIS----- CLEVER, INVENTIVE IDEAS ARE 'PETROL-PEP' AND 'JAZZ-O-LENE.' IMPATIENTLY, HE----- WATCHES THE WALL CLOCK-- IT IS A FEW MINUTES BEFORE---PM. HIS LIFE'S COMINGS----- AND GOINGS ARE DICTATED BY THE GIANT TIME-PIECE. WHEN THE MINUTE HAND MOVES----- TO 5, THE AUTOMATON WORKERS LEAP UP AND SCURRY AWAY FROM THEIR DESKS FOR THE----- EXIT AND SWARM THROUGH OFFICE DOORS. IN THE WASHROOM, THE LIKEABLE YOUNG OFFICE----- WORKER FRESHENS UP AND-COMBS HIS HAIR, AND IS AGGRAVATED WHEN TOLD IDENTICAL----- THINGS BY FOUR DIFFERENT COLLEAGUES: "WASHIN' 'EM UP, SIMS?", "TAKIN' A WASH,----- SIMS?", "SCRUBBIN' 'EM UP, SIMS?", AND "CHASIN' THE DIRT, SIMS?----------------------" YOU BIRDS HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE SO LONG THAT YOU ALL TALK ALIKE-------------------!
