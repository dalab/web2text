HIS BRAIN DAMAGE WAS THE CAUSE OF A----- BULLET FRAGMENT SHOT INTO HIS BRAIN DURING WAR. FROM THEN ON Z----- SUFFERED IMPAIRMENT OF VISION, LOSS OF MEMORY AND ABILITY TO SPEAK,----- READ AND WRITE. THE BOOK--THE-MAN WITH THE-SHATTERED WORLD' DESCRIBES----- HOW-THIS COURAGEOUS MAN RELEARNS TO IDENTIFY, RECALL AND UNDERSTAND THE----- WAY TO SPEAK, READ AND WRITE.-------- FIRSTLY, Z'S ABILITY TO SEE WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY RUINED. HIS VISION----- WORKED IN VERY MYSTERIOUS WAYS. HE COULD NO LONGER SEE A WHOLE SINGLE----- OBJECT. INSTEAD, HIS EYES SAW THE LEFT SIDE OF OBJECTS; THE RIGHT SIDE----- OF THINGS DIDN'T SEEM TO EXIST. FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE PICKED UP A SPOON----- HE COULD ONLY SEE PART OF IT. HIS VISION-WAS NOT THE SAME AS YOURS OR----- MINE; IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. TO HIM THE THINGS OTHERS WOULD SEE----- WOULD JUST BE A SWARM OF FUZZINESS. A PICTURE APPEARED TO BE UPSIDE----- DOWN, INSIDE OUT, LOP SIDED AND ANY OTHER WAY IT COULD BE DISTORTED.----- IF THINGS DID SEEM TO BE FUZZY, WHAT HE DID SEE WAS ONLY HALF AS MUCH----- AS SOMEONE ELSE WOULD SEE; HE HAD A SMALL SPAN OF VISION.-------- NOT ONLY WERE REAL SITUATIONS MUFFLED BY HIS VISION BUT SO WERE -----IMAGINARY SITUATIONS. Z SUFFERED HALLUCINATIONS BECAUSE THE DAMAGED----- AREA OF THE BRAIN STIMULATED THE NERVE CELLS THAT RETAIN VISUAL----- MEMORIES. IT WAS AS THOUGH THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BODY DIDN'T EXIST.----------- HE COULDN'T SEE IT SO EVERY TIME HE WALKED-ALONG HE BUMPED INTO WALLS----- AS A RESULT. VISION WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY DIFFICULTIES Z SUFFERED.-------- DUE TO THE BRAIN DAMAGE HIS `SENSE OF BODY' CHANGED-AS WELL AS-HIS----- REACTIONS. IN FACT, HE HAD NO SENSE OF HIS BODY INCLUDING OTHER OBJECTS----- AROUND HIM. HE LOSES THE SIGHT OF HIS RIGHT-SIDE BECAUSE HE FORGETS HE----- CAN'T SEE-THAT SIDE;-THIS IS BECAUSE OF T AT OTHER TIMES Z WAS UNAWARE----- OF THE POSITIONING OF HIS BODY'S PARTS.----------- IF HE-CLOSED HIS-EYES HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHERE HIS RIGHT LEG WAS.----------- HE HAD TO SEARCH FOR PARTS OF HIS BODY LIKE SEPARATE PIECES.----- SURPRISINGLY IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SHOW HIS DOCTOR WHERE HIS BACK----- WAS. IN ADDITION HE'D FORGOTTEN A LOT OF THE NAMES FOR PARTS OF HIS----- BODY; IT WOULD TAKE HIM LITERALLY HOURS TO REMEMBER. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE----- FOR Z TO POINT OUT SOMETHING QUICKLY BECAUSE HE GOT ALL CONFUSED. FOR----- EXAMPLE IF THE DOCTOR SAID `HANDS ON YOUR HIPS', HE WOULD BE LEFT ALL----- BEWILDERED.-------- ANOTHER MISFORTUNE WAS FORGETTING HOW HIS BODY FUNCTIONED LIKE GOING TO----- THE TOILET AND FORGETTING HOW TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. THE TIME----- WHEN HE NEEDED THE TOILET IN HOSPITAL WAS FRUSTRATING FOR Z BECAUSE----- HE'D FORGOTTEN HOW TO GET THE NURSE'S ATTENTION. THE PHYSICAL STRAINS----- WERE JUST TOO MUCH FOR HIM AS HE GOT TIRED VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY.-------- SENSE OF SPACE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY Z FACED. GENERALLY, HE HAD NO----- SENSE OF IT AND COULDN'T JUDGE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THINGS. HE----- PERCEIVED THE WORLD AS BROKEN INTO THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE PARTS.----- MISJUDGING THE POSITION OF OBJECTS WAS ONE OF HIS FAULTS. FOR EXAMPLE----- IF HE WANTED TO SIT DOWN HE WOULD MISJUDGE WHEREABOUTS THE CHAIR WAS----- AND WHERE HE WAS. THE SAME DIFFICULTY OCCURRED WITH CLASPING HANDS;----- HE COULDN'T USE HIS RIGHT HAND BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE IT. THIS SEEMED----- TO BE A SITUATION OF `OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND'.-------- DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS THESE RAN INTO THOSE USING OBJECTS. Z FORGOT HOW----- TO USE SIMPLE THINGS. IF HE WAS GIVEN A NEEDLE AND THREAD IN HOSPITAL----- WORKSHOPS HE WOULD JUST SIT THERE FOR AGES TO WORKOUT HOW TO USE THEM.----- THEY LOOKED FAMILIAR BUT HE JUST FORGOT HOW TO USE THEM. MORE----- MISJUDGMENTS OF THE POSITION OF OBJECTS LEAD TO PROBLEMS. FOR EXAMPLE----- WHEN HE WENT TO-AXE A STUMP OF WOOD HE WOULD JUST HIT THE FLOOR OR HIS----- FOOT INSTEAD. THINGS SEEMED SO PECULIAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS AFRAID TO----- REACH OUT AND TOUCH THINGS IN HIS ROOM.----------- HE LIVED IN A WORLD THAT SEEMED TO HAVE DISINTEGRATED; THE SIMPLEST----- THINGS BECAME SO COMPLEX. Z HAD TO SEARCH FOR EVERYTHING AS LURIA----- DESCRIBES,'HE MENTALLY PROBED EACH OBJECT AS THOUGH HE WERE A BLINDFOLDED----- MAN GROPING HIS WAY THROUGH SPACE'. IT WAS JUST ONE BIG MAZE-FOR HIM----- BECAUSE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ORIENT HIMSELF IN SPACE, TELL FROM LEFT OR----- RIGHT OR GAUGE DISTANCE AND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 2 OBJECTS. Z COULDN'T----- EVEN WORKOUT WHERE A SOUND WAS COMING FROM BECAUSE HE'D LOST SPATIAL----- ORIENTATION.-------- HIS ABILITY TO READ ALSO SUFFERED GREAT PROBLEMS. IT WOULD TAKE HIM----- HOURS TO READ SOMETHING LET ALONE UNDERSTAND IT. ONCE, HIS FAMILY----- BOUGHT A-NEW STOVE;-HE-SPENT WEEKS-TRYING TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE----- INSTRUCTION BOOKLET THAT EVENTUALLY HE WAS CONVINCED THE STOVE WAS----- FAULTY. HIS CONCENTRATION TO READ WAS TOO HARD SO HE AVOIDED IT WHEN----- HE COULD. GENERALLY, HE COULDN'T READ; HE WAS ILLITERATE AND COULDN'T----- REMEMBER THE ALPHABET. HOWEVER, HE ATTEMPTED TO RELEARN THIS SKILL.----- BY THE THIRD LESSON HE COULD REMEMBER THE LETTERS M AND A BUT NOT----- IMMEDIATELY; HE PROGRESSED VERY SLOWLY. HE ESPECIALLY FOUND IT VERY----- DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THE LETTERS S, K AND M. SO, HE TRIED TO----- ASSOCIATE WORDS WITH THEM BUT HE COULD ONLY REMEMBER THESE FOR A COUPLE----- OF MINUTES. FOR HIM TO REMEMBER WORDS, HE FOUND IT GOOD TO RECITE THE----- OUT LOUD. B READING WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR Z. IT WASN'T UNTIL A FEW----- MONTHS THAT HE KNEW THE WHOLE ALPHABET; EVEN STILL HE COULDN'T RECALL----- IT IMMEDIATELY. HIS VISUAL SPAN WAS LIMITED SO HIS READING-SUFFERED----- SUBSEQUENTLY. Z COULDN'T SEE AN-ENTIRE WORD, HE HAD TO READ-EACH----- LETTER. IN ORDER TO READ HE WOULD HAVE TO FOCUS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT------AND ABOVE A LETTER TO SEE IT. HE COULD ONLY READ THREE LETTERS AT----- A TIME. READING WAS SO SLOW FOR HIM ; WHEN HE GOT TO THE THIRD WORD OF----- A SENTENCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WORDS BEFORE SO HE'D START AGAIN. AS A----- RESULT,-HE READ REALLY SLOWLY AND BECAME VERY IRRITATED-PLUS THE FACT----- THAT HE COULDN'T READ OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE.-------- READING WAS JUST PART OF Z'S-PROBLEM WITH LETTERS AND WORDS. TO FIND----- OUT HE COULD NO LONGER WRITE WAS ALSO DEVASTATING SEEING AS HE USED----- THIS ALL THE TIME IN HIS STUDIES. FOR ONE THE SIMPLE TASK OF ACTUALLY----- HOLDING A PENCIL WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. HE LITERALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO----- DO THIS AND WRITE LETTERS. EVEN IF HE DID MANAGE TO WRITE SOMETHING HE----- WASN'T IN ANY FIT STATE TO READ WHAT HE'D WRITTEN.----------- THE PROGRESS OF HIS WRITING WAS THE SAME AS HIS PROGRESS TO READ, THAT----- BEING SLOW. IT TOOK HIM SIX MONTHS TO READ AND WRITE WITH INTENSIVE----- PRACTICE. Z MISSED OUT A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT DETAILS OUT WHEN HE----- WROTE. PUNCTUATION WASN'T PRESENT IN HIS WRITING AS HE'D FORGOTTEN ANY----- KIN OF RULE. GRAMMAR WAS ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLE TO GET OVER. THE----- INJURY HIS BRAIN WAS LEFT WITH WAS COULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO OPERATE WITH----- LANGUAGE. TOO COMPLEX SYNTACTICAL PATTERNS ARE FAR TOO DIFFICULT FOR A----- PATIENT TO GRASP WHO CAN'T EVEN GRASP THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF WORDS----- AND WORKOUT WHAT THEY IMPLY. FOR INSTANCE, Z MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT-------BROTHER' AND `FATHER' MEAN BUT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT----- `BROTHER'S FATHER' MEANT. HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND VERY SHORT -----SENTENCES.-------- WRITING WAS SUCH A LONG PAINFUL PROCESS. HE SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS----- WRITING HIS JOURNAL. IT WOULD LITERALLY TAKE ONE DAY TO WRITE HALF OR----- ONE FULL PAGE. THIS WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE. HE----- DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO LINK ONE SENTENCE-WITH ANOTHER AND SO CONSEQUENTLY----- WROTE DISJOINTED PHRASES AND CLAUSES. HIS LACK OF MEMORY-AFFECTED HIS----- ABILITY TO WRITE. IT WOULD TAKE HIM AGES TO TO REMEMBER WORDS; EVERY----- WORD WAS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE. THE SUBJECT HE WAS ACTUALLY WRITING----- ABOUT ALSO SLIPPED FROM HIS MEMORY. AS A RESULT HE OFTEN REPEATED WHAT----- HE'D WRITTEN BECAUSE HE'D FORGOTTEN HE'D ALREADY WRITTEN IT. SOON, HE----- NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH, MEMORY, THOUGHTS OR IDEAS TO CARRY ON----- WRITING HIS LIFE STORY. IN FACT, WRITING TOOK LONGER AND LONGER TOWARDS----- THE END OF HIS JOURNAL.-------- ALL OF THESE DIFFICULTIES Z SUFFERED FROM WERE DUE TO MAJOR LOSS OF----- MEMORY. IN THE BEGINNING, JUST AFTER BEING WOUNDED, HE COULDN'T EVEN----- REMEMBER HIS OWN NAME AND THE VILLAGE THAT HE LIVED IN. NAMES WOULD BE----- LINGERING IN HIS-MIND READY-TO BE SPOKEN, ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE.----- IF HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO TO REMEMBER THINGS HE WOULD FIND IT EXTREMELY------DIFFICULT TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS. BUT WHEN HE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO BE----- THINKING OF IT HE SUDDENLY FOUND WORDS COMING TO HIM. FOR EXAMPLE,----- FAMILIAR TUNES WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR IN HIS HEAD. EVEN SO, HIS MEMORY----- WAS STILL VERY BAD. IT WAS ALSO SHATTERED INTO SMALL PIECES LIKE THE----- REST OF HIS WORLD.-------- AS Z'S MEMORY WAS SO BAD, THIS PREVENTED HIM FROM EVER STUDYING----- ANYTHING HE'D ONCE LEARNT AS A STUDENT. HIS MEMORY EVEN AFFECTED HIM------IN EVERY DAY SITUATIONS. IT WAS A CONSTANT STRAIN FOR HIM-TO THINK AND----- REMEMBER THE WORDS PEOPLE SPOKE AND ANSWER BACK-AT THE SAME TIME. HE----- WAS CONSTANTLY FORGETTING. EVERY DAY SIMPLE CHORES WOULD BE DELAYED AS----- A RESULT OF HIS MEMORY. FOR INSTANCE, HE WOULD GO TO THE BARN FOR SOME------COAL AND FORGET-THE KEY; BUT AS SOON AS HE WENT BACK FOR IT HE'D FORGET----- WHY HE WAS THERE. HIS MAIN TROUBLE WAS AMNESIA AND FORGETFULNESS.-------- EVEN THOUGH HIS MEMORY WAS-SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED THERE WERE SOME THINGS HE----- COULD REMEMBER MORE THAN OTHERS. HE FOUND IT-FAR EASIER TO REMEMBER----- THINGS FROM FAR BACK IN THE PAST-LIKE HIS KINDERGARTEN BUILDING. THE----- FUNNY THING WAS HE HAD TROUBLE REMEMBERING THE-RECENT PAST. AS HE------STATED ,'MY MEMORIES CAME BACK FROM THE WRONG-END'. INSTEAD OF RECENT----- SITUATIONS BEING EASILY REMEMBER Z COULD RECOLLECT CHILDHOOD MEMORIES----- WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION. WHEREAS SIMPLE COMMON MEMORIES SUCH AS -----REMEMBERING WHAT A CAT OR DOG LOOKED LIKE WAS VERY HARD FOR Z. HE----- COULDN'T EVEN VISUALISE FACES FROM HIS OWN FAMILY BUT HE IMMEDIATELY----- RECOGNISED THEM.-------- GENERALLY, Z'S PREVIOUS EFFORT TO ACQUIRE-USEFUL KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN------POINTLESS.-EVERYTHING HE'D LEARNT AT SCHOOL HAD GONE. LANGUAGES HE'D------LEARNT AT SCHOOL LIKE GERMAN AND ENGLISH HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN. AS WELL------AS USING FOREIGN LANGUAGES HIS USE OF ARITHMETIC HAD ALSO GONE.----- UNFORTUNATELY, Z HAD FORGOTTEN HOW TO COUNT. HE WAS UNABLE TO COUNT----- BACK CHANGE GIVEN TO HIM IN A SHOP. ALL THOSE EVERYDAY THINGS THAT YOU----- OR I FIND SIMPLE, HE FINDS COMPLEX. HE-HAS TO LOOK LIFE VERY SIMPLY IN----- A WAY THAT A YOUNG CHILD WOULD.-------- EVEN THOUGH Z HAS TRIED FOR-YEARS TO IMPROVE HIMSELF, IN REALITY HIS----- WOUND HAS CAUSED MAJOR BRAIN DAMAGE. DAMAGED-AREAS OF THE CEREBRAL----- CORTEX COULD NOT BE RESTORED. IMPROVEMENTS HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN MADE----- ALTHOUGH HE HAS-ADJUSTED TO-HIS BODY PECULIARITIES BUT THEY STILL ANNOY----- HIM IF HE'S SUFFERING AN ATTACK. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS WITH `SPACE' -----CONTINUED-FOR YEARS.-HE WAS UNABLE TO ORIENT HIMSELF IN HIS OWN HOME----- SETTLEMENT.-------- WHEN IT CAME TO READING AND-WRITING, HE DID ACTUALLY TEACH HIMSELF HOW----- TO DO THESE SKILLS AGAIN. HOWEVER, IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME. AS YOU----- KNOW IT TOOK HIM 25 YEARS TO WRITE HIS JOURNAL AT ONE-PAGE A DAY-AT THE----- MOST. THE CONTENT OF HIS WRITING DIDN'T REALLY IMPROVE AS HIS EFFORT------TO EXPRESS-HIMSELF BECAME NO SIMPLER. ALTHOUGH, HIS SPEAKING IMPROVED.----- BUT HIS WORLD CONTINUED TO BE ALIEN AND FRAGMENTED. NOTHING ALTERED----- HIS TRAGIC STATE OF MEMORY. SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT Z NEVER REALLY----- OVERCAME HIS TROUBLE OF MEMORY. INSTEAD HE JUST CONSTANTLY TRIED TO----- IMPROVE THINGS.-IN REALITY-HE WAS FACED WITH A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF LIFE----- WHICH HAD NO REAL END.-------- BIBLIOGRAPHY--THE MAN WITH A SHATTERED WORLD' BY A.R LURIA-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
