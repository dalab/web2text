modest.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□CLOTHING GUIDELINES□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□What will you wear to Europe? This is a major concern, but it
is□secondary. The real question is □□□□□□ how much? You are
infinitely□better off going with nothing but an umbrella and a
toothbrush than□with the load you would typically bring on a vacation
in the United□States.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Pack Light□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□As every traveler and chronicler of the subject relates,□pack light.
Seldom does anyone define the meaning of pack light,□except to present
a list of clothes and accessories to bring, no□such list ever being
universally practical. To enjoy travel, you□must pack light. To define
pack light, travel with your chosen load□and see for yourself if it is
convenient and gives you the freedom□you need.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Dress Sharp□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□It pays to be well presented, with a European flavor.□Europeans are
clothes conscious. Northern Europeans look somber,□while brighter
colors are more common as you go south. Clothes□represent personality
and social status. People wear□their better clothes almost all the
time.
□□□□□□□□□Europeans seeing you for the first time and only briefly□will judge you
completely by your appearance, and will behave□accordingly.
Unfortunately for the traveler, most of your personal□contact in Europe
will be with hotel clerks and cafe waiters. To□secure a good room, good
table, and good service, dress as if you□deserve it. In fact, you will
be stopped at the door of many places□if you are not properly dressed.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Be Comfortable□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□In addition, you must keep yourself comfortable. Northern□European
weather is generally cooler, wetter, and more variable□than in the
United States. South of the Alps and Pyrenees it can be□warm and stuffy
just about any time of the year. Walking in and out□of museums,
restaurants, and stores may force you to off and on□your coat. In
stores the heat from those little halogen lamps can□be very
uncomfortable. Be ready for rain or shine, hot or cold.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Pack Light Field Test□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I propose the following test, preferably taken in a light□rain.
□□□□□□□□□Pack everything, put on your hat and coat, open your□umbrella, (raining
or not), check the time, and walk one mile away□from home with
everything you have. Then, pretending you are trying□to catch a train
or trying to get to the tourist office before it□closes, run or walk
home. If you can make the round trip□comfortably within 45 minutes, you
have packed light. It is best if□your test course includes a short,
steep hill or several flights of□stairs, upwards on the return leg.
□□□□□□□□□Also make sure that all of your traveling companions can□pass the pack
light field test. If not, old friends may become□lifetime enemies.
Failure to obey the pack light rule will doom you□in so many ways that
you will be better off to stay home and water□your tomatoes. Those
taking a cruise or tour may think that they□can escape this rule, but
be aware that porters and taxis are□usually scarce and/or expensive.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□RECOMMENDED CLOTHING□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Rules for the easy traveler, then, are rather formidable:
□□□□□□□□Pack light
□□□□□□□Dress sharp□□□□□□□
Be comfortable
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Typical Tourist Clothing□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The clothes worn by most American tourists announce them as□Americans
better than any trilingual poster ever could. From the□ground up you're
wearing: jogger or tennis shoes, worn Levi's,□collared tee shirt, and
ski jacket, with a backpack. If you are□past the age of backpacks, your
oversized plastic suitcase will□even more effectively identify you as
an American.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Go Like a Local□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□For a number of reasons you are better off looking like a□local citizen
rather than a standard American tourist. Don't  misinterpret this. I
love the USA and all that it  represents, but I try to avoid being an
American billboard when I  travel overseas. The primary reason is to
avoid being a target of  pickpockets, a breed endemic in Europe. You
might also think that  it could avoid being caught up in terrorist
bombings as London had  in July 2005. That is probably not an issue
since the murdering  sons of bitches just kill anybody, including
fellow Muslims praying  at their local mosque.
□□□□□□□□□For many years my personal preference was a pair□of black slip-on
shoes, wool/polyester blend slacks, turtleneck□shirt, and sport coat.
This ensemble will get you through almost□any door in Europe with
reasonable respect, keep you comfortable□under most weather conditions,
and allow you to blend in without□being instantly identified as "the
American."
□□□□□□□□□□The wool/polyester blend slacks look more like wool than□plastic, but
they wash drip dry. You won't need to iron these□if you care for them
according to the label. Levi Strauss has introduced  a new Dockers line
available in several colors besides the normal khaki.  A couple of
pairs of the dark charcoal served me well throughout Europe  on my
January 2006 trip. Turtleneck shirts are□not common in America. In fact
I couldn't find a single one in December 2005.  The men's shops all
said that they weren't in style this year. Booosh! You can find them
in□ski clothing shops. If you are not in ski country get catalogs from
Lands End  and from L.L Bean for a good selection. I ended up buying  a
couple of good cotton T-necks at the V+D department store after I
arrived in Holland.  An open collar dress shirt is a good substitute
for the turtleneck in warmer weather.  In very few restaurants is a tie
required, though you'll see them  often in better establishments. For
off-season travel, I also bring a  lightweight turtleneck sweater.  My
sport coat has a herringbone pattern and travels very well□without
showing wrinkles or minor stains.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Levi's□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Levi's and other brands of denim jeans became fashionable in□Europe in
the 1990's. Levi's are now tolerated in many caf□□□□□□□□s□and restaurants
during the day. However, regular slacks are much□more common as street
wear in major cities throughout Europe. Based on my  observations of
people walking through the central train stations of Europe  less than
20% were wearing denim jeans. The preference  for the vast majority,
men and women, young and old, was black slacks.
□□□□□□□□□□Slacks are also much more in harmony with packing light. Levi's
are□heavy and bulky, and take a day to dry out when they get rained on.
If you do  wear denim, select a lightweight pair with a bit of fashion.
You might want  to consider wearing Levi slacks rather than Levi jeans.
Levi Strauss  makes a good looking line called "Action Slacks." These
are 100% Dacron  and travel very well. Wash them off in the shower at
night and hang them to  drip dry by morning. I have a couple pairs in
black. I recently switched to another  Levi Strauss product for my
European travels and everyday wear. These are  charcoal Dockers, 55%
cotton and  45% MicroPolyester, style number 405189256. They are very
comfortable  and look like dress slacks.
□□□□□□□□□□When strolling in major cities in the summer a lightweight pair of
black slacks  or skirt plus a white top will serve you well. This  is
standard attire for a large percentage of the native populations, and
tourists from  other European countries.
□□□□□□□□□□I have no ambition of being a clothing cop so accept this chapter as
you will.  The advice is based on my personal experience in Europe.

Yeah sure, you can wear your back yard jeans or shorts, t-shirt or no
shirt,  sneakers or flip flops,  and that is the way you will be viewed
and treated in the cosmopolitan  cities throughout Europe. Expect no
respect.
□□□□□□□□□□Dressing well does not have to apply only to Europe. I had drifted
into wearing  Levis at my local pub in Michigan a few years ago. One
night last summer I was  returning home from an event where I was
wearing a jacket and slacks and decided to stop in at  Oscar's, my
regular place, to shoot some eight ball. It wasn't long before a young

lady about half my age started bumping into me and making strong eye
contact. After that  I started wearing slacks and a dress shirt when I
went to Oscar's. Approachments by young dames has happened  again and
again to the point that it has become  embarrassing, but I won't brag
on it. Guys, listen up here! Dress sharp and you  won't need all those
bull drop lines to meet a girl in Europe, or anywhere.
□□□□□□□□□□I would expect that a woman dressed in Levi's would normally be
approached by a man  in more or less the same low-life outfit. It's
only speculation, but I guess that if you  want to meet the prince of
your dreams in Europe you would dress to the nines. Why not? Besides,

women in Levi's are about the most asexual creatures on the earth. I
don't know why girls wear Levis. They are so unflattering to the
derri□□□□□□□□re.□ And it won't cost you much to dress better. It will probably
cost you less than that name brand stuff. Think,  have you been to your
local second hand store recently. They  have some great stuff at
laughingly ridiculous low prices. You will want to tell your  friends,
as I have just done. Male speaking, I just bought a London Fog brand,
zipper in liner,□trench coat for $40. It looks better than the the one
in my closet that I bought 15 years ago  for $140. Well, I must admit
that it is a bit out of fashion. Most coats in Europe are black and
the length is just above the knee, so this thing is the wrong color
and a foot too long per current styles.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Layers□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Dress in "layers." This means dressing in items that can be added to
or□removed individually without changing everything when the
weather□changes. For example, instead of a heavy overcoat wear a
sweater and a windbreaker.  If it gets too warm in the afternoon take
off the sweater and carry it in a shopping bag. □ Dressing in layers
requires that all of your clothes be complementary□and mixable. Dark,
neutral, and earth colors tend to avoid fashion□clashes, and do not
need cleaning as often as lighter colors.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Shoes□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□In Europe you'll notice all sorts of footwear □□□□□□ boots,□clogs, tennis,
joggers, sandals, army issue, and Italian fashion.□Many people will see
and examine your shoes before their eyes come□up to meet yours, if they
ever do.
□□□□□□□□□□Appearance is important.□Wear a good looking, durable, broken-in pair
of shoes. Your average□American department store shoes will probably be
mistaken for□Italian fashion. Perfect. An average pair of polished
black  slip-ons will get you in the door anywhere. Also, rubber soles
will□survive far better than leather soles on the rain soaked
sidewalks□of Europe.
□□□□□□□□□Instead of shoes, I have become a convert to sandals, more□specifically
Birkenstocks, a German brand. Once you break in a pair□of Birkenstocks
you will never go back to shoes again, except for□during stormy
weather. You won't even want to go barefoot again.  Birkenstocks have a
half inch of cork between the hard rubber bottom and the  leather part
you rest your feet in. Cork is very easy to walk on. You can  go all
day in these things. I  recommend black socks with the Birkenstocks,
unless you are at the beach.  Birkenstocks are expensive so you can
make this one of your purchases when  in Germany, at prices 50% less
than the American prices.
□□□□□□□□□□Carry an extra pair of shoes since it is likely that your□shoes will
get soaked occasionally. If you invest in a pair with□natural leather
uppers, you can oil them to the point that they□resist water like wax
paper. Use mink oil or equivalent once a□week.
□□□□□□□□□Again, do not wear any kind of sports shoes, e.g. tennis,□jogging, or
whatever else they call them these days. I was with□some business
associates in The Hague a few years ago and we□decided to take a pub
crawl. Two of them had just bought new jogger□shoes and wore these out
for the evening stroll. Several places□would not allow them in the
door. These places were just your□average Dutch caf□□□□□□□□s and bars, not
fancy or up-scale. And□my associates were businessmen in their 50s,
certainly good potential□customers in any establishment. Those doormen
want to keep their jobs so they keep the□off-spec people outside.
Nothing looks clunkier than fresh□white tennies. I've heard that the
French call them marshmellows.  In my Amsterdam and Brussels train
station observations,  jogger shoes were worn by less than 5% of those
passing through, usually  by young people with backpacks.
□□□□□□□□□An alternative for those who like tennies is the Florsheim line  of
shoes called "Comfortech." These are light weight black slip-ons with
a cushion  bottom. They look great at a distance and will get you past
any maitre d'  or doorman.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Rain Gear□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Weather protection is essential. Bring a telescoping□umbrella. You can
find umbrellas which slide down to under 10 inches.  A lightweight
hooded mackintosh is very□handy for those frequent all day rains. A
light pair of leather□gloves and a hat are helpful for off-season
travel, and can even be□useful in northern Europe in the summer.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□WOMEN'S WEAR□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Friends who have read this book often say that it is overly male
oriented. A major reason,□perhaps, is my discussion of clothing, but
the attitude probably□surfaces in other areas as well. I've seen
packing lists  on the internet written by women who must have had a
platoon on hand to carry  their utterly essential stuff. Some girls
claim that they simply can't□travel with only a carry-on bag, and some
bring everything□but the kitchen sink on a weekend sortie.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Here's How□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I used to travel like that but learned the hard way how to□do it the
easy way. For a weekend trip to Paris with my Dutch girl□friend many
years ago I packed two suitcases with six days worth of□extra clothes
and other just-in-case stuff and drove over to pick her up.□I was
amazed. She wore a black jumpsuit, colorful scarf, a  fashionable
raincoat, and carried a slightly□oversized purse with everything she
needed. Although our room was a  nice one in an above average□hotel,
there was hardly enough space to hang my things or stash the□suitcases.
My precious Paris time was wasted putting things away,□deciding what to
wear, and repacking everything.
□□□□□□□□□Women writers can give you□plenty of tips for advice on how to pack
light. For encouragement and advice, ladies□should consult the books of
Mesdames □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Dena Kaye,□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Georgia Hesse□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□, □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Louise Purwin Zobel □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□, □and □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Eleanor

every  country in Europe.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Friendly Helpers□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Pack light girls. Yes, you can do it. Yes, you must.
□□□□□□□□□In fact it is more important for women to pack light than□for men. Remember □□□□□□ if you pack it you carry it, you burro□you. And if you have
too much and some helpful stranger offers to□give you a hand in a train
station or tourist office, chances are nine out□of ten that he is
helping himself. You might have nothing left to□carry when he is done
with you.
□□□□□□□□□□You wonder why a guy would steal a□woman's suitcase? He probably has a
girl friend who would be□overjoyed with some American clothes and
toiletries. If your□suitcase takes a walk, I hope that you didn't hide
your money and□passport in it; cash, I.D., and clothes □□□□□□ what a score!
I wrote  this paragraph decades ago and recently saw the film "French
Kiss" with  Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan. It is a hoot for Francophiles and
graphically  illustrates my point. I give Kevin first billing for his
great characterization.
□□□□□□□□□□By the way, when the friendly helper is done with your□suitcase, you
might look to see if you still have a purse. One of□his buddies
standing nearby probably picked that off as the first□cavalier
distracted you with his charming accented English. This□scenario sounds
a little harsh, but this is the real world, not the□fantasy feely-good
world created by most travel writers. See□chapter 8 for advice on
avoiding Jesse James and the□bandit gangs. They're everywhere, and they
rarely work alone.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□BUSINESS WEAR□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Casual is not cool.
□□□□□□□□□□□□No Dockers□□□□□□□□□□□□□Americans traveling to Europe on business must wear their□best.
Impression is critical in doing business overseas. If you□wear khaki
Dockers to work because they are so□comfortable, put them aside for
your trip. A dark plain lightweight  wool suit will be accepted for
all□occasions. Use it for after work social events as well.
□□□□□□□□□□□□The Tie Is the Thing□□□□□□□□□□□□□White shirts are fine and are always OK. You'll see many men  wearing
colors. I prefer a light blue. Ties from the top fashion names,  or
knock-offs, are the order of the day.
□□□□□□□□□□□□Women on Business□□□□□□□□□□□□□Ladies, please please please leave your Madeline Albright suits
at□home. Better yet just throw them in the trash. Those tight
pastel□skirts and jackets are screaming yuk absolutely horrible.
□□□□□□□□□□What you should do is pack a neutral dark pants□suit, a few of your
best blouses, and a couple of splashy scarves or a string of pearls. I

am so happy that our present Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice,

looks right sharp all over the world, and presents an image  that all
Americans can really be proud of. She is cool, so cool. Imitate her

and you won't go wrong.
□□□□□□□□□□Bring only the jewelry  that you can afford to have stolen.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□BEACH WEAR□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Speedos are the tradional beach wear for men in Europe. Younger
fellows have taken up  with California surfer style trunks which they
wear over the speedos.□□Women normally wear one piece and two piece
suits as in the USA. However a large percentage of  women leave the top
half of the bikini at home. Topless girls are everywhere. And the

tonga is popular, showing 99% of the derri□□□□□□□□re and leaving not much to
the imagination.
□□□□□□□□□
To leave even less to the imagination and not wear anything go to one
of the nude beaches.  Going naked is allowed on designated coastal
beaches and inland waterways throughout Europe.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□LAUNDRY□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Unfortunately you do have to wash your clothes while□traveling. There
are several ways to get it done. In packing light you need only 3 days

worth of everything plus the clothes on your back. This means a
laundry job  twice a week.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Hotel Service□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
In standard tourist class hotels you rarely see a laundry□bag, a normal
item in American motels. When I have found the□laundry bag in Europe I
almost used it for something else after□reading the prices. It would be
cheaper to buy new clothes at□American prices, but you won't find
American prices in Europe. If□the hotel does not have a cleaning or
laundry service, the desk□clerk will be able to direct you to a dry
cleaner or laundromat.
□□□□□□□□□
If you are on an extended business trip you probably must□use the hotel
service because you don't have time to do it□yourself. Some miserly
Dilbert managers will single out this item□on your expense report and
try to disallow it. Stand your ground.
□□□□□□□□□
When having dry cleaning done, make sure that cleaning is□done and not
just pressing. Write down the native word for□cleaning. If there are
spots or stains, point them out to the□attendant. Spot removal can't be
guaranteed because the spot may be□due to loss of dye rather than
misdirected spaghetti sauce or wine.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Hostel "Service"□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you are using hostels as you travel, for the economy or the
camaraderie, you are likely to find a washing machine in a side room.
This will be one of the most convenient and cheapest opportunities for
washing your clothes. If you are traveling in high season you may have
to wait in line to use the machine.
□□□□□□□□□
These facilities will be strictly self-service. If you don't
understand the workings of the machine, ask. If you put your stuff in
and come back six hours later you can expect to see your clothes
dumped on any adjacent table or chair. Someone else needed to wash. Do
likewise if you need to, but ask the manager first. Just because the
machine has stopped does not mean that the wash is finished. It may be
on one of its pauses.
□□□□□□□□□
Before starting ask what the fee is if it is not posted. You may or
may not need to furnish your own suds.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Laundromats□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Public laundromats are usually attended, sometimes are coin□operated,
normally have restricted hours, and are typically closed one or two
days a□week. European machines are smaller than American ones and take
one hour□or more per load. Part way through the wash cycle the
machine□pauses for an extended soak.
□□□□□□□□□
If you allow the laundromat to do□the wash for you the attendant will
set the temperature depending□on the color of your clothes. Attendants
follow the rules on the□machine, period. Your permanent press white
shirts will probably be□boiled and returned as permanently wrinkled. I
suggest that you do□it yourself in a coin machine. If you can't read
the directions,□ask around to see if someone speaks English. If that
fails, watch□the others. Temperatures are in Celsius, a.k.a.
centigrade. For□information on Celsius see □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□chapter 27□□□□, "The Metric
System in Europe."
□□□□□□□□□□
The price of one load of wash can be three dollars or more.□Detergent
will be available, either in single load sizes from a□coin automat or
free from a soap tub in the laundromat.
□□□□□□□□□
Dryers are similar to ours so you should have no□difficulty. Dryers
normally run on a ten minute cycle and the cost□is reasonable.
□□□□□□□□□Lonely Planet is the only guide book series which locates□laundromats
in the major cities. Use their maps and legend to find□a place to wash
your clothes. You don't necessarily want to ask□your hotel. The manager
may direct you to one of his associates or□sub-contractors. That is not
always your best deal.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Wash Basin or Bidet□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□It's the old fashioned way. If you do not want to go to a□laundromat
then you must scrub, soak, rinse, wring, and hang to dry.
□□□□□□□□□□Almost every hotel room in France is posted, "Don't wash□your clothes
in the room, and don't eat in the room" □□□□□□ free□translation from □□□□le fran□□□□□□□□ais□□□□□ (French). My theory is□that if no drip marks or crumbs are
left on the floor, the spirit□of the hotel keeper's request is honored.
Hand washing clothes in□your room will certainly save you money, will
probably occupy less of□your time, and will relieve you of the
uncertainty of delay due to□sometimes service. Picnicking in your room
has exactly the same  benefits. See chapter 15, "Eating Your Way
Through Europe."
□□□□□□□□□Instead of doing your laundry in the wash basin, use the□bidet. A
letter from a reader of an earlier edition asked if this□is sanitary.
The bidet is clean so why not? You can let your□laundry soak for a
while and still be able to brush your teeth and□wash your face.
□□□□□□□□□
Wring out your□underwear and hang it over the usually present radiator.
It will be□warm and dry by morning. But dust off the radiator first.
And do□the wash early in the evening since the heat is often turned off
at□night and then comes back on for a few hours in the morning.
□□□□□□□□□
One challenge to the scrub-it-yourselfer will be in hanging your
clothes  if they are still  dripping. This applies to slacks, skirts,
shirts, blouses, and other  outer-wear. If you have no bathtub or
shower in the room, use a□newspaper to catch the drips. Sometimes a bit
of ingenuity will be□needed to figure out what to tie your line on.
Some rooms are□almost impossible. Strapping tape can sometimes come to
the rescue. □See □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□chapter 6□□□□, "A Packing List for Europe."□Take your wash
down in the morning so that the chambermaid doesn't observe. You
don't□need a confrontation with the hotel keeper. If your clothes are
still damp just hang □ them in the closet, if there is one.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□BUYING EUROPEAN CLOTHES□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Buying clothes in Europe can be a challenge. Clothing is□cut
differently, partly for style and partly to fit the build of□the
average citizen. This varies considerably from country to□country.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Size Conversion Tables□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Take care in using the clothing size conversion tables□presented in
travel books. Tables differ. Sales clerks are seldom□knowledgeable or
helpful on this. They know less about American□sizes than you can learn
about European sizes. Size tables are□posted in some of the large
department stores, though in some□stores I have seen conflicting
conversion tables for American to□European sizes on the wall and on
garment packages. I have bought□the same size under shorts with the
same brand name in two different□European countries. One was loose and
one was tight.
□□□□□□□□□□□□The True Test□□□□□□□□□□□□□If you buy clothes in Europe, have yourself measured by a□competent
salesperson, if you can find one. Measurements and sizes will normally
be in□centimeters. See □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□chapter 27□□□□, "The Metric System in Europe" if you
don't know what this is. □ Men's shirt sleeves are measured□from the
shoulders, not the spine. Also try the garment on.□Ascertain whether or
not it will shrink when washed. Cotton items□purchased in Europe will
probably shrink. Buy something a size too big, maybe two sizes over.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□HAIR□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Although it is not something that most of us pack for a□trip, hair is
an important part of your wardrobe in the context of□your appearance.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Men□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The long grizzly look is characteristic of laborers and□dopey students,
just as it is in the United States. Before you go,□get a haircut. Short
hair is much easier to take care of, an□important consideration while
traveling. But, don't get a military□trim. That's too short.
□□□□□□□□□The morning shave is probably the one thing most men wish□they could do
without, but it might be better to continue shaving.□Beards invoke
suspicion in many people (e.g., customs agents and□airport security
folks), fear in some (e.g., young women), and instant□dislike in most
of the rest (e.g., hotel clerks and maitres d').□You don't need hassles
and rejections from these folks while you□are traveling. But then
again, wearing a beard saves time and trouble  in the morning so make
your own call on this. Try to keep it neatly  trimmed if you have a
beard. I have had a beard for many years, on and off.□I put up with the
hassles for the convenience of avoiding the morning scrape. □See □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□chapter 6□□□□, "A Packing List for Europe" to learn a better way to shave
□□□□□□□ with vinegar.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Women□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Traditionally, European women do not shave their legs. But they□seldom
show much leg (except at the beach) since their dresses and skirts

overlap their boots. An American woman traveling in Europe could□easily
escape the regular leg shaving. In addition, many European  women do
not shave under their arms. These traditions are crumbling and  women
generally shave these days. Whether or not to  go traditional is a
