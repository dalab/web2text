 CHAPTER -------------------------------------------------------(WITHOUT PHOTOS)-------------- OF------------------ HOW TO EUROPE-------------------------- THE COMPLETE-TRAVELERS HANDBOOK--------------------------------------------------- INTERNET EDITION.------------------------------------------------------------- A PAGE FROM---------------------------------------------------------------- ENJOY-EUROPE.COM------------------------------------------------------BY---------------------------------------------------------------------------- JOHN BERMONT-----------------------------------------------------  DO NOT WEAR THE EMPEROR'S CLOTHES. PUT ON SOMETHING A-LITTLE MORE MODEST.------------------ CLOTHING GUIDELINES------------------ WHAT WILL YOU WEAR TO EUROPE? THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN, BUT IT-IS-SECONDARY.-THE REAL QUESTION IS------- HOW MUCH?-YOU ARE INFINITELY-BETTER OFF GOING WITH NOTHING BUT AN UMBRELLA AND A TOOTHBRUSH THAN-WITH-THE LOAD YOU WOULD TYPICALLY BRING ON A VACATION IN THE UNITED-STATES.----------------- PACK LIGHT------------------- AS EVERY TRAVELER AND CHRONICLER OF THE SUBJECT RELATES,-PACK LIGHT. SELDOM DOES ANYONE DEFINE THE MEANING OF PACK LIGHT,-EXCEPT TO PRESENT A LIST OF CLOTHES AND ACCESSORIES-TO BRING, NO-SUCH LIST EVER BEING UNIVERSALLY PRACTICAL. TO ENJOY TRAVEL, YOU-MUST PACK LIGHT. TO DEFINE PACK LIGHT, TRAVEL WITH YOUR CHOSEN LOAD-AND SEE FOR YOURSELF IF IT IS CONVENIENT AND GIVES YOU THE FREEDOM-YOU NEED.----------------- DRESS SHARP------------------- IT PAYS TO BE WELL PRESENTED, WITH-A EUROPEAN FLAVOR.-EUROPEANS ARE CLOTHES CONSCIOUS. NORTHERN EUROPEANS LOOK SOMBER,-WHILE BRIGHTER COLORS-ARE MORE COMMON AS YOU GO SOUTH. CLOTHES-REPRESENT PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL STATUS. PEOPLE WEAR-THEIR BETTER CLOTHES ALMOST ALL THE TIME.--------- EUROPEANS SEEING YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME AND ONLY BRIEFLY-WILL JUDGE YOU COMPLETELY BY YOUR APPEARANCE, AND WILL BEHAVE-ACCORDINGLY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE TRAVELER, MOST OF YOUR PERSONAL-CONTACT IN EUROPE WILL BE WITH HOTEL CLERKS AND CAFE WAITERS. TO-SECURE A GOOD ROOM, GOOD TABLE, AND GOOD SERVICE, DRESS AS IF YOU-DESERVE IT. IN FACT, YOU WILL BE STOPPED AT THE DOOR OF MANY PLACES-IF YOU ARE NOT PROPERLY DRESSED.----------------- BE COMFORTABLE------------------- IN ADDITION, YOU MUST KEEP YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. NORTHERN-EUROPEAN WEATHER IS GENERALLY COOLER, WETTER, AND MORE VARIABLE-THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. SOUTH OF THE ALPS AND PYRENEES IT CAN BE-WARM AND STUFFY JUST ABOUT ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. WALKING IN AND OUT-OF MUSEUMS, RESTAURANTS, AND STORES MAY FORCE YOU TO OFF AND ON-YOUR COAT. IN STORES THE HEAT FROM THOSE LITTLE HALOGEN LAMPS CAN-BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. BE READY FOR RAIN OR SHINE, HOT OR COLD.----------------- PACK LIGHT FIELD TEST------------------- I PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING TEST, PREFERABLY TAKEN IN A LIGHT-RAIN.--------- PACK EVERYTHING, PUT ON YOUR HAT AND COAT, OPEN YOUR-UMBRELLA, (RAINING OR NOT), CHECK THE TIME, AND WALK ONE MILE AWAY-FROM HOME WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. THEN, PRETENDING YOU ARE TRYING-TO CATCH A TRAIN OR TRYING TO GET TO THE TOURIST OFFICE BEFORE IT-CLOSES, RUN OR WALK HOME. IF YOU CAN MAKE THE ROUND TRIP-COMFORTABLY WITHIN 45 MINUTES, YOU HAVE PACKED LIGHT. IT IS BEST IF-YOUR TEST COURSE INCLUDES A SHORT, STEEP HILL OR SEVERAL FLIGHTS OF-STAIRS, UPWARDS ON THE RETURN LEG.--------- ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS CAN-PASS THE PACK LIGHT FIELD TEST. IF NOT, OLD FRIENDS MAY BECOME-LIFETIME ENEMIES. FAILURE TO OBEY THE PACK LIGHT RULE WILL DOOM YOU-IN SO MANY WAYS THAT YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF TO STAY HOME AND WATER-YOUR TOMATOES. THOSE TAKING A CRUISE OR TOUR MAY THINK THAT THEY-CAN ESCAPE THIS RULE, BUT BE AWARE THAT PORTERS AND TAXIS ARE-USUALLY SCARCE AND/OR EXPENSIVE.------------------ RECOMMENDED CLOTHING------------------- RULES FOR THE EASY TRAVELER, THEN, ARE RATHER FORMIDABLE:-------- PACK LIGHT------- DRESS SHARP------- BE COMFORTABLE----------------- TYPICAL TOURIST CLOTHING------------------- THE CLOTHES WORN BY MOST AMERICAN TOURISTS ANNOUNCE THEM AS-AMERICANS BETTER THAN ANY TRILINGUAL POSTER EVER COULD. FROM THE-GROUND UP YOU'RE WEARING: JOGGER OR TENNIS SHOES, WORN LEVI'S,-COLLARED TEE SHIRT, AND SKI JACKET, WITH A BACKPACK. IF YOU ARE-PAST THE AGE OF BACKPACKS, YOUR OVERSIZED PLASTIC SUITCASE WILL-EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY YOU AS AN AMERICAN.------------------ GO LIKE A LOCAL------------------- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS YOU ARE BETTER OFF LOOKING LIKE A-LOCAL CITIZEN RATHER THAN A STANDARD AMERICAN TOURIST. DON'T- MISINTERPRET THIS. I LOVE THE USA AND ALL THAT IT- REPRESENTS, BUT I TRY TO AVOID BEING AN AMERICAN BILLBOARD WHEN I- TRAVEL OVERSEAS. THE PRIMARY REASON IS TO AVOID BEING A TARGET OF- PICKPOCKETS, A BREED ENDEMIC IN EUROPE. YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK THAT- IT COULD AVOID BEING CAUGHT UP IN TERRORIST BOMBINGS AS LONDON HAD- IN JULY------ THAT IS PROBABLY NOT AN ISSUE SINCE THE MURDERING- SONS OF BITCHES JUST KILL ANYBODY, INCLUDING FELLOW MUSLIMS PRAYING- AT THEIR LOCAL MOSQUE.--------- FOR MANY YEARS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WAS A PAIR-OF BLACK SLIP-ON SHOES, WOOL/POLYESTER BLEND SLACKS, TURTLENECK-SHIRT, AND SPORT COAT. THIS ENSEMBLE WILL GET YOU THROUGH ALMOST-ANY DOOR IN EUROPE WITH REASONABLE RESPECT, KEEP YOU COMFORTABLE-UNDER MOST WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND ALLOW YOU TO BLEND IN WITHOUT-BEING INSTANTLY IDENTIFIED AS "THE AMERICAN.----------" THE WOOL/POLYESTER BLEND SLACKS LOOK MORE LIKE WOOL THAN-PLASTIC, BUT THEY WASH DRIP DRY. YOU WON'T NEED TO IRON THESE-IF YOU CARE FOR THEM ACCORDING TO THE LABEL. LEVI STRAUSS HAS INTRODUCED- A NEW DOCKERS LINE AVAILABLE IN SEVERAL COLORS BESIDES THE NORMAL KHAKI.- A COUPLE OF PAIRS OF THE DARK CHARCOAL SERVED ME WELL THROUGHOUT EUROPE- ON MY JANUARY 2006 TRIP. TURTLENECK SHIRTS ARE-NOT COMMON IN AMERICA. IN FACT I COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE ONE IN DECEMBER------- THE MEN'S SHOPS ALL SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T IN STYLE THIS YEAR. BOOOSH! YOU CAN FIND THEM IN-SKI CLOTHING SHOPS. IF YOU ARE NOT IN SKI COUNTRY GET CATALOGS FROM LANDS END- AND FROM L.L BEAN FOR A GOOD SELECTION. I ENDED UP BUYING- A COUPLE OF GOOD COTTON T-NECKS AT THE V+D DEPARTMENT STORE AFTER I ARRIVED IN HOLLAND.- AN OPEN COLLAR DRESS SHIRT IS A GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TURTLENECK IN WARMER WEATHER.- IN VERY FEW RESTAURANTS IS A TIE REQUIRED, THOUGH YOU'LL SEE THEM- OFTEN IN BETTER ESTABLISHMENTS. FOR OFF-SEASON TRAVEL, I ALSO BRING A- LIGHTWEIGHT TURTLENECK SWEATER.- MY SPORT COAT HAS A HERRINGBONE PATTERN AND TRAVELS VERY WELL-WITHOUT SHOWING WRINKLES OR MINOR STAINS.----------------- LEVI'S------------------- LEVI'S AND OTHER BRANDS OF DENIM JEANS BECAME FASHIONABLE IN-EUROPE IN THE 1990'S. LEVI'S ARE NOW TOLERATED IN MANY CAF--------S-AND RESTAURANTS DURING THE DAY. HOWEVER, REGULAR SLACKS ARE MUCH-MORE COMMON AS STREET WEAR IN MAJOR CITIES THROUGHOUT EUROPE. BASED ON MY- OBSERVATIONS OF PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE CENTRAL TRAIN STATIONS OF EUROPE- LESS THAN 20% WERE WEARING DENIM JEANS. THE PREFERENCE- FOR THE VAST MAJORITY, MEN AND WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD, WAS BLACK SLACKS.---------- SLACKS ARE ALSO MUCH MORE IN HARMONY WITH PACKING LIGHT. LEVI'S ARE-HEAVY AND BULKY, AND TAKE A DAY TO DRY OUT WHEN THEY GET RAINED ON. IF YOU DO- WEAR DENIM, SELECT A LIGHTWEIGHT PAIR WITH A BIT OF FASHION. YOU MIGHT WANT- TO CONSIDER WEARING LEVI SLACKS RATHER THAN LEVI JEANS. LEVI STRAUSS- MAKES A GOOD LOOKING LINE CALLED "ACTION SLACKS." THESE ARE 100% DACRON- AND TRAVEL VERY WELL. WASH THEM OFF IN THE SHOWER AT NIGHT AND HANG THEM TO- DRIP DRY BY MORNING. I HAVE A COUPLE PAIRS IN BLACK. I RECENTLY SWITCHED TO ANOTHER- LEVI STRAUSS PRODUCT FOR MY EUROPEAN-TRAVELS AND EVERYDAY WEAR. THESE ARE- CHARCOAL DOCKERS, 55% COTTON AND- 45% MICROPOLYESTER, STYLE-NUMBER----------- THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE--AND LOOK LIKE DRESS SLACKS.---------- WHEN STROLLING IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE SUMMER A LIGHTWEIGHT PAIR OF-BLACK SLACKS -OR SKIRT PLUS A WHITE-TOP WILL SERVE YOU WELL. THIS- IS STANDARD ATTIRE FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIVE POPULATIONS, AND TOURISTS FROM- OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.---------- I HAVE NO AMBITION OF BEING A CLOTHING COP SO ACCEPT THIS CHAPTER AS YOU WILL.- THE ADVICE IS BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN EUROPE.- YEAH SURE, YOU CAN WEAR YOUR BACK YARD JEANS OR SHORTS, T-SHIRT OR NO SHIRT,- SNEAKERS OR FLIP FLOPS,- AND THAT IS THE WAY YOU WILL BE VIEWED AND TREATED IN THE COSMOPOLITAN- CITIES THROUGHOUT EUROPE. EXPECT NO RESPECT.---------- DRESSING WELL DOES NOT HAVE TO APPLY ONLY TO EUROPE. I HAD DRIFTED INTO WEARING- LEVIS-AT MY LOCAL PUB IN MICHIGAN A FEW YEARS AGO. ONE NIGHT LAST SUMMER I WAS- RETURNING HOME FROM AN EVENT WHERE I WAS WEARING A JACKET AND SLACKS AND DECIDED TO STOP IN AT- OSCAR'S, MY REGULAR PLACE, TO SHOOT SOME EIGHT BALL. IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE A YOUNG- LADY ABOUT HALF MY AGE STARTED BUMPING INTO ME AND MAKING STRONG EYE CONTACT. AFTER THAT- I STARTED WEARING SLACKS AND A DRESS SHIRT WHEN I WENT TO OSCAR'S. APPROACHMENTS-BY YOUNG DAMES HAS-HAPPENED- AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE POINT THAT IT HAS BECOME- EMBARRASSING, BUT I WON'T BRAG ON IT. GUYS, LISTEN UP HERE! DRESS SHARP AND YOU- WON'T NEED ALL THOSE BULL DROP LINES TO MEET A GIRL IN EUROPE, OR ANYWHERE.---------- I WOULD EXPECT-THAT A WOMAN DRESSED IN LEVI'S WOULD NORMALLY BE APPROACHED BY A MAN- IN MORE OR LESS-THE SAME LOW-LIFE OUTFIT. IT'S ONLY SPECULATION, BUT I GUESS THAT IF YOU- WANT TO MEET THE-PRINCE OF YOUR DREAMS IN EUROPE YOU WOULD DRESS TO THE NINES. WHY NOT? BESIDES,- WOMEN IN LEVI'S ARE ABOUT THE MOST ASEXUAL CREATURES ON THE EARTH. I DON'T KNOW WHY GIRLS WEAR LEVIS. THEY ARE SO UNFLATTERING TO THE DERRI--------RE.- AND IT WON'T COST YOU MUCH TO DRESS BETTER. IT WILL PROBABLY-COST YOU LESS THAN THAT NAME BRAND STUFF. THINK,- HAVE YOU BEEN TO YOUR LOCAL SECOND HAND STORE RECENTLY. THEY- HAVE SOME GREAT STUFF AT LAUGHINGLY RIDICULOUS LOW PRICES. YOU WILL WANT TO TELL YOUR- FRIENDS, AS I HAVE JUST DONE. MALE SPEAKING, I JUST BOUGHT A LONDON FOG BRAND, ZIPPER IN LINER,-TRENCH COAT FOR---- $IT LOOKS BETTER THAN THE THE ONE IN MY CLOSET THAT-I BOUGHT 1--YEARS AGO- FOR----- $WELL, I MUST ADMIT THAT IT IS A BIT OUT OF FASHION. MOST COATS IN EUROPE ARE BLACK-AND THE LENGTH IS JUST ABOVE THE KNEE, SO THIS THING IS THE WRONG COLOR AND A FOOT TOO LONG PER CURRENT STYLES.------------------ LAYERS------------------ DRESS IN "LAYERS." THIS MEANS DRESSING IN ITEMS THAT CAN BE ADDED TO OR-REMOVED INDIVIDUALLY WITHOUT CHANGING EVERYTHING WHEN THE WEATHER-CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, INSTEAD OF A HEAVY-OVERCOAT WEAR A SWEATER AND A-WINDBREAKER.- IF IT GETS TOO WARM IN THE AFTERNOON TAKE OFF THE SWEATER AND CARRY IT IN A SHOPPING BAG.-- DRESSING IN LAYERS REQUIRES THAT ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES BE COMPLEMENTARY-AND MIXABLE. DARK, NEUTRAL, AND EARTH COLORS TEND TO AVOID FASHION-CLASHES, AND DO NOT NEED CLEANING AS OFTEN AS LIGHTER COLORS.------------------ SHOES------------------- IN EUROPE YOU'LL NOTICE ALL SORTS OF FOOTWEAR---- -- BOOTS,-CLOGS, TENNIS, JOGGERS, SANDALS, ARMY ISSUE, AND ITALIAN FASHION.-MANY PEOPLE WILL SEE AND EXAMINE YOUR SHOES BEFORE THEIR EYES COME-UP TO-MEET YOURS, IF THEY EVER DO.---------- APPEARANCE IS IMPORTANT.-WEAR A GOOD LOOKING, DURABLE, BROKEN-IN PAIR OF SHOES. YOUR AVERAGE-AMERICAN DEPARTMENT STORE SHOES WILL PROBABLY BE MISTAKEN FOR-ITALIAN FASHION. PERFECT. AN AVERAGE PAIR OF POLISHED BLACK- SLIP-ONS WILL GET YOU IN THE DOOR ANYWHERE. ALSO, RUBBER SOLES WILL-SURVIVE FAR BETTER THAN LEATHER SOLES ON THE RAIN SOAKED SIDEWALKS-OF EUROPE.--------- INSTEAD OF SHOES, I HAVE BECOME A CONVERT TO SANDALS, MORE-SPECIFICALLY BIRKENSTOCKS, A GERMAN BRAND. ONCE YOU BREAK IN A PAIR-OF BIRKENSTOCKS YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK TO SHOES AGAIN, EXCEPT FOR-DURING STORMY WEATHER. YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO GO BAREFOOT AGAIN.- BIRKENSTOCKS HAVE A HALF INCH OF CORK BETWEEN THE HARD RUBBER BOTTOM AND THE- LEATHER PART YOU REST YOUR FEET IN. CORK IS VERY EASY TO WALK ON. YOU CAN- GO ALL DAY IN THESE THINGS. I- RECOMMEND BLACK SOCKS WITH THE BIRKENSTOCKS, UNLESS YOU ARE AT THE BEACH.- BIRKENSTOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE SO YOU CAN MAKE THIS ONE OF YOUR PURCHASES WHEN- IN GERMANY, AT PRICES 50% LESS THAN THE AMERICAN PRICES.---------- CARRY AN EXTRA PAIR OF SHOES SINCE IT IS LIKELY THAT YOUR-SHOES WILL GET SOAKED OCCASIONALLY. IF YOU INVEST IN A PAIR WITH-NATURAL LEATHER UPPERS, YOU CAN OIL THEM TO THE POINT THAT THEY-RESIST WATER LIKE WAX PAPER. USE MINK OIL OR EQUIVALENT ONCE A-WEEK.--------  AGAIN, DO NOT WEAR ANY KIND OF SPORTS SHOES, E.G. TENNIS,-JOGGING, OR WHATEVER ELSE THEY CALL THEM THESE DAYS. I WAS WITH-SOME BUSINESS ASSOCIATES IN THE HAGUE A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE-DECIDED TO TAKE A PUB CRAWL. TWO OF THEM HAD JUST BOUGHT NEW JOGGER-SHOES AND WORE THESE OUT FOR THE EVENING STROLL. SEVERAL PLACES-WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM IN-THE DOOR. THESE PLACES WERE JUST YOUR-AVERAGE DUTCH CAF--------- AND BARS,-NOT FANCY OR UP-SCALE. AND-MY ASSOCIATES WERE BUSINESSMEN IN THEIR 50S, CERTAINLY GOOD POTENTIAL-CUSTOMERS IN ANY ESTABLISHMENT. THOSE DOORMEN WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS SO THEY KEEP THE-OFF-SPEC PEOPLE OUTSIDE. NOTHING LOOKS CLUNKIER THAN FRESH-WHITE TENNIES. I'VE HEARD THAT THE FRENCH CALL THEM MARSHMELLOWS.- IN MY AMSTERDAM AND BRUSSELS TRAIN STATION OBSERVATIONS,- JOGGER SHOES WERE WORN BY LESS THAN 5% OF THOSE PASSING THROUGH, USUALLY- BY YOUNG PEOPLE WITH BACKPACKS.--------- AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TENNIES IS THE FLORSHEIM LINE- OF SHOES CALLED "COMFORTECH." THESE ARE LIGHT WEIGHT BLACK SLIP-ONS WITH A CUSHION- BOTTOM. THEY LOOK GREAT AT A DISTANCE AND WILL GET YOU PAST ANY MAITRE D'- OR DOORMAN.------------------ RAIN GEAR------------------- WEATHER PROTECTION IS ESSENTIAL. BRING A TELESCOPING-UMBRELLA. YOU CAN FIND UMBRELLAS WHICH SLIDE DOWN TO UNDER 10 INCHES.- A LIGHTWEIGHT HOODED MACKINTOSH IS-VERY-HANDY FOR THOSE FREQUENT ALL DAY-RAINS. A LIGHT PAIR OF LEATHER-GLOVES AND A HAT ARE-HELPFUL FOR-OFF-SEASON TRAVEL, AND CAN EVEN BE-USEFUL IN NORTHERN EUROPE IN THE SUMMER.----------------- WOMEN'S WEAR------------------- FRIENDS WHO HAVE READ THIS BOOK OFTEN SAY THAT IT IS OVERLY MALE ORIENTED. A MAJOR REASON,-PERHAPS, IS MY DISCUSSION OF CLOTHING, BUT THE ATTITUDE PROBABLY-SURFACES IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL. I'VE SEEN PACKING LISTS- ON THE INTERNET WRITTEN BY WOMEN WHO MUST HAVE HAD-A PLATOON ON HAND TO CARRY- THEIR UTTERLY ESSENTIAL STUFF. SOME GIRLS CLAIM THAT THEY SIMPLY CAN'T-TRAVEL WITH ONLY A CARRY-ON BAG, AND SOME BRING EVERYTHING-BUT THE KITCHEN SINK ON A WEEKEND SORTIE.------------------ HERE'S HOW------------------- I USED TO TRAVEL LIKE THAT BUT LEARNED THE HARD WAY HOW TO-DO IT THE EASY WAY. FOR A WEEKEND TRIP TO PARIS WITH MY DUTCH GIRL-FRIEND MANY YEARS AGO I PACKED TWO SUITCASES WITH SIX DAYS WORTH OF-EXTRA CLOTHES AND OTHER JUST-IN-CASE STUFF AND DROVE OVER TO PICK-HER UP.-I WAS AMAZED. SHE WORE A BLACK JUMPSUIT, COLORFUL SCARF, A- FASHIONABLE RAINCOAT, AND CARRIED A SLIGHTLY-OVERSIZED PURSE WITH EVERYTHING SHE NEEDED. ALTHOUGH-OUR ROOM WAS A- NICE ONE IN-AN ABOVE AVERAGE-HOTEL, THERE WAS HARDLY ENOUGH SPACE TO HANG MY THINGS-OR STASH THE-SUITCASES. MY PRECIOUS PARIS TIME WAS WASTED PUTTING THINGS AWAY,-DECIDING WHAT TO WEAR, AND REPACKING EVERYTHING.--------- WOMEN WRITERS CAN GIVE YOU-PLENTY OF TIPS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO PACK LIGHT. FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND ADVICE, LADIES-SHOULD CONSULT THE BOOKS OF MESDAMES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DENA KAYE,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GEORGIA HESSE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ LOUISE PURWIN ZOBEL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ,- AND-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ELEANOR ADAMS BAXEL------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ .- SOME OF THESE BOOKS ARE DECADES OLD BUT THE ADVICE IS TIMELESS.-ANOTHER GREAT SOURCE OF CLOTHING ADVICE FOR WOMEN IS ON LINE AT-------------------------------------------------------- JOURNEYWOMAN----.- THIS IS A COLLECTION OF-FIRST-HAND READER-SUBMITTED COMMENTS FOR- COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH A GENEROUS HELPING FOR EVERY- COUNTRY IN EUROPE.------------------ FRIENDLY HELPERS-------------------- PACK LIGHT GIRLS. YES, YOU CAN DO IT. YES, YOU MUST.--------- IN FACT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO PACK LIGHT THAN-FOR MEN. REMEMBER---- -- IF YOU PACK IT YOU CARRY IT, YOU BURRO-YOU. AND IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH AND SOME HELPFUL STRANGER OFFERS TO-GIVE YOU A HAND IN A TRAIN STATION OR TOURIST OFFICE, CHANCES ARE NINE OUT-OF TEN THAT HE IS HELPING HIMSELF. YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO-CARRY-WHEN HE IS-DONE WITH YOU.---------- YOU WONDER WHY A GUY WOULD STEAL A-WOMAN'S SUITCASE? HE PROBABLY HAS A GIRL FRIEND WHO WOULD BE-OVERJOYED WITH SOME AMERICAN CLOTHES AND TOILETRIES. IF YOUR-SUITCASE TAKES A WALK, I HOPE THAT YOU DIDN'T HIDE YOUR MONEY AND-PASSPORT IN IT; CASH, I.D., AND CLOTHES -------WHAT A SCORE! I WROTE- THIS PARAGRAPH DECADES AGO AND RECENTLY SAW THE FILM "FRENCH KISS" WITH- KEVIN KLINE AND MEG RYAN. IT IS A HOOT FOR FRANCOPHILES AND-GRAPHICALLY- ILLUSTRATES MY POINT. I GIVE KEVIN FIRST BILLING FOR HIS GREAT CHARACTERIZATION.---------- BY THE WAY, WHEN THE FRIENDLY HELPER IS DONE WITH YOUR-SUITCASE, YOU MIGHT LOOK TO SEE IF YOU STILL HAVE A PURSE. ONE OF-HIS BUDDIES STANDING NEARBY PROBABLY PICKED THAT OFF AS THE FIRST-CAVALIER DISTRACTED YOU WITH HIS CHARMING ACCENTED ENGLISH. THIS-SCENARIO SOUNDS A LITTLE HARSH, BUT THIS IS THE REAL WORLD, NOT THE-FANTASY FEELY-GOOD WORLD CREATED BY MOST TRAVEL WRITERS. SEE-CHAPTER 8 FOR ADVICE ON AVOIDING JESSE JAMES AND THE-BANDIT GANGS. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE, AND THEY RARELY WORK ALONE.------------------ BUSINESS WEAR------------------- CASUAL IS NOT COOL.------------ NO DOCKERS------------ AMERICANS TRAVELING TO EUROPE ON BUSINESS MUST WEAR THEIR-BEST. IMPRESSION IS CRITICAL IN DOING BUSINESS OVERSEAS. IF YOU-WEAR KHAKI DOCKERS TO-WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE SO-COMFORTABLE, PUT THEM ASIDE FOR YOUR TRIP. A DARK PLAIN-LIGHTWEIGHT- WOOL SUIT-WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR ALL-OCCASIONS. USE IT FOR AFTER WORK SOCIAL EVENTS-AS WELL.------------ THE TIE IS THE THING------------ WHITE SHIRTS ARE FINE AND ARE ALWAYS OK. YOU'LL SEE MANY MEN- WEARING COLORS. I PREFER A LIGHT BLUE. TIES FROM THE TOP FASHION NAMES,- OR KNOCK-OFFS, ARE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.------------ WOMEN ON BUSINESS------------ LADIES, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MADELINE ALBRIGHT SUITS AT-HOME. BETTER YET JUST-THROW-THEM IN THE TRASH. THOSE TIGHT PASTEL-SKIRTS AND JACKETS ARE SCREAMING YUK ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.---------- WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS PACK A NEUTRAL DARK PANTS-SUIT, A FEW OF YOUR BEST BLOUSES, AND A COUPLE OF SPLASHY SCARVES OR A STRING OF PEARLS. I- AM SO HAPPY THAT OUR PRESENT SECRETARY OF STATE, DR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE,- LOOKS RIGHT SHARP ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND PRESENTS AN IMAGE- THAT ALL AMERICANS CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF. SHE IS COOL, SO COOL. IMITATE HER- AND YOU WON'T GO WRONG.---------- BRING ONLY THE JEWELRY- THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO HAVE STOLEN.------------------ BEACH WEAR------------------- SPEEDOS ARE THE TRADIONAL BEACH WEAR FOR MEN IN EUROPE. YOUNGER FELLOWS HAVE TAKEN UP- WITH CALIFORNIA SURFER STYLE TRUNKS WHICH THEY WEAR OVER THE SPEEDOS.--WOMEN NORMALLY WEAR ONE PIECE AND TWO PIECE SUITS AS IN THE USA. HOWEVER A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF- WOMEN LEAVE THE TOP HALF OF THE BIKINI AT HOME. TOPLESS GIRLS ARE EVERYWHERE. AND THE- TONGA IS POPULAR, SHOWING 99% OF THE DERRI--------RE AND LEAVING NOT MUCH TO THE IMAGINATION.---------- TO LEAVE EVEN LESS TO THE IMAGINATION AND NOT WEAR ANYTHING GO TO ONE OF THE NUDE BEACHES.- GOING NAKED IS ALLOWED ON DESIGNATED COASTAL BEACHES AND INLAND WATERWAYS THROUGHOUT EUROPE.------------------ LAUNDRY------------------- UNFORTUNATELY YOU DO HAVE TO WASH YOUR CLOTHES WHILE-TRAVELING. THERE ARE SEVERAL-WAYS TO GET IT DONE. IN PACKING LIGHT YOU NEED ONLY 3 DAYS- WORTH OF EVERYTHING PLUS THE CLOTHES ON YOUR BACK. THIS MEANS A LAUNDRY JOB- TWICE A WEEK.------------------ HOTEL SERVICE-------------------- IN STANDARD TOURIST CLASS HOTELS YOU RARELY SEE A LAUNDRY-BAG, A NORMAL ITEM IN AMERICAN MOTELS. WHEN I HAVE FOUND THE-LAUNDRY BAG IN EUROPE I ALMOST USED IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE AFTER-READING THE PRICES. IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO BUY NEW CLOTHES AT-AMERICAN PRICES, BUT YOU WON'T FIND AMERICAN PRICES IN EUROPE. IF-THE HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A CLEANING OR LAUNDRY SERVICE, THE DESK-CLERK WILL BE ABLE TO DIRECT YOU TO A DRY CLEANER OR LAUNDROMAT.---------- IF YOU ARE ON AN EXTENDED BUSINESS TRIP YOU PROBABLY MUST-USE THE HOTEL SERVICE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT-YOURSELF. SOME MISERLY DILBERT MANAGERS WILL SINGLE OUT THIS ITEM-ON YOUR EXPENSE REPORT AND TRY TO DISALLOW IT. STAND YOUR GROUND.---------- WHEN HAVING DRY CLEANING DONE, MAKE SURE THAT CLEANING IS-DONE AND NOT JUST PRESSING. WRITE DOWN THE NATIVE WORD FOR-CLEANING. IF THERE ARE SPOTS OR STAINS, POINT THEM OUT TO THE-ATTENDANT. SPOT REMOVAL CAN'T BE GUARANTEED BECAUSE THE SPOT MAY BE-DUE TO LOSS OF DYE RATHER THAN MISDIRECTED SPAGHETTI SAUCE OR WINE.------------------ HOSTEL "SERVICE--------------------" IF YOU ARE USING HOSTELS AS YOU TRAVEL, FOR THE ECONOMY OR THE CAMARADERIE, YOU ARE LIKELY TO FIND-A WASHING MACHINE IN A SIDE ROOM. THIS WILL BE ONE-OF THE MOST-CONVENIENT AND CHEAPEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR-WASHING YOUR CLOTHES. IF YOU ARE TRAVELING IN HIGH SEASON YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE TO USE THE-MACHINE.-----------THESE FACILITIES WILL BE STRICTLY SELF-SERVICE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE-WORKINGS OF THE MACHINE, ASK. IF YOU PUT YOUR STUFF IN AND COME BACK SIX HOURS LATER YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE YOUR CLOTHES DUMPED ON ANY ADJACENT TABLE OR CHAIR. SOMEONE ELSE NEEDED TO WASH. DO LIKEWISE IF YOU NEED TO, BUT ASK-THE-MANAGER FIRST. JUST BECAUSE THE MACHINE HAS STOPPED DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE WASH IS FINISHED. IT MAY BE ON ONE OF ITS PAUSES.---------- BEFORE STARTING ASK WHAT THE FEE IS IF IT IS NOT POSTED. YOU MAY OR MAY NOT NEED TO FURNISH YOUR OWN SUDS.------------------  LAUNDROMATS-------------------- PUBLIC LAUNDROMATS ARE USUALLY ATTENDED, SOMETIMES ARE COIN-OPERATED, NORMALLY HAVE RESTRICTED HOURS, AND ARE TYPICALLY CLOSED ONE OR TWO DAYS A-WEEK. EUROPEAN-MACHINES ARE-SMALLER THAN AMERICAN ONES AND TAKE ONE HOUR-OR MORE PER LOAD. PART WAY THROUGH THE WASH CYCLE THE MACHINE-PAUSES FOR AN EXTENDED SOAK.---------- IF YOU ALLOW THE LAUNDROMAT TO DO-THE WASH FOR YOU THE ATTENDANT WILL SET THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDING-ON THE COLOR OF YOUR CLOTHES. ATTENDANTS FOLLOW THE RULES ON THE-MACHINE, PERIOD. YOUR PERMANENT PRESS WHITE SHIRTS WILL PROBABLY BE-BOILED AND RETURNED AS PERMANENTLY WRINKLED. I SUGGEST THAT YOU DO-IT YOURSELF IN A COIN MACHINE. IF YOU CAN'T READ THE DIRECTIONS,-ASK AROUND TO SEE IF SOMEONE SPEAKS ENGLISH. IF THAT FAILS, WATCH-THE OTHERS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN CELSIUS, A.K.A. CENTIGRADE. FOR-INFORMATION ON CELSIUS SEE------------------------------------------------------------ CHAPTER---- 27, "THE METRIC SYSTEM IN EUROPE.-----------" THE PRICE OF ONE LOAD OF WASH CAN BE THREE DOLLARS OR MORE.-DETERGENT WILL BE AVAILABLE, EITHER IN SINGLE LOAD SIZES FROM A-COIN AUTOMAT OR FREE FROM A SOAP TUB IN THE LAUNDROMAT.---------  DRYERS ARE SIMILAR TO OURS SO YOU SHOULD HAVE NO-DIFFICULTY. DRYERS NORMALLY RUN ON A TEN MINUTE CYCLE AND THE COST-IS REASONABLE.--------- LONELY PLANET IS THE ONLY GUIDE BOOK SERIES WHICH LOCATES-LAUNDROMATS IN THE MAJOR CITIES. USE THEIR MAPS AND LEGEND TO FIND-A PLACE TO WASH YOUR CLOTHES. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO ASK-YOUR HOTEL. THE MANAGER MAY DIRECT YOU TO ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES OR-SUB-CONTRACTORS. THAT IS NOT ALWAYS YOUR BEST DEAL.------------------  WASH BASIN OR BIDET------------------- IT'S THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO A-LAUNDROMAT THEN YOU MUST SCRUB, SOAK, RINSE,-WRING, AND-HANG TO DRY.---------  ALMOST EVERY HOTEL ROOM IN FRANCE IS POSTED, "DON'T WASH-YOUR CLOTHES IN THE ROOM, AND DON'T EAT IN THE ROOM----" -- FREE-TRANSLATION FROM-----LE FRAN--------AIS----- (FRENCH). MY THEORY IS-THAT IF NO DRIP MARKS OR CRUMBS ARE LEFT ON THE FLOOR, THE SPIRIT-OF THE HOTEL KEEPER'S REQUEST IS HONORED. HAND WASHING CLOTHES IN-YOUR ROOM WILL CERTAINLY SAVE YOU MONEY, WILL PROBABLY OCCUPY LESS OF-YOUR TIME, AND WILL RELIEVE YOU OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF DELAY DUE TO-SOMETIMES SERVICE. PICNICKING IN YOUR ROOM HAS EXACTLY THE SAME- BENEFITS. SEE CHAPTER 15, "EATING YOUR WAY THROUGH EUROPE.--------"  INSTEAD OF DOING YOUR LAUNDRY IN THE WASH BASIN, USE THE-BIDET. A LETTER FROM A READER OF AN EARLIER EDITION ASKED IF THIS-IS SANITARY. THE BIDET IS CLEAN SO WHY NOT? YOU CAN LET YOUR-LAUNDRY SOAK FOR A WHILE AND STILL BE ABLE TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH AND-WASH YOUR FACE.---------- WRING OUT YOUR-UNDERWEAR AND HANG IT OVER THE USUALLY PRESENT RADIATOR. IT WILL BE-WARM AND DRY BY MORNING. BUT DUST OFF THE RADIATOR FIRST. AND DO-THE WASH EARLY IN THE EVENING SINCE THE HEAT IS OFTEN TURNED OFF AT-NIGHT AND THEN COMES-BACK ON FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE MORNING.---------- ONE CHALLENGE TO THE SCRUB-IT-YOURSELFER WILL BE IN HANGING YOUR CLOTHES- IF THEY ARE STILL- DRIPPING. THIS APPLIES TO SLACKS, SKIRTS, SHIRTS, BLOUSES, AND OTHER- OUTER-WEAR. IF YOU HAVE-NO-BATHTUB OR-SHOWER IN THE ROOM, USE A-NEWSPAPER TO CATCH THE DRIPS. SOMETIMES A BIT OF INGENUITY WILL BE-NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO TIE YOUR LINE ON. SOME ROOMS ARE-ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. STRAPPING TAPE CAN SOMETIMES COME TO THE RESCUE.- SEE------------------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER---- 6, "A PACKING LIST FOR-EUROPE.-"TAKE YOUR WASH DOWN IN THE MORNING SO THAT THE CHAMBERMAID DOESN'T OBSERVE. YOU DON'T-NEED A CONFRONTATION WITH THE HOTEL KEEPER. IF YOUR CLOTHES ARE STILL DAMP JUST HANG-- THEM IN THE CLOSET, IF THERE IS ONE.------------------ BUYING EUROPEAN CLOTHES------------------  BUYING CLOTHES IN EUROPE CAN BE A CHALLENGE. CLOTHING IS-CUT DIFFERENTLY, PARTLY FOR STYLE AND PARTLY TO FIT THE BUILD OF-THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. THIS VARIES CONSIDERABLY FROM COUNTRY TO-COUNTRY.----------------- SIZE CONVERSION TABLES------------------  TAKE CARE IN USING THE CLOTHING SIZE CONVERSION TABLES-PRESENTED IN TRAVEL BOOKS. TABLES DIFFER. SALES CLERKS ARE SELDOM-KNOWLEDGEABLE OR HELPFUL ON THIS. THEY KNOW LESS ABOUT AMERICAN-SIZES THAN YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT EUROPEAN SIZES. SIZE TABLES ARE-POSTED IN SOME OF THE LARGE DEPARTMENT STORES, THOUGH IN SOME-STORES I HAVE SEEN CONFLICTING CONVERSION TABLES FOR AMERICAN TO-EUROPEAN SIZES ON THE WALL AND ON GARMENT PACKAGES. I HAVE BOUGHT-THE SAME SIZE UNDER SHORTS WITH THE SAME BRAND NAME IN TWO DIFFERENT-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. ONE WAS LOOSE AND ONE WAS-TIGHT.-----------  THE TRUE TEST------------ IF YOU BUY CLOTHES IN EUROPE, HAVE YOURSELF MEASURED BY A-COMPETENT SALESPERSON, IF YOU CAN FIND ONE. MEASUREMENTS AND SIZES WILL NORMALLY BE IN-CENTIMETERS. SEE------------------------------------------------------------ CHAPTER---- 27, "THE METRIC SYSTEM IN EUROPE" IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.-- MEN'S SHIRT SLEEVES ARE MEASURED-FROM THE SHOULDERS, NOT THE SPINE. ALSO TRY THE GARMENT ON.-ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL SHRINK WHEN WASHED. COTTON ITEMS-PURCHASED IN EUROPE WILL PROBABLY SHRINK. BUY SOMETHING A SIZE TOO BIG, MAYBE TWO SIZES OVER.----------------  HAIR------------------- ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US PACK FOR A-TRIP, HAIR IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR WARDROBE IN THE CONTEXT OF-YOUR APPEARANCE.----------------- MEN------------------  THE LONG GRIZZLY LOOK IS CHARACTERISTIC OF LABORERS AND-DOPEY STUDENTS, JUST AS IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES. BEFORE YOU GO,-GET A HAIRCUT. SHORT HAIR IS MUCH EASIER TO TAKE CARE OF, AN-IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHILE TRAVELING. BUT, DON'T GET A MILITARY-TRIM. THAT'S TOO SHORT.--------- THE MORNING SHAVE IS PROBABLY THE ONE THING MOST MEN WISH-THEY COULD DO WITHOUT, BUT IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO CONTINUE SHAVING.-BEARDS INVOKE SUSPICION IN MANY PEOPLE (E.G., CUSTOMS AGENTS AND-AIRPORT SECURITY FOLKS), FEAR IN SOME (E.G., YOUNG WOMEN), AND INSTANT-DISLIKE IN MOST OF THE REST (E.G., HOTEL CLERKS AND MAITRES D').-YOU DON'T NEED HASSLES AND REJECTIONS FROM THESE FOLKS WHILE YOU-ARE TRAVELING. BUT THEN AGAIN, WEARING A BEARD SAVES TIME AND TROUBLE- IN THE MORNING SO MAKE YOUR OWN CALL ON THIS. TRY TO KEEP IT NEATLY- TRIMMED IF YOU HAVE A BEARD. I HAVE HAD A BEARD FOR MANY YEARS, ON AND OFF.-I PUT UP WITH THE HASSLES FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF AVOIDING THE MORNING SCRAPE.- SEE------------------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER---- 6, "A PACKING LIST FOR EUROPE" TO LEARN A BETTER WAY TO SHAVE----- -- WITH VINEGAR.-------------------- WOMEN------------------- TRADITIONALLY, EUROPEAN WOMEN DO NOT SHAVE THEIR LEGS. BUT THEY-SELDOM SHOW MUCH LEG (EXCEPT AT THE BEACH) SINCE THEIR DRESSES AND SKIRTS- OVERLAP THEIR BOOTS. AN AMERICAN WOMAN TRAVELING IN EUROPE COULD-EASILY ESCAPE THE REGULAR LEG SHAVING. IN ADDITION, MANY EUROPEAN- WOMEN DO NOT SHAVE UNDER THEIR ARMS. THESE TRADITIONS ARE CRUMBLING AND- WOMEN GENERALLY SHAVE THESE DAYS. WHETHER OR NOT TO- GO TRADITIONAL IS A MATTER OF PERSONAL TASTE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
