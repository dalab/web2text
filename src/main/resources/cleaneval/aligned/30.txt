ONE AREA THAT IS OF PERENNIAL INTEREST IS HOW TO BEST CONFIGURE THE GRADES IN LOCAL SCHOOLS. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES FOR KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE 1--IN A VARIETY OF GRADE ARRANGEMENTS, FROM THE K-12 SCHOOL TO SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR SINGLE GRADES. UNFORTUNATELY, AS PAGLIN AND FAGER (1997) POINT OUT:-------RESEARCH HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFINITIVE ANSWERS TO THE MYRIAD POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ABOUT GRADE SPAN, BUT THE QUESTIONS HAVE NEVER GONE AWAY. THEY ARE QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE WHENEVER SCHOOL REFORM, INCREASING OR-DECLINING ENROLLMENT, OR FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS BRING ABOUT A REORGANIZATION OF EXISTING SCHOOLS, THE BUILDING OF NEW SCHOOLS, OR CONSOLIDATION OF DISTRICTS-----" (P. 2). MUCH OF THE RESEARCH AVAILABLE HAS BEEN DONE ON RURAL OR MIDDLE SCHOOLS. THE RESEARCH ON THE----- "BEST-----" GRADE CONFIGURATION IS INCONCLUSIVE. AT BEST, IT INDICATES FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING ON A SCHOOL'S GRADE SPAN OR A COMMUNITY'S CONFIGURATION OF-GRADES WITHIN ITS ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL SYSTEM.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTENTS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO SCHOOLS DIFFER IN GRADE CONFIGURATION?------------------------------------------------------- SINGLE-GRADE-LEVEL CONFIGURATIONS-------------------------------------------- OTHER GRADE-LEVEL CONFIGURATIONS: MIDDLE SCHOOLS, K---------------------------------------------12 HOW DO GRADE CONFIGURATIONS AFFECT TRANSITIONS?-------------------------------------------- WHAT FACTORS DO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING ON GRADE CONFIGURATION?------------------------------------------- REFERENCES--------------------------------------------- WEB RESOURCES---------------------------------------------- ERIC RESOURCES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW--------------- DO SCHOOLS DIFFER IN GRADE CONFIGURATION?-------------------- SCHOOLS IN--------------- THE UNITED STATES ARE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT WAYS: SOME SCHOOLS--------------- INCLUDE K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, OR K-12; OTHERS ARE ORGANIZED--------------- AS MIDDLE SCHOOLS, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS, AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS;--------------- AND STILL OTHERS CONSIST OF STUDENTS IN JUST ONE GRADE, SUCH AS----------------A KINDERGARTEN CENTER OR A NINTH-GRADE CENTER. SOME SCHOOLS INCLUDE--------------- PRE-KINDERGARTEN.

THE SEPARATION OF STUDENTS IN GRADES--------------- 5 OR 6 TO 7 OR 8 IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS IS JUSTIFIED BY SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS--------------- BECAUSE DISTRICTS BELIEVE THAT MIDDLE SCHOOLS BETTER MEET THE DEVELOPMENTAL--------------- NEEDS OF PREADOLESCENTS. AS HOWLEY (2002) POINTS OUT, THE DEVELOPMENTAL--------------- NEEDS OF YOUNG ADOLESCENTS DIFFER FROM THOSE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL--------------- CHILDREN AND OLDER TEENAGERS.----- "DEVELOPMENTALLY RESPONSIVE MIDDLE--------------- SCHOOLS MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THAT IS KNOWN ABOUT YOUNG ADOLESCENTS--------------- AND THE CULTURAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY LIVE-----" (LOUNSBURY, 1996).--------------- THE NUMBER OF MIDDLE SCHOOLS INCREASED BY 35% FROM 1967 TO---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THE PAST--------------- DECADE, RESEARCHERS ALSO HAVE DEMONSTRATED RENEWED INTEREST IN SCHOOLS--------------- THAT INCLUDE GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH---- A STUDY OF RURAL SCHOOLS--------------- THAT EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GRADE CONFIGURATION AND STUDENT--------------- ACHIEVEMENT IN LOUISIANA FOUND THAT STUDENTS IN K-12 RURAL SCHOOLS--------------- DID AS WELL OR BETTER ON ACHIEVEMENT TESTS AS STUDENTS IN SEPARATE--------------- ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, OR HIGH SCHOOLS.

THIS STUDY PRODUCED SIMILAR--------------- RESULTS (BICKEL, HOWLEY, WILLIAMS,---- & GLASCOCK, 2000).------------------------------------------- HOW--------------- DO GRADE CONFIGURATIONS AFFECT TRANSITIONS?------------------------ THE DIVISION--------------- OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS INTO CONFIGURATIONS THAT INCLUDE FEWER GRADES--------------- REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS MAKE SEVERAL TRANSITIONS FROM ONE SCHOOL--------------- TO ANOTHER. RESEARCHERS NOTE THAT TRANSITIONS CAN BE STRESSFUL FOR--------------- STUDENTS:--------------------------------------- ALSPAUGH----------------- (1999) FOUND A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT LOSS DURING EACH TRANSITION----------------- YEAR. HE ALSO FOUND THAT SOME STUDENTS REGAIN WHAT IS LOST IN----------------- THE FOLLOWING YEAR, BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT STUDENTS WHO MAKE FEWER----------------- TRANSITIONS NEED FEWER YEARS TO MAKE UP FOR ACHIEVEMENT LOSSES----------------- CAUSED BY TRANSITIONS.------------------------ ANOTHER----------------- STUDY FOUND THAT EACH TIME STUDENTS SWITCHED SCHOOLS, THEIR FEELINGS----------------- OF ANONYMITY INCREASED. RESEARCHERS WHO FOUND THAT SIXTH-GRADE----------------- STUDENTS IN BOTH ELEMENTARY AND COMBINATION K----SCHOOLS OUTPERFORMED------------------STUDENTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS CONSIDERED THE----------------- NUMBER OF TRANSITIONS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR. THIS STUDY CONSIDERED----------------- 8 SCHOOLS WITH 7 DIFFERENT GRADE SPANS WITH STUDENT POPULATIONS----------------- OF 82 TO 1,-----THE SCHOOLS WERE LOCATED IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL----------------- SETTINGS IN 5 NORTHWEST STATES. THE NUMBER OF GRADES IN THE SCHOOLS----------------- RANGED-FROM 1 TO 11 (PAGLIN-------FAGER, 1997).------------------------ ANOTHER----------------- RESEARCH STUDY FOUND THAT GIRLS IN EARLY ADOLESCENCE SUFFERED----------------- FROM A DROP IN SELF-ESTEEM, EXTRACURRICULAR PARTICIPATION, AND----------------- LEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION INTO-MIDDLE----------------- SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH, BUT-NOT IF THEY REMAINED IN AN ELEMENTARY----------------- SCHOOL SETTING. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS OF THIS TRANSITION----------------- LINGERED THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEARS. FOR BOYS, THE STUDY FOUND----------------- SIMILAR NEGATIVE EFFECTS IN EXTRACURRICULAR PARTICIPATION AND----------------- GRADES, BUT NOT IN SELF-ESTEEM, WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION----------------- INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDED THAT----------------- THE RELATIVELY PROTECTED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SETTING MADE THE ENTRY----------------- INTO ADOLESCENCE LESS STRESSFUL FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS. THE STUDENTS----------------- WHO HAD NOT HAD THE STRESS OF THE EARLIER TRANSITION SEEMED TO----------------- COPE BETTER WITH THE TRANSITION INTO HIGH SCHOOL THAN DID OTHER----------------- STUDENTS (SIMMONS---- & BLYTH, 1987).------------------------ FRANKLIN----------------- AND GLASCOCK (1996) FOUND THAT SIXTH-GRADE BOYS EXPERIENCED MORE----------------- SUSPENSIONS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS THAN IN ELEMENTARY----------------- SCHOOLS, POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF THE TRANSITION, THE----------------- SCHOOL ORGANIZATION, OR SCHOOL-SIZE.

LARGE CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS--------------- WITH NARROWLY SPECIALIZED GRADE SPANS ARE TYPICALLY OFFERED AS NECESSARY--------------- TO SAVE MONEY AND TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS. THIS--------------- PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THE SIZE-BY-SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS INTERACTION--------------- EFFECT PROVES ROBUST ACROSS ALTERNATIVE REGRESSION MODEL SPECIFICATIONS,--------------- AS IT DID ACROSS DIFFERENT STATES. IT ALSO EXPLORES WHETHER THE--------------- EQUITY GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER SCHOOLS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH--------------- THE NEED TO SAVE MONEY. ANALYSIS WITH FOUR DIFFERENT REGRESSION--------------- MODEL SPECIFICATIONS CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT INCREASED SCHOOL SIZE--------------- WAS RELATED TO INCREASES IN ACHIEVEMENT-TEST-SCORE COSTS ASSOCIATED--------------- WITH ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. SCHOOL SIZE WAS NEGATIVELY--------------- RELATED TO EXPENDITURE PER PUPIL, BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BECAME INCREASINGLY--------------- TENUOUS AS SIZE INCREASED, AND EVENTUALLY SAVINGS BECAME NEGLIGIBLE.--------------- IN ADDITION, ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS, ESPECIALLY AS MANIFEST IN THE--------------- DISTINCTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE SINGLE-UNIT SCHOOL, WERE RELATED TO--------------- COST REDUCTION. FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN BALANCING EXPENDITURE PER--------------- PUPIL WITH ACHIEVEMENT-BASED EQUITY, THE BEST GRADE-SPAN CONFIGURATION--------------- SEEMS TO BE A SMALL SINGLE-UNIT SCHOOL.

BECAUSE OF THE--------------- PAUCITY OF LITERATURE ON THIS CONCEPT, THE MAJOR PART OF THE REPORT--------------- FOCUSES ON THE REORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTH--------------- ALLEGHENY (PENNSYLVANIA) SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALTHOUGH THE K-2,--------------- 3-5 STRUCTURE IS OFTEN IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT,--------------- OTHER EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS CITED MAY INCLUDE BETTER CONCENTRATION--------------- ON THE EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN THE TWO--------------- AGE GROUPS, THOUGH ONE RESEARCH STUDY SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES--------------- IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, ATTITUDE TOWARD SCHOOL, EXTRACURRICULAR--------------- PARTICIPATION, OR CAREER ASPIRATION. THE GOALS OF THE SOUTH ALLEGHENY--------------- REORGANIZATION (IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT) WERE TO EQUALIZE--------------- CLASS SIZES TO FACILITATE MULTILEVEL INSTRUCTION IN READING AND--------------- MATH, AND TO MAKE BETTER USE OF STAFF, SCHOOL BUILDINGS, AND INSTRUCTIONAL--------------- RESOURCES. EACH OF THESE OBJECTIVES IS DESCRIBED IN-DETAIL, ALONG--------------- WITH PERCEIVED DISADVANTAGES. AN-EVALUATIVE REPORT REVEALED THAT--------------- THE NEW GRADE STRUCTURE SAVED MONEY AND RESULTED IN IMPROVED DISCIPLINE,--------------- STUDENT ATTITUDES, AND STUDENT INTERACTION. FINALLY, LITERATURE--------------- ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED, EMPHASIZING THE--------------- NEED FOR CLEAR ARTICULATION BETWEEN GRADE LEVELS.
