--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEETH FALLING-OUT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WE'RE GETTING LOTS OF DREAMS ABOUT TEETH FALLING OUT. WHAT'S THE STORY?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN MY DREAM I WAS-WITH A GUY-I HAD BEEN SEEING AND WE WERE SLEEPING IN AN APARTMENT (NOT HIS. I HEARD MY MOTHER CALLING FOR-ME AND SHE-HAD MY CHILDREN WITH HER. THEY CAME IN THROUGH THE-OPEN DOOR TO THE APARTMENT. I-GOT UP TO BE WITH THEM AND AS I STARTED TO TALK TO THEM MY TEETH STARTED FALLING OUT ON THE FLOOR AND I WAS HOLDING THEM IN MY HANDS AND PICKING THEM UP OFF THE FLOOR.-----------------------------------------------------------------  I AM SITTING DOWN ON MY SOFA AND REALIZE THAT MY TEETH ARE ALL WOBBLY... I PLAY WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE TURNED TO CHARCOAL.... I CAN THEN PULL THEM OUT REALLY EASILY AND THEY FALL INTO MY HANDS... I THEN WAKE-UP.-------------------------------------------------------------------------  I WAS-TALKING TO A FRIEND WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A FILLING FELL OUT OF MY MOUTH. NEXT THING YOU KNOW MY TEETH STARTED FALLING OUT ONE BY ONE FROM THE BACK OF MY MOUTH. I WOULD TOUCH A TOOTH ... IT WAS LOOSEN THE JUST COME OUT. WHEN FINALLY-MY FRONT TEETH WERE LOOSE AND ONE OF THEM FELL OUT AND THAT IS WHEN I WOKE UP. I WAS QUITE UPSET.----------  ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS, I DREAM THAT A COUPLE OF MY BOTTOM FRONT TEETH ARE BARELY HELD IN PLACE ... TWO OF THEM COME LOSE AND I CAN PULL THEM OUT. SOMETIMES, THERE'S BLOOD AND SOMETIMES THERE ISN'T. I SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT MY TEETH DURING THE DAY, AS THE THE ONES THAT DO COME LOSE (IN THE DREAM) ARE-A LITTLE CROCKED.------------I KEEP HAVING THIS DREAM ABOUT ALL MY TEETH FALLING-OUT. I WOULD JUST BE SITTING AROUND AND I COULD EASILY-PULL THEM OUT. THERE WAS NO BLOOD, BUT IT REALLY SCARED ME. AS SOON AS ALL THE TEETH WERE OUT THEN I WOULD WAKE UP.----------  IN EACH DREAM THE SITUATION AND PLACE IS DIFFERENT, BUT IN ALL MY DREAMS SOME HOW MY TEETH ALL FALL OUT WITHOUT ANY PAIN ... I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM, THEY JUST FALL OUT.----------  MY TEETH WEREN'T ACTUALLY PULLED, BUT I WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING THE SHOT TO NUMB THE AREA. IT WAS TO BE MY WISDOM TEETH THAT I NEEDED PULLING (WHICH BY THE WAY WERE PULLED ALREADY YEARS AGO) BUT A MALE (DIDN'T KNOW HIM) WAS GOING TO PULL THEM AND JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO, I SAID I WOULD GO TO THE DENTIST INSTEAD. HMMMM ... I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ANALYZE THIS ONE, BUT AM HAVING TROUBLE.----------  I HAD A DREAM THAT THERE WERE SPECIAL KINDS OF PACKAGES WERE REAL LIVE PETS COME IN IT AND YOU RAISE THEM, SO I ORDERED A CAT BUT I GOT A A RAT INSTEAD. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSE TO MEAN? I RAISED THE RAT AND THAT RAT WAS VERY HYPER, CAN YOU-PLEASE HELP ME? I ALSO GET DREAMS ABOUT MY TEETH FALLING OUT, WHAT-DOES THAT MEAN?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   INTERPRETATIONS----------------------------------------------------------------- I ONCE READ THAT TEETH FALLING OUT, OR COMING LOOSE, MEANT THAT YOU WERE ARE----- "COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING------ OR JUST BASICALLY----- "RUN DOWN-----" I HAVE HAD THESE TYPES OF DREAMS MANY TIMES, OFTEN VERY REALISTIC DREAMS IN WHICH I WOULD WAKE UP AND CHECK MY TEETH RIGHT AWAY.  --------I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT TEETH FALLING OUT IN A DREAM SUGGESTED THAT YOU ARE NOT IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE. YOU FEEL HELPLESS AND WITHOUT DIRECTION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF YOUR TEETH IN REAL LIFE, AND A VISIT TO THE DENTIST TO FIX THEM MAY BE IN ORDER.--------  FALLING TEETH MEANS YOU WANT FREEDOM FROM PARENTAL RESTRICTIONS.--------  LISTEN WITH YOUR HEART FOR THIS DREAM IS VERY IMPORTANT CONCERNING YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN.------------- YOU BEING IN AN APARTMENT WITH A MAN YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING AND THE APARTMENT IS NEITHER HIS NOR YOURS REPRESENTS THE MAN THAT YOU ARE SEEING IS NOT OUT OF LOVE BUT OUT OF SEXUAL DESIRE I.E. LUST. HERE IS THE-PROBLEM. IN THE RAISING OF YOUR CHILDREN YOU TEACH THEM WHAT IS RIGHT BY YOUR WORDS AND BY YOUR DISCIPLINE BUT BY YOUR ACTIONS IS HOW YOUR CHILDREN ARE LEARNING. THE MEANING OF YOUR TEETH FALLING OUT IS THIS-YOUR TEETH REPRESENT THE ROOT OF YOUR HEART AND IN YOUR HEART YOU WANT TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOUR CHILDREN BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE DIVIDED IN WHAT YOU TEACH BY WORDS AND WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR ACTIONS YOUR ROOT IS GOING TO BE WEAK. YOUR CHILDREN ARE THE ROOT OF YOUR HEART. TEACH THEM NOT ONLY BY YOUR WORDS BUT BY YOUR ACTIONS SO THAT YOUR TEETH (FOUNDATION OF THE ROOT TO YOUR HEART MIGHT BE STRONG INSTEAD OF WEAK OR TIGHT INSTEAD OF LOOSE. IN YOUR DREAM YOUR CHILDREN ARE THE ROOT OF YOUR TEETH WHICH LEADS TO YOUR HEART. IF THEY ARE LEARNING BY YOUR ACTIONS AND YOUR ACTIONS ARE WRONG THEN YOUR ROOT IS WEAK WHICH MEANS YOUR TEETH ARE WEAK OR UNSTABLE. YOUR HEART, ROOT, TEETH ALL REPRESENT THE MOTHERHOOD OF YOUR CHILDREN. TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WHAT IS RIGHT SO THEY DON'T GROW UP UNSTABLE THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS--------!!!  I ALWAYS THOUGHT DREAMS ABOUT TEETH FALLING OUT, MEANS SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE.--------  TEETH COME UP IN A LOT OF THE BOOKS I'VE READ AS ALL SORTS-OF THINGS.-MAYBE THE MOST FREQUENT IS RELATED TO SEXUAL DESIRE, OR LACK THERE OF. AND IT MAY FIT IN YOUR CASE, BEING THAT YOUR WITH-AN-X. BUT IN MY CASE, I USED TO HAVE THESE DREAMS A LOT WHEN I WAS YOUNG, IT HAD TO DO WITH MALNUTRITION, AND NOT TAKING CARE OF MY BODY. COULD BE A VITAMIN DEFICIENCY, MAYBE CALCIUM? JUST A FEW THOUGHTS. HOPE I HELPED.--------  I'D GUESS THAT YOUR FAMILY (OR AT LEAST YOUR MOTHER) HAS DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR CHOICE OF BOYFRIENDS AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU SUSPECT SHE IS RIGHT. YOUR FAMILY CATCHES YOU WITH HIM AT AN INTIMATE MOMENT, AND WHEN YOU GET UP TO JOIN THEM YOUR TEETH FALL OUT, MAKING YOU APPEAR UGLY TO YOUR MOTHER.------------------------------------------------------
