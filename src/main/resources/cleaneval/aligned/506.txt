THE IDEA OF THE MOVEMENT IS------- THAT OF EDUCATION IN COMMUNITY AND IN IT MANY PEOPLE HAVE FOUND A DEEP AND------- ABIDING INTEREST AND CONCERN. BECAUSE OF ITS VALUE AND INFECTION IT IS NOW------- SHARED BY A VERY MUCH WIDER PUBLIC THAN FORMERLY.--------------- THE ASSERTION OF TRUTH, THE UNVEILING OF ILLUSION, THE DISSIPATION OF------- HATE, THE ENLARGEMENT AND INSTRUCTION OF MEN-S HEARTS AND MINDS- ARE SOME------- OF THE INDISPENSABLE AND URGENT DUTIES AND SERVICES OF-OUR TIME AND ALL------- TRUE CITIZENS SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH THEM. FOR MANY, I FEEL SURE, THE------- EFFECTIVE MEDIUM FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THESE DUTIES AND THE FULFILMENT OF------- THESE SERVICES IS TO BE FOUND IN THE MOVEMENT WITH WHICH THIS PAMPHLET IS------- CONCERNED.-------------- ARNOLD S. ROWNTREE,---------- PRESIDENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS ASSOCIATION.----------- JANUARY------------------------------------------------------- COMMUNITY EDUCATION----------------- [PAGE---- 2] THE AGE IN WHICH WE LIVE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE------- GOLDEN AGE OF APPLIED SCIENCE, THE MILLENNIUM OF SOCIAL FACILITIES. THE------- DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY, THE-AMAZING PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC INVENTION, AND--------THE INCREASING DOMINANCE OF THE-MACHINE OVER LIFE, BOTH IN WORK AND-IN------- LEISURE, HAVE PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED THE MORAL, SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL------- ATTITUDE AND OUTLOOK OF-ALL, AND HAVE RESET THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN WORTH AND------- CONDUCT.-------------- UNIVERSAL ELEMENTARY EDUCATION, THE FLOODING OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THROUGH------- HITHERTO UNDREAMT OF CHANNELS, THE-DEMANDS UPON ATTENTION AND INTEREST------- THROUGH CINEMA, ADVERTISEMENT AND DAILY PRESS, AND THE FASCINATION OF------- SPEED AND THE DESIRE TO BE ON THE MOVE- , ARE-FACTORS WHICH HAVE GONE------- DEEPLY INTO OUR LIVES AND HAVE MADE IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE------- SERIOUS STOCK OF OUR SITUATION IF WE ARE TO PRESERVE THE UNITY OF OUR------- LIVES AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A PEOPLE, LET ALONE BREAK NEW GROUND IN THE------- EXPERIMENT OF LIVING.-------------- THE RESISTLESS SPIRIT OF MAN HAS DRIVEN HIM FORTH TO DISCOVER THE------- UTMOST LIMITS OF THE OBJECTIVE WORLD-TO SAIL ITS MIGHTY OCEANS, CLIMB ITS------- HIGHEST PEAKS, SOUND ITS DEPTHS AND MOUNT ITS HEAVENS, MASTER ITS STUBBORN------- RESISTANCE AND EXPLOIT ITS MATERIAL RESOURCES. THE QUEST HAS BEEN------- UNREMITTING, EAGER AND THRILLING, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN CONCERNED WITH WHAT------- MATTERS MOST, NAMELY, A TRUE HUMAN MOTIVE, A SUFFICIENT- END- FOR ALL ITS------- STUPENDOUS TASKS AND EFFORTS.-------------- INDEED, WHAT IS COMING TO BE SEEN WITH NO SMALL MEASURE OF ALARM IS------- THAT- MEANS- HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS- ENDS- , THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN THOUGHT------- OF AS SOMETHING WORTHY-IN THEMSELVES, AND THAT HUMAN BEINGS MAY BE------- SACRIFICED TO THEM; THAT UNLESS A WORTHY HUMAN PURPOSE OR USE CAN BE FOUND------- FOR THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES AND INVENTIONS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AGE MAY PROVE------- DELUSIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE OF MAN.-------------- WHILST MAN HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE REMOTE COUNTRIES------- OF THE WORLD HE HAS NEGLECTED TO PRESS FORWARD IN THE DISCOVERY OF THAT------- HIDDEN COUNTRY IN THE MIND AND SPIRIT. THERE-IS SO MUCH OF THIS--- TERRA------- INCOGNITA---- LYING UNDISCOVERED IN ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN, AND ITS------- UNVEILING IS SO IMPORTANT BOTH TO US AND TO SOCIETY AT LARGE, THAT THE------- PENETRATION OF IT AND BECOMING AT HOME IN IT IS ONE OF THE IMPERATIVE------- NECESSITIES OF OUR TIME.--------------- WHO- , SAYS FULLER,- HATH SAILED ABOUT THE WORLD OF HIS OWN HEART,------- SOUNDED EACH CREEK, SURVEYED EACH CORNER, BUT THAT THERE STILL REMAINS------- MUCH--- TERRA INCOGNITA---- IN HIMSELF?- IT IS THE DISCOVERY OF THIS TERRA------- INCOGNITA THAT IS CIVILIZATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS--- [PAGE----------- 3] OF EDUCATION TO BRING IT ABOUT, NOT ONLY IN THE EXCEPTIONAL PERSON BUT IN------- THE NINETY AND NINE, IN THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY AVERAGE MAN AND WOMAN.-------------- IT IS THIS SERVICE OF DISCOVERY OF THE- INWARD MAN- , THIS SEARCH FOR A------- TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF OURSELVES, THIS REACHING UP TO THE-FULL STATURE OF------- MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD, THIS BLENDING OF THE SPIRITUAL AND THE INTELLECTUAL------- IN A UNIFIED PERSONAL LIFE, THIS DEDICATION TO A WORTHY HUMAN IDEAL, THAT------- IS IMPLIED IN THE WORD-- EDUCATION-, AND THAT IS OUR IMPORTANT BUSINESS.--------IT CANNOT BE IMPARTED TO CHILDREN EVEN BY THE BEST OF TEACHERS; IT CANNOT------- BE GIVEN TO ADOLESCENTS; BUT IT CAN AND MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEN AND WOMEN------- IN FELLOWSHIP OF UNDERSTANDING AND CORPORATE DEDICATION TO THE SEARCH FOR--------TRUE KNOWLEDGE, IN A UNITED DETERMINATION TO SERVE THE NOBLEST CONCEPTION------- OF LIFE YET BEQUEATHED TO MAN.-------------- THIS-COMMUNITY EDUCATION IS THE PURPOSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS------- ASSOCIATION THROUGH ITS RESIDENTIAL COLLEGES AND EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS.----------------------------------------------- THE ASSOCIATION-------------- THE ASSOCIATION IS A VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION FOR ADULT-EDUCATION.

THE OLDEST-IS RUSKIN -------COLLEGE, OXFORD, FOUNDED. IN------ THE YOUNGEST IS NEWBATTLE ABBEY, NEAR------- EDINBURGH, FOUNDED A YEAR AGO.-------------- RUSKIN COLLEGE IS OPEN TO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN STUDENTS FOR EITHER ONE------- YEAR OR TWO YEARS. SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS MAY ENTER FOR DIPLOMA EXAMINATIONS------- IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, AND THE LECTURES AND LIBRARIES OF THE------- UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN GENEROUSLY PUT AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE STUDENTS. THE------- COLLEGE IS GOVERNED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS------- GENERAL COUNCIL, AND OF OTHER WORKING-CLASS ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH------- THREE UNIVERSITY- ADVISERS- . STUDENTS FOR THE MOST PART COME BY MEANS OF------- SCHOLARSHIPS OR GRANTS PROVIDED BY TRADE UNIONS, EDUCATIONAL TRUSTS, OR------- LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES.---------------------------------------------------------------------- AT BOURNVILLE, BIRMINGHAM, WAS MODELLED ON THE DANISH------- FOLK HIGH SCHOOL, AND HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF ACCESS TO THE LECTURES AND------- OTHER FACILITIES OF WOODBROOKE AND THE OTHER SELLY OAK COLLEGES. AVONCROFT------- COLLEGE, NEAR BROMSGROVE, IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS,------- AND COMBINES CULTURAL AND VOCATIONAL INTERESTS. HILLCROFT COLLEGE,------- SURBITON, IS THE ONLY WORKING WOMEN-S COLLEGE. COLEG HARLECH IS A WELSH------- FOUNDATION, THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY CONFINED TO WELSH STUDENTS. ALL THESE------- COLLEGES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR GRANT BY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION, AND ARE------- AFFILIATED TO THE EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS ASSOCIATION, IN WHICH THEY FORM------- A COLLEGES GROUP.-------------- THESE COLLEGES AIM AT PROVIDING SELECTED ADULT STUDENTS WITH THE------- OPPORTUNITY OF CONTINUOUS STUDY, UNHINDERED BY THE MANY OBSTACLES WHICH------- CONFRONT THE WORKER-STUDENT LIVING AT HOME---- [PAGE---- 6] SCANTY OR------- SCATTERED LEISURE, LACK OF PRIVACY AND QUIET, AND THE PRESSURE OF PRIVATE------- ENGAGEMENTS OR PUBLIC WORK.-------------- THEY PRESENT MANY ADVANTAGES WHICH THE TUTORIAL CLASSES OR THE W.E.A.------- COURSE IN A LOCALITY CANNOT GIVE-REGULAR WEEKLY PRIVATE TUITION,------- ASSOCIATION WITH SEVERAL TUTORS, A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS, EASY ACCESS TO------- BOOKS-AND GUIDANCE IN READING, AS WELL AS THE ENRICHMENT OF INTERCOURSE------- WITH FELLOW STUDENTS OF DIVERSE OCCUPATIONS, FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE--------COUNTRY, AND SOMETIMES FROM OVERSEAS.-------------- AND WHAT HAPPENS-TO STUDENTS AFTER THEY HAVE LEFT THE COLLEGES? IN------- EARLIER AND MORE PROSPEROUS TIMES THE MOST OF THEM WOULD RETURN TO THEIR------- OCCUPATIONS AND LOCALITIES, THERE PROBABLY TO ENGAGE IN EDUCATIONAL,------- SOCIAL, OR POLITICAL WORK AMONG THEIR FELLOWS. BUT TO-DAY THERE ARE MANY------- WHO SEEK FOR-NEW OPENINGS AND CALLINGS,, EITHER BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND------- WORK IN THEIR PREVIOUS OCCUPATIONS, OR BECAUSE THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO FIND------- MORE CONGENIAL WORK.-------------- AMONG THE STUDENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL HAVE ENTERED ON FULLTIME------- EDUCATIONAL WORK WITH THE W.E.A. OR THE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT, OTHERS HAVE------- BEEN ENGAGED AS RESEARCH OFFICERS IN THEIR TRADE UNIONS, OTHERS ELECTED TO------- PARLIAMENT, WHILE NOT A FEW HAVE QUALIFIED FOR SPECIAL FORMS OF SOCIAL------- SERVICE, SUCH AS PROBATION WORK, AND ONE OR TWO ARE PARSONS. RECENTLY, A------- NUMBER HAVE FOUND A USEFUL PLACE AS LEADERS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS------- AND COMMUNITY CENTRES THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE SPECIAL AREAS, OR ON NEW------- HOUSING ESTATES.-------------- BUT THE RESULTS OF RESIDENTIAL ADULT EDUCATION ARE NOT TO BE MEASURED------- IN TERMS OF EASILY RECORDED AFTER-CAREERS, OR ACHIEVEMENTS IN PUBLIC LIFE;------- THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULTS ARE THE IMPONDERABLE ONES THAT TAKE PLACE IN------- THE MIND AND SPIRIT-THE EXPANSION OF INTEREST, THE GROWTH OF CHARACTER AND------- INSIGHT, THE LOOSENING OF PREJUDICES AND STRENGTHENING OF PRINCIPLES.-------------- THE COLLECTION OF STUDENTS- SAYINGS IN LEARN AND LIVE BEARS WITNESS TO------- THE-FRUITS THAT MAY BE, THOUGH THEY-ARE NOT ALWAYS, GATHERED FROM-THE LIFE------- AT COLLEGE.--HE PUT MY HAND ON A NEW LATCH,- SAYS ONE STUDENT OF HIS------- TUTOR. AND ANOTHER SAYS QUITE SIMPLY:- HE INTRODUCED ME TO MYSELF.--------------- IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A BETTER PHRASE TO DESCRIBE ONE OF THE------- MOST IMPORTANT EFFECTS OF COLLEGE LIFE. FOR, AFTER-ALL, THERE-ARE MANY MEN------- AND WOMEN-WHO HAVE NEVER REALLY-BEEN INTRODUCED TO THEMSELVES, OR WHO ARE------- NOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH, OR AT-HOME WITH, THEMSELVES.-THE FIRST EFFECT OF------- SELF-ACQUAINTANCE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ENCOURAGING. WE DISCOVER OUR--------PREJUDICES AND OUR LIMITATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE OR CAPACITY. BUT THE------- RECOGNITION OF IGNORANCE IS, AS SOCRATES MAINTAINED, THE BEGINNING OF------- WISDOM; AND THE-EDUCATION WHICH SO BEGINS MAY PASS INTO THE HIGHEST FORM------- OF EDUCATION, WHICH IS THE- CONVERSATION WITH A MAN-S BEST SELF- . AND------- THIS KIND OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-COMMUNION IS BOUND UP WITH A--- [PAGE----------- 7] BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER MAN AND OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH------- WE LIVE, SO THAT THE STUDENT WHO HAS COME BY IT IS LIKE TO BE A BETTER------- PARENT, A BETTER COMPANION, AND A BETTER CITIZEN.-------------- WE DO NOT SEEK NOR EXPECT PERFECTION; WE SEE FREQUENT FAILURES AND------- FAILINGS BACK; BUT ALL OF US WHO ARE ENGAGED IN RESIDENTIAL ADULT------- EDUCATION ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE BY THE HAPPY KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND------- WOMEN WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN ENRICHED, IF NOT TRANSFORMED, BY THE GRADUAL------- PROCESS OF GROWTH IN KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM, HUMOUR AND GOOD HUMOUR-OF GROWTH,------- IN-FACT, IN GRACE.----------------------------------------------------- EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS-------- NON-RESIDENTIAL COLLEGES FOR ADULT EDUCATION-IN NORMAL AREAS-------------- ANY ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE A SETTLEMENT IN A NORMAL AREA------- MUST OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTY OF DEFINITION: WHAT IS A SETTLEMENT AND WHAT IS A NORMAL AREA? FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE A NORMAL------- AREA MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN URBAN AREA, NEITHER -SPECIAL- NOR- DISTRESSED- , WITH A FAIR PROVISION OF COMMUNITY SERVICES SUCH AS------- HEALTH, TECHNICAL AND POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION IN GENERAL.- WHAT A SETTLEMENT------- IS IN SUCH AN AREA WILL, I HOPE, BE CLEAR BY THE TIME THIS ARTICLE IS------- CONCLUDED.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT IS ALWAYS EASY TO SAY, FIRST, WHAT A THING IS NOT, AND THEREFORE IT------- MAY BE AS WELL TO SAY HOW A SETTLEMENT DIFFERS FROM BOTH A W.E.A. TUTORIAL------- CLASS AND A LOCAL AUTHORITY-S EVENING INSTITUTE. W.E.A. TUTORIAL CLASSES--------WILL BE FOUND IN SETTLEMENTS, AND SOME SETTLEMENTS ARE-AFFILIATED-TO------- EVENING INSTITUTES. MOREOVER, SOME INSTITUTES, ESPECIALLY THOSE PROVIDED------- BY THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, ARE THE EQUAL IN RANGE AND SOCIAL LIFE, AND------- MOTE THAN THE EQUAL IN EQUIPMENT, OF THE BEST OF SETTLEMENTS. WHERE IS THE------- DIFFERENCE?-------------- AS IS GENERALLY KNOWN, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE W.E.A. IS TO FORM A------- TUTORIAL OR OTHER CLASS WHERE THE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS REQUIRE IT, IN------- CHURCH HAIL, SCHOOL, SETTLEMENT OR WORKING MEN-S CLUB. BY CONTRAST THE------- SETTLEMENT HOUSES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES IN THE ONE BUILDING. ON THE------- OTHER SIDE, HOWEVER VIVID MAY BE THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A LONDON LITERARY------- INSTITUTE, ITS PROGRAMME, STAFFING AND GENERAL CONTROL ARE IN THE HANDS OF------- A STATUTORY AUTHORITY: THE PRINCIPAL, FOR EXAMPLE, CANNOT BE DISMISSED BY THE STUDENTS. IN A------- SETTLEMENT, HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT, WITH--- [PAGE----------- 8] HIS OR HER FELLOWS, TO HAVE A PREPONDERATING SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF------- THE SETTLEMENT, TO APPOINT THE STAFF, TO DECIDE THE EDUCATIONAL AND------- GENERAL POLICY AND GENERALLY, THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE, TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR------- THE DETAILED LIFE OF A COMMUNITY WHICH MAY INCLUDE AS MANY AS SIX OR SEVEN------- HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN.-------------- SO MUCH FOR DEFINITION BY CONTRAST. NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU FIND ON------- ENTERING A SETTLEMENT? INSIDE ON THE NOTICE BOARD THERE WOULD BE THE------- SCHEDULE OF THE DAY-S, OR MORE GENERALLY THE EVENING-S, ACTIVITIES. THESE------- MIGHT INCLUDE AN ECONOMICS CLASS, FOLK DANCING, A REHEARSAL FOR A SHAW------- PLAY, GERMAN LITERATURE AND PRACTICAL WIRELESS CONSTRUCTION.-THE NUMBER-OF ACTIVITIES IS NECESSARILY DETERMINED BY-THE------- SIZE AND ADEQUACY OF-THE PREMISES. FROM THE ENTRANCE HALL IT IS USUALLY------- NOT FAR TO THE COMMON ROOM. THIS SHOULD BE,-AND IN MOST SETTLEMENTS IS,------- TRULY-A COMMON ROOM. IT CEASES TO BE ONE-WHEN REHEARSALS OR COMMITTEE--------MEETINGS ARE ALLOWED TO ENCROACH. AFTER CLASSES ARE OVER THE EMBRYO------- PHILOSOPHERS AND FOLK DANCERS, ECONOMISTS AND GERMAN SCHOLARS, TOGETHER------- WITH OTHERS NOT BENT ON ANY SPECIAL ACTIVITY, MEET AND TALK THERE. A------- CANTEEN IS PROVIDED, AND TONGUES CAN WAG, GENTLY-LUBRICATED BY TEA, COFFEE------- OR LEMONADE, UNTIL 11 P.M., OR WHATEVER IS THE OFFICIAL CLOSING TIME. A------- LIBRARY IS HOUSED EITHER IN THE COMMON ROOM OR ELSEWHERE. FOR THE REST,------- THE ENQUIRER WILL FIND CLASS ROOMS, A LECTURE HALL AND WORKSHOPS, TOGETHER------- WITH, IN MANY SETTLEMENTS, THE-PRIVATE ROOMS OF THE RESIDENT WARDENS.-------------- MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN OF THINGS SO FAR. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PERSONS.------- HERE? WELL, IN THE FIRST CASE, THERE IS SPACE IN THE SETTLEMENT, COLOUR------- AND LIGHT, AND MANY-WHO COME THERE LACK THESE IN THEIR HOMES. THERE IS------- FREEDOM. IN THE SETTLEMENT THE INDIVIDUAL MAN OR WOMAN MAY BECOME------- SIGNIFICANT. THE MAN IS NO LONGER A LODGER, TOLERATED BY AN INHOSPITABLE------- LANDLADY. THE WOMAN IS NO LONGER- MERELY A WIFE-- DARE IT BE SAID?-SURROUNDED BY HOUSEWORK AND THE CARE OF CHILDREN. A GOOD MANY YOUNG------- PARENTS TAKE IT IN TURN TO COME TO THE SETTLEMENT, IN ORDER THAT NEITHER------- SHALL BE WHOLLY TIED.-------------- THERE IS NOT ONLY FREEDOM; THERE IS GRACE. YOU ONLY ACHIEVE------- SIGNIFICANCE BY MAKING YOURSELF ACCEPTABLE TO YOUR FELLOWS. ON FIRST------- JOINING THE SETTLEMENT YOU MAY DISCOVER PAIN, THE PAIN OF CONTRAST.------- SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT PLACES TO STAVE OFF REVOLUTION. BUT THE DISCONTENT------- STANDS A CHANCE OF BECOMING TRANSFORMED THROUGH RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION INTO------- POSITIVE SOCIAL EFFORT BY THE FELLOWSHIP OF VARIED SOULS, WHOSE EXPERIENCE MAY RANGE FROM THAT OF A COUNTY------- COURT JUDGE OR CITY ENGINEER TO-THAT OF A COACHBUILDER OR FACTORY HAND.------- THE INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE OF THE TUTORIAL CLASS IS ALLOWED TO IMPRESS------- THE PASSIVE PLAY-READER. FOLK DANCES KEEP THE EARNEST MARXIST HUMAN, AND------- CHRISTIAN AND ATHEIST ARE ABLE TO MEET-TOGETHER IN A COMMUNITY WHICH IS------- SALTED WITH HUMOUR.--- [PAGE----------------- 9] MOST OF THE WORK IS DONE IN THE EVENING, BUT THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE------- AND GROWING AMOUNT OF WORK BEING DONE IN THE DAY WITH SHIFT WORKERS,------- UNEMPLOYED, AND MARRIED WOMEN. IT IS NOT ONLY CLASSES-WHICH ARE ORGANIZED.--------IN MOST SETTLEMENTS THERE ARE-STRONG DRAMATIC GROUPS; ONE HAS TWICE BEEN------- IN THE FINALS OF THE BRITISH DRAMA LEAGUE FOR THE-WHOLE OF ENGLAND.------- SETTLEMENTS HAVE OFTEN TAKEN A LEADING PART IN FORMING YOUTH HOSTELS, IN------- FOCUSING PUBLIC OPINION ON THE SCHOOL-LEAVING AGE, NURSERY SCHOOLS AND------- OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT MATTERS.-------------- ALL EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS ARE AFFILIATED TO THE EDUCATIONAL------- SETTLEMENTS ASSOCIATION, WHICH IS A RESPONSIBLE BODY RECOGNIZED BY THE------- BOARD OF EDUCATION. CLASSES SUBMITTED THROUGH THE E.S.A. OR THE W.E.A. ARE------- INSPECTED BY THE BOARD-S INSPECTORATE. IN ADDITION, MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES------- GIVE BLOCK GRANTS TO SETTLEMENTS AND A CORRESPONDING-AMOUNT OF -------REGISTRATION AND INSPECTION FOLLOWS AGAIN.-------------- THE MAJORITY OF SETTLEMENTS RECEIVE A GRANT FROM THE E.S.A., RANGING------- FROM TEN TO THIRTY PER CENT, OF THE TOTAL-INCOME; THE BALANCE IS MADE UP------- OF STUDENTS- FEES (IN ONE SETTLEMENT THESE RANGE FROM IS. 6D. TO 7S.,------- ACCORDING TO THE CLASS, AND THE-YEAR-S ENTIRE PROGRAMME MAY BE TAKEN FOR A------- COMPOSITION FEE OF 12S. 6D.), GRANTS IN AID FROM THE BOARD OF EDUCATION------- AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY, LOCAL SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE SPECIAL EFFORTS,------- SUCH AS GARDEN PARTIES, OF THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES.-------------- THE STAFF WILL VARY FROM PLACE TO PLACE. THERE IS ALWAYS A FULL-TIME------- WARDEN OR JOINT WARDENS, WITH OCCASIONALLY A SUB-WARDEN. THE REMAINDER ARE------- PART-TIME TUTORS, TAKING THEIR SPECIAL SUBJECTS. THEY MAY BE WHOLLY------- OCCUPIED WITH SIMILAR WORK, AS ARE THE MAJORITY OF W.E.A. TUTORIAL CLASS------- TUTORS, OR THEY MAY BE ENGAGED ON QUITE OTHER WORK. THERE IS IN ONE------- SETTLEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, A POST OFFICE OFFICIAL WHO CONDUCTS AN ENGLISH------- LITERATURE CLASS WHICH HAS ACHIEVED RENOWN. MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE------- WHICH ARE NOT LIMITED BY STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE STAFFED AND------- ORGANIZED BY STUDENTS THEMSELVES.-------------- CARDINAL NEWMAN ONCE WROTE:- IF, THEN, A PRACTICAL END MUST BE ASSIGNED------- TO A UNIVERSITY COURSE, I SAY IT IS THAT OF TRAINING GOOD MEMBERS OF------- SOCIETY. ITS ART IS THE ART OF SOCIAL LIFE AND ITS END IS FITNESS FOR THE------- WORLD.- THE SETTLEMENT IS CONCERNED NOT ONLY WITH THE DECENT USE OF------- LEISURE BUT WITH THE VERY ART OF LIVING, AND THE WORDS OF NEWMAN MAY NOT------- UNJUSTLY BE ADOPTED-AS ITS AIM.--------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT I CLAIM IS LIBERAL EDUCATION: OPPORTUNITY, THAT IS, TO HAVE------- MY------- SHARE OF WHATEVER KNOWLEDGE THERE IS IN THE WORLD ACCORDING TO MY CAPACITY------- OR BENT OF MIND . . . AND ALSO TO HAVE MY SHARE OF SKILL OF BAND WHICH IS------- ABOUT IN THE WORLD, EITHER IN THE INDUSTRIAL HANDICRAFTS OR THE FINE------- ARTS.-------------------------------------------------------- WILLIAM MORRIS.------------------------------------------------------------------------ [PAGE----------------------------------------------- 10] IN SPECIAL AREAS------------------------------------------- THESETTLEMENTS WHICH HAVE GROWN UP IN THE MINING VALLEYS OF SOUTH WALES SINCE--927 ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE WHICH MAY FAIRLY BE DESCRIBED AS UNIQUE INASMUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE, IN A WAY HARDLY OPEN TO ANY OTHER TYPE------- OF ORGANISATION, THE PROVISION OF EXPERT ADVISORY SERVICES IN A VARIETY OF------- SOCIAL ACTIVITIES WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP------- AND CONCERN FOR PEOPLE IN WHOSE MIDST THEY ARE SITUATED, WHICH IS THE------- DISTINGUISHING MARK OF SETTLEMENT WORK.--REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR------- THE SPECIAL AREAS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30TH,---------------------------------------------------- A NUMBER OF PALLIATIVE AND PRACTICAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE------- SPECIAL AREAS IN THE HOPE OF MITIGATING THE SEVERITY AND DEMORALIZATION OF------- THE CONDITIONS WHICH POVERTY AND USELESSNESS HAVE IMPOSED UPON MANY------- THOUSANDS OF HOMES. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT------- OF EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS OF WHICH THERE ARE EIGHT IN SOUTH WALES, ONE ON------- THE NORTH-EAST COAST OF COUNTY DURHAM, AND ONE AT MARYPORT IN CUMBERLAND.-------------------- THE FIRST AND OBVIOUS NEEDS MET BY THESE EFFORTS WERE PHYSICAL. VISITS------- TO THE HOMES OF SOME OF THE MINERS REVEALED THE DESPERATE STRUGGLE GOING------- ON, NOT ONLY TO FEED THE FAMILY, BUT IN MANY CASES ALSO TO HIDE THE------- POVERTY THAT HAD OVERTAKEN THEM. STEPS WERE TAKEN TO MEET SUCH NEEDS AS------- FAR AS FUNDS WOULD ALLOW.-------------- BUT IF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION WAS SERIOUS THE MENTAL CONDITION WAS EVEN------- MORE SERIOUS, AND THERE WAS AS DEEP A NEED FOR AN UNDERSTANDING SYMPATHY------- AS FOR MATERIAL HELP.-------------- IN THE SITUATION WE ARE THINKING OF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN USED TO WORK,------- TO A CONSUMING OCCUPATION WHICH DEMANDED THEIR PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND------- OCCUPIED THEIR MINDS, BUT AFTER THE GENERAL STRIKE MANY THOUSANDS OF THEM------- FOUND THEMSELVES WITH NOTHING TO DO FROM MORNING TO NIGHT, WEEK IN, WEEK------- OUT, AND IN PLACE OF A REGULAR WAGE A MEAGRE ALLOWANCE FROM PUBLIC------- ASSISTANCE. NEXT, THEREFORE, TO TRYING TO MEET THE BAREST PHYSICAL NEEDS------- WAS THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY--- [PAGE---- 11] OF SOMETHING TO MEET THE MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL DEMANDS OF THEIR LIVES,------- AND IT WAS THIS WHICH LED TO THE FIRST SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH WALES.-------------- AS AN OUTCOME OF CONSULTATION WITH THOSE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE OF------- EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENTS IN NORMAL AREAS A HOUSE, MAES-YR-HAF, WAS TAKEN------- AND THE EXPERIMENT BEGAN OF EDUCATING PEOPLE TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THEIR------- OTHERWISE USELESS HOURS AND DAYS.-------------- AT MAES-YR-HAF IT WAS RECOGNIZED FROM THE OUTSET THAT SYMPATHY BECOMES------- MERE SENTIMENTALITY UNLESS IT HAS A PRACTICAL EXPRESSION, AND THAT THE------- SPIRITUAL LIFE OF A PEOPLE IS INSEPARABLY LINKED UP WITH EDUCATION IN THE------- BROADEST SENSE OF THAT WORD. THEREFORE AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO FIND WORK------- FOR IDLE HANDS TO DO AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE MIND. COBBLERS-------- SHOPS, EQUIPPED WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND LEATHER, WHERE UNEMPLOYED MEN------- COULD MEND BOOTS AND SHOES FOR THEIR DEPENDANTS AND ALSO FOR SCHOOL------- CHILDREN, WERE AMONG THE FIRST AND SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS. LATER CAME THE------- DEVELOPMENT OF MEN-S CLUBS IN WHICH MEALS WERE PROVIDED AND PIECES OF------- PUBLIC WORK UNDERTAKEN BY UNEMPLOYED MEN, BY ARRANGEMENT WITH THE LOCAL------- AUTHORITIES. THE CLUBS HAD WORKSHOPS AND TOOLS WHERE MEN COULD LEARN TO------- MAKE SIMPLE FURNITURE AND MEND THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLD NECESSITIES. SKILLED------- INSTRUCTORS WERE AVAILABLE, AND AT ONE TIME THERE WERE AS MANY AS FORTY--------SUCH CENTRES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SOUTH WALES-VALLEYS.-------------- THE STARTING OF ADULT SCHOOLS, AND INFORMAL CLASSES IN A VARIETY OF -------SUBJECTS, AND OF A LITTLE SCHOOL OF WEAVING FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS AT THE------- MAES-YR-HAF SETTLEMENT, OPENED THE WAY TO NEW FRIENDSHIPS AND WIDER------- CONTACTS. THE WEAVING SCHOOL WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND BROUGHT MANY WOMEN------- AND GIRLS INTO TOUCH WITH BEAUTIFUL WORK.-------------- ON THE SIDE OF EDUCATIONAL CLASS WORK THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDED COMPETENT------- LECTURERS IN SUBJECTS THAT WERE CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE-S INTERESTS.- ALTHOUGH------- ALL THE CLASSES HELD, AND THEY WERE MANY, WERE INFORMAL, THE STANDARD SET------- WAS A HIGH ONE. TIME HAS SHOWN THAT THIS PROVISION WAS IN DIRECT LINE WITH------- THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES AND LECTURES HAVE--------GROWN FROM 9 IN 1927 TO 78 CLASSES AND 420 SINGLE LECTURES IN 1937, AND------- THE STUDENTS FROM ABOUT 200 IN 1927 TO OVER 1,000 IN------ THE SETTLEMENT--------STAFF, WHICH BEGAN WITH TWO, TO-DAY CONSISTS OF TWENTY-FOUR, INCLUDING------- LECTURERS AND INSTRUCTORS IN ECONOMICS, BIOLOGY, MUSIC, PSYCHOLOGY,------- HANDICRAFTS, DRAMA, PLAY CENTRES, PHYSICAL TRAINING, AND RECREATION. --------------THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT WORKED LIKE LEAVEN, AND SOON ATTEMPTS WERE MADE------- TO ADAPT IT TO THE NEEDS OF OTHER AREAS. FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON ITS------- FOUND2TION WAS THE-OPENING OF A SETTLEMENT AT MERTHYR TYDFIL,-AND AN------- ORIGINAL PIECE OF WORK WAS BEGUN AT DOWLAIS. A LITTLE LATER OXFORD HOUSE,------- RISCA, WAS OPENED, AND WAS-FOLLOWED BY BARGOED EDUCATIONAL SETTLEMENT IN---------------- [PAGE---- 12] IN 1936 BY-ONE AT ABERDARE AND ANOTHER AT PONTYPOOL. PLANS-ARE IN HAND------- FOR A FURTHER ONE AT PONTYPRIDD, WHICH IT IS EXPECTED WILL BE IN FULL WORK------- DURING THIS WINTER. IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A NEW SETTLEMENT WAS OPENED IN------- SEAHAM HARBOUR IN 1930, AND THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IS ONE AT MARYPORT IN------- WEST CUMBERLAND, OPENED ON SEPTEMBER 22ND,-------------------- OF THE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH WALES SIR PERCY WATKINS, FORMERLY OF THE------- BOARD OF EDUCATION, SAYS:- EACH SETTLEMENT SERVES ITS OWN AREA, USUALLY A------- MINING VALLEY WITH A POPULATION VARYING FROM 50,000 TO-130,000, AND FROM------- THIS SIGNIFICANT FACT THERE HAS GROWN, PERFECTLY NATURALLY, A SOMEWHAT------- UNIQUE RESULT,-NAMELY THAT EACH SETTLEMENT IS NOT MERELY A CENTRAL MEETING------- PLACE FOR ITS ASSOCIATED CLUBS AND GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT IS ALSO A------- POWER-STATION FROM WHICH EMANATES GUIDANCE AND ADVICE.... A SOUTH WALES------- SETTLEMENT IS THEREFORE A NATURAL UNIT OF ORGANIZATION WITHIN ITS AREA FOR------- ANY FORM OF SOCIAL SERVICE WHICH DEPENDS FOR THE VALUE OF ITS CONTRIBUTION------- UPON A RECOGNITION OF THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF THAT AREA AS A------- WHOLE. . . . THESE FOCAL POINTS ARE INSTITUTIONS WHICH IN THE MIDST OF ALL------- OUR CHANGING SOCIAL PROBLEMS STAND FOR SOMETHING ABIDING AND PERMANENT AND------- STABLE....-------------------" AN ACCOUNT OF THIS KIND WOULD BE INCOMPLETE UNLESS SOME REFERENCE WERE------- MADE TO THE WIDER MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHICH HAS BEEN MADE------- POSSIBLE BY THE SPECIAL AREA FUND-AND THE INTEREST AND SYMPATHY OF THE------- SPECIAL COMMISSIONER, SIR P. MALCOLM STEWART, AND HIS SUCCESSOR, SIR------- GEORGE M. GILLETT. THIS FUND, ADMINISTERED MAINLY THROUGH THE NATIONAL------- COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE, HAS BEEN USED TO TRY TO MEET THE GREATER NEED------- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY-AND HAS BEEN APPLIED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND WITH------- VARYING DEGREES OF-SUCCESS. THERE IS NO QUESTION, HOWEVER, THAT THOSE WHO------- WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT FUND AVAILED THEMSELVES OF------- THE IDEAS THAT WERE BEING WORKED OUT AT MAES-YR-HAF AND IN OTHER------- SETTLEMENTS.-------------- ONE THING MUST NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND THAT IS THAT THE EDUCATIONAL------- SETTLEMENT IN SPECIAL AREAS DID NOT BEGIN WITH ANY ORTHODOX CONCEPTION OF--------WHAT A SETTLEMENT SHOULD BE, BUT ONLY WITH THE INTENSE DESIRE TO MEET A------- VERY SERIOUS AND DEMORALIZING HUMAN SITUATION, AND AN-OPEN MIND AS-TO HOW------- THAT COULD BE DONE.-THERE NOW SEEMS LITTLE
