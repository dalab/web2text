THE UNIT TOOK APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 6 WEEKS TO COVER. ALTHOUGH ALL AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM WERE INVOLVED, THE FOCUS WAS ON MATH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE CULMINATION OF THIS UNIT WAS A SPECIAL "PENGUIN PROGRAM".-PARENTS AND SPECIAL GUESTS WERE INVITED TO SEE A PRODUCTION, WHICH INVOLVED SONGS, POEMS, A READER-S THEATER AND A GEOGRAPHY PRESENTATION INVOLVING BEANIE BABIES. I THEN PRESENTED A POWER POINT PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED THE GUESTS TO SEE AN OUTLINE OF THE UNIT AND PICTURES OF THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AND EXPERIMENTS THAT THE STUDENTS HAD TAKEN PART IN.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   LEARNING EXPERIENCE------------------------------------------------------------------- #1  TITLE: "HOW DO PENGUINS MEASURE UP?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"  LEARNING CONTEXT:----------------------------------------------------  NYS STANDARDS:------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #2- INFORMATION SYSTEMS-----------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #3- MATHEMATICS-----------------------------------------------------  ELA STANDARD #1- LANGUAGE FOR INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING-----------------------------------------------------  SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARD #3- GEOGRAPHY-------------------------------------------------------------  OBJECTIVES:------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL RESEARCH A PARTICULAR PENGUIN SPECIES TO FIND OUT ITS AVERAGE HEIGHT AS WELL AS THREE OTHER FACTS ABOUT THAT PENGUIN.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL USE A VARIETY OF TOOLS-TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THEIR PENGUIN-ON PAPER AND THEN DRAW AND COLOR A PICTURE OF THAT PENGUIN SHOWING ITS CHARACTERISTICS.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL THEN USE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY-HAVE GATHERED TO CREATE A GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE HEIGHT OF THE PENGUIN SPECIES. THEY WILL ALSO ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON THAT GRAPH.-------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER FOR THE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED WITH THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE THEY MUST ENTER INTO IT WITH SOME PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. THE STUDENTS SHOULD SHOW SOME COMPETENCY WITH THE FOLLOWING SKILLS:------------------------------------------------------------  DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN A FACT AND AN OPINION-----------------------------------------------------  MEASURING, USING AN INCH OR CENTIMETER RULER, YARDSTICK OR TAPE MEASURE-----------------------------------------------------  INTERPRETING INFORMATION USING A BAR GRAPH OR PICTOGRAPH-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PROCEDURE:-------------------------------------------------------------------  MATCH STUDENTS UP WITH A PARTNER. ASSIGN A SPECIFIC SPECIES TO EACH PAIR, OR LET THEM DRAW A NAME OF THE SPECIES FROM A HAT.-----------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTE BOOKS OR PHOTOCOPIES TO EACH PAIR SO THAT-THEY CAN RESEARCH THEIR PENGUIN (SEE APPENDIX FOR REFERENCES).-IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER LAB, AND APPROPRIATE SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE, TRY RESEARCHING THE SPECIES THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY.-----------------------------------------------------  SUPPLY EACH PAIR WITH A LONG SHEET OF BUTCHER BLOCK, OR SIMILAR PAPER.-----------------------------------------------------  GIVE EACH PAIR OF STUDENTS A CHECKLIST (SEE ATTACHED), SO THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CRITERIA MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE PROJECT.-----------------------------------------------------  POLL THE STUDENTS-TO FIND OUT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR SPECIES. LIST THIS INFORMATION ON-CHART PAPER. THEN, SUPPLY-THE STUDENTS WITH GRAPH PAPER SO THAT THEY CAN TRANSFER THIS INFORMATION INTO GRAPH FORM. THE STUDENTS THEN CREATE QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED BY-USING THE GRAPH.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INSTRUCTIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS:-------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A HEARING IMPAIRED STUDENT-IN MY CLASS, I ALWAYS WEAR A PHONIC EAR DEVICE. THIS HELPS THE STUDENT FILTER OUT BACKGROUND NOISE AND CONCENTRATE MORE ON MY VOICE. WHEN THE STUDENTS BROKE UP INTO THEIR GROUPS I THEN ATTACHED THE PHONIC EAR DEVICE TO THE CHILD-S PARTNER SO THAT THEY COULD COMMUNICATE BETTER. FOR A VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENT OTHER MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THE WRITING PAPER THE STUDENTS USE TO RECORD THEIR FACTS MAY-NEED TO BE ENLARGED AND THE MIDDLE, DOTTED LINE CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW.---------------------------------------------  I ALSO FOUND THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ALTER THE PHYSICAL SETTING OF MY CLASSROOM. WE PUSHED BACK THE STUDENTS' DESKS TO MAKE A LARGE, OPEN FLOOR SPACE. THIS ALLOWED THE STUDENTS TO SPREAD OUT THEIR PAPERS AND MEASURE AND DRAW MORE COMFORTABLY. I ALSO ALLOWED A DIFFERENT GROUP TO WORK OUT IN THE HALL EACH DAY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TIME REQUIRED:-------------------------------------------------------------  PRIOR TO BEGINNING THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE, I SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR IN THE SCHOOL AND LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY COLLECTING APPROPRIATE CHILDREN-S BOOKS AND MAGAZINES ON PENGUINS. I ALLOTTED A 45-MINUTE PERIOD EACH DAY FOR ONE WEEK FOR THE CHILDREN TO COMPLETE AND REPORT ON THIS EXPERIENCE. I WAS ABLE TO ASSESS THE STUDENTS' WORK EACH DAY BY MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND KEEPING NOTES. I ALSO ASSESSED THEIR FINAL PROJECT WHEN THEY MADE THEIR PRESENTATIONS ON THE FIFTH DAY.---------------------------------------------------------------------  RESOURCES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------  VARIOUS REFERENCE BOOKS ON PENGUINS, CRAYONS OR MARKERS----------------------------------------------------  SOFTWARE FOR REFERENCING, WRITING PAPER, PENCILS---------------------------------------------  BUTCHER BLOCK PAPER---------------------------------------------  VARIOUS MEASURING TOOLS (INCH AND CENTIMETER RULERS, YARDSTICKS, OR MEASURING TAPES)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ASSESSMENT PLAN:-------------------------------------------------------------  AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EXPERIENCE THE STUDENTS WERE GIVEN A CHECKLIST (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED) TO USE AS A GUIDE. THE LIST HELPED THEM TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE STEPS THEY HAD TO COMPLETE TO HAVE AN ACCEPTABLE PROJECT. THE STUDENTS WERE ALSO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRITIQUE EACH OTHER-S WORK. AFTER EACH GROUP PRESENTED THEIR FINAL PROJECT THE OTHER STUDENTS DESCRIBED WHAT THEY LIKED BEST ABOUT THE PROJECT AND/OR MADE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THE PROJECT "EVEN BETTER". SOME GROUPS OPTED TO PUT THESE SUGGESTIONS TO USE WHILE OTHERS DID NOT.---------------------------------------------  WHILE THE STUDENTS WORKED IN THEIR GROUPS EACH DAY, I WENT AROUND AND MADE OBSERVATIONS AND KEPT NOTES ON HOW THE STUDENTS INTERACTED WITH ONE ANOTHER. I ALSO MADE ASSESSMENTS WHEN THE GROUPS MADE THEIR FINAL PRESENTATIONS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  STUDENT WORK: (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  REFLECTION:----------------------------------------------------  I CHOSE TO DEVELOP THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT INTEGRATED MANY CURRICULUM AREAS AND PROVIDED THE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER, COOPERATIVELY, IN SMALL GROUPS. THE STUDENTS REALLY ENJOYED THIS EXPERIENCE AND LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING ON IT EVERYDAY. I FOUND THE USE OF A CHECKLIST TO BE BENEFICIAL AND WILL INCORPORATE IT INTO MORE LESSONS IN THE FUTURE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   LEARNING EXPERIENCE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #2  TITLE: "HOW COLD IS IT?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  LEARNING CONTEXT:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NYS STANDARDS:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #2- INFORMATION SYSTEMS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #3- MATHEMATICS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #4- SCIENCE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #6- INTERCONNECTEDNESS: COMMON THEMES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OBJECTIVES:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL USE THE INTERNET TO LOOK UP VARIOUS WEATHER SITES AND CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THROUGH A WEB SITE USING LINKS TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL LEARN HOW TO BOOKMARK AND RETRIEVE A PARTICULAR SITE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL LOCATE AND RECORD THE TEMPERATURE OF A GIVEN AREA AND THEN COMPARE THAT TEMPERATURE WITH THE TEMPERATURE OF ANOTHER AREA TO DETERMINE WHICH IS WARMER OR COLDER.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL COLOR A THERMOMETER TO MATCH THE RECORDED TEMPERATURE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER FOR THE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED IN THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE THEY MUST HAVE SOME PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. THEY MUST SHOW SOME COMPETENCY WITH THE FOLLOWING SKILLS:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TELLING TEMPERATURE TO THE NEAREST DEGREE (CELSIUS OR FAHRENHEIT)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UNDERSTANDING OF NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE READINGS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  LOCATING DIFFERENT REGIONS ON A MAP AND UNDERSTANDING-THAT THESE-REGIONS HAVE DIFFERENT CLIMATES----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PROCEDURE:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PRESENT THE CLASS WITH A WHOLE-GROUP LESSON ON HOW TO USE THE INTERNET TO LOCATE A SPECIFIC WEB SITE AND THEN DETERMINE IF IT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. GUIDE THE CLASS THROUGH THE PROCESS-OF BOOKMARKING THE SITE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PAIR UP THE STUDENTS. WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY ARISES (WE DID THIS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING) ALLOW THE PARTNERS TO ACCESS THE WEB SITE AND RECORD THE TEMPERATURE FOR THEIR TOWN, AS WELL AS THE TEMPERATURE IN AN AREA OF ANTARCTICA (WE USED VOSTOK). THE INFORMATION CAN BE RECORDED ON THE ATTACHED SHEET.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS MUST THEN COMPARE THE TWO RECORDED TEMPERATURES AND DETERMINE WHICH AREA IS EXPERIENCING COLDER WEATHER. THIS IS ALSO RECORDED ON THE DATA SHEET.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, THE STUDENTS WILL COLOR IN A THERMOMETER TO VISUALLY DISPLAY THE TEMPERATURE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INSTRUCTIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER TO DO A WHOLE GROUP LESSON ON USING THE INTERNET, I TOOK MY CLASS TO THE COMPUTER LAB SO THAT EACH STUDENT COULD HAVE A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF HIM/HER. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THROUGH A COMPUTER IN THE CLASSROOM, THEN THAT COMPUTER COULD BE USED ALONG WITH A LCD OR VIDEO PROJECTOR.--------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE HEARING IMPAIRED STUDENT IN MY CLASS HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS LESSON SINCE USE OF THE COMPUTER HEADPHONES WAS NOT REQUIRED. FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS, THE TEACHER MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE USE OF TRANSPARENT, COLORED, HIGHLIGHTER TAPE. THIS TAPE CAN BE PLACED DIRECTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN TO HIGHLIGHT THE INFORMATION THE STUDENTS ARE LOCATING.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TIME REQUIRED:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE WAS IMPLEMENTED WITH THE HELP OF A STUDENT TEACHER WHO WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE COMPUTER LITERATE THAN I WAS AT THE TIME. SHE SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR LOCATING------- WEATHER WEB SITES AND SCANNING THROUGH THEM TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD PROVIDE US WITH THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION. SHE THEN SPENT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR TEACHING ME HOW TO GET INTO THE WEB SITES AND HOW TO BOOKMARK THEM.--------------------------------------------------------------------------  THIS EXPERIENCE TOOK ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO FINISH. EACH MORNING MY STUDENT TEACHER TOOK TWO CHILDREN TO THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR TO ACCESS THE WEB SITES, AND RECORD THE INFORMATION. THEY THEN RETURNED TO OUR ROOM TO MAKE COMPARISONS, COLOR IN THE THERMOMETERS, AND DISCUSS WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED. IN ALL, IT REQUIRED ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES. I LED THE REST OF THE CLASS THROUGH THE MORNING OPENING EXERCISES AT THE SAME TIME. AFTER EACH CHILD HAD A TURN WORKING ON THE COMPUTER AND RECORDING DATA, WE DISCUSSED OUR FINDINGS IN A WHOLE GROUP LESSON. WE SPENT A 45- MINUTE PERIOD POSTING THE INFORMATION ON A BULLETIN BOARD AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS BASED ON OUR DATA.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RESOURCES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A COMPUTER WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION AND A PRINTER--------------------------------------------------------------------------  DATA RECORDING SHEET (SEE ATTACHED)--------------------------------------------------------------------------  TEMPERATURE RECORDING SHEET (SEE ATTACHED)--------------------------------------------------------------------------  RED CRAYON OR MARKER--------------------------------------------------------------------------  PENCILS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ASSESSMENT PLAN:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE TEACHERS MADE OBSERVATIONS EACH DAY WHEN WORKING WITH A PAIR OF STUDENTS ON THE COMPUTER. A RUBRIC (SEE ATTACHED) WAS THEN USED TO DETERMINE THE STUDENTS' LEVEL OF COMPETENCY. THE STUDENT-S MATH SKILLS WERE ASSESSED BY THE SUCCESS THEY HAD WITH THE TEMPERATURE RECORDING SHEETS THEY FILLED IN. THE TWO RECORDING SHEETS SHOULD BE COMPARED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION COINCIDES. SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS ALSO ENABLE THE TEACHER TO ASSESS THE STUDENT-S ABILITY TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY-HAD DISCOVERED.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  STUDENT WORK: PLEASE SEE ATTACHED.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  REFLECTION:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE STUDENT-S PERFORMANCES DURING THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE, I MUST ADMIT I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT AT THE BEGINNING DUE TO A-LACK OF "COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE" ON MY PART. I WAS FORCED TO LEARN SOME NEW SKILLS FOR WHICH I AM NOW VERY GRATEFUL.--------------------------------------------------------------------------  I DON-T THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE UNLESS YOU HAVE ANOTHER ADULT IN THE ROOM, WHETHER IT-S A TEACHER-S AIDE, STUDENT TEACHER OR A PARENT VOLUNTEER. I THINK IT-S VERY IMPORTANT TO WORK IN SMALL GROUPS AND YOU MUST HAVE SOMEONE BY THE COMPUTER AT ALL TIMES TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS ARE ACCESSING THE INFORMATION CORRECTLY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   LEARNING EXPERIENCE------------------------------------------------------------------- #3  TITLE: "SOLVING PENGUIN PROBLEMS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"  LEARNING CONTEXT:----------------------------------------------------  NYS STANDARD:------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #3- MATHEMATICS-----------------------------------------------------  ELA STANDARD #1- LANGUAGE FOR INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING-----------------------------------------------------  ELA STANDARD #3 - LANGUAGE FOR CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION-------------------------------------------------------------  OBJECTIVES:------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL SOLVE MATH WORD PROBLEMS BY USING A STORYBOARD AND "GOLDFISH" MANIPULATIVES.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL CREATE AND SOLVE THEIR OWN WORD PROBLEMS AS WELL AS DESIGN THEIR OWN STORYBOARD THAT REFLECTS THE PROBLEM.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL PRACTICE KEYBOARDING BY TYPING THEIR WORD PROBLEMS ON THE COMPUTER.-------------------------------------------------------------- UPON BEGINNING THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE, IT IS HELPFUL, BUT NOT NECESSARY, FOR THE STUDENTS TO KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY HANDLE MANIPULATIVES. RULES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND "FREE PLAY" TIME SHOULD BE GIVEN SO THAT THE STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE THE MANIPULATIVES BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED TO-USE THEM AS A PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY.----------------------------------------------------------------------  PROCEDURE:------------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTE STORYBOARDS (SEE ATTACHED) SO THE STUDENTS CAN COLOR AND PERSONALIZE THEM.-----------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTE A BAG OF PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH TO EACH STUDENT AND ALLOW TIME TO EXPLORE AND PLAY.-----------------------------------------------------  USE THE OVERHEAD PROJECTOR TO DISPLAY A COPY OF THE STORYBOARD ON A LARGE SCREEN. PRESENT THE STUDENTS WITH A WORD PROBLEM THAT THEY CAN SOLVE BY USING THE GOLDFISH AS MANIPULATIVES.-----------------------------------------------------  MODEL THE PROCESS ON THE OVERHEAD.-----------------------------------------------------  AS THE STUDENTS GET MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY OF THE WORD PROBLEMS-----------------------------------------------------  AFTER DISCUSSING THE STRATEGIES USED FOR PROBLEM SOLVING, PASS OUT WRITING PAPER AND CHALLENGE THE STUDENTS TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN WORD PROBLEMS. YOU MAY WISH TO POST THE PROBLEMS YOU SOLVED TOGETHER AS MODELS FOR THE STUDENTS TO REFER TO. DEPENDING-ON THEIR ABILITY LEVEL, SOME STUDENTS MAY COPY THE PROBLEM AND ONLY CHANGE THE NUMBERS; OTHERS WILL CREATE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.-----------------------------------------------------  CONFERENCE WITH THE STUDENTS AND EDIT THE-PROBLEMS AS NEEDED. THEN, ALLOW THE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TYPE THEIR WORD PROBLEM ON THE COMPUTER AND PRINT IT.-----------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, DISTRIBUTE A VARIETY OF CONSTRUCTION PAPER, SCISSORS AND GLUE AND HAVE THE STUDENTS DESIGN THEIR OWN STORYBOARD THAT ILLUSTRATES THE WORD PROBLEM THAT THEY CREATED.-----------------------------------------------------  WHEN ALL THE STORYBOARDS AND WORD PROBLEMS-ARE COMPLETE, POST THEM IN THE HALL OR ON A BULLETIN BOARD. GIVE THE-STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A CLASSMATE-S PROBLEM AND SOLVE IT IN THEIR MATH JOURNALS. THE STUDENTS SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE A JOURNAL ENTRY DESCRIBING WHY THEY CHOSE THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INSTRUCTIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS:-------------------------------------------------------------  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME TO USE A PHONIC EAR DEVICE SO THAT A HEARING IMPAIRED STUDENT COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE.---------------------------------------------  ONCE THE STUDENTS-BEGAN WORK-ON THEIR OWN-PROJECTS, I SEPARATED THEM INTO GROUPS ACCORDING TO-THEIR MATH SKILLS AND THEIR ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TIME REQUIRED:-------------------------------------------------------------  THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE TOOK SEVERAL DAYS TO IMPLEMENT. I USED TWO 45-MINUTE PERIODS TO INTRODUCE AND PRACTICE PROBLEM SOLVING THROUGH THE USE OF MANIPULATIVES AND STORYBOARDS. ONCE THE STUDENTS WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS SKILL WE SPENT THE NEXT 4 DAYS (45-MINUTES TO AN HOUR) WRITING PROBLEMS, CREATING STORYBOARDS AND PRINTING THE PROBLEMS ON THE COMPUTER. SINCE THE ASSESSMENT WAS ON-GOING, I DID NOT HAVE-TO ALLOT EXTRA TIME FOR REVIEWING-STUDENT WORK.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  RESOURCES:-------------------------------------------------------------  PENGUIN STORYBOARDS FOR EACH STUDENT---------------------------------------------  OVERHEARD COPY OF THE STORYBOARD---------------------------------------------  ONE BAG (ABOUT 20) OF PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH PER STUDENT---------------------------------------------  WRITING PAPER---------------------------------------------  PENCILS---------------------------------------------  CRAYONS-OR MARKERS-----------------------------------------------SCISSORS---------------------------------------------  GLUE---------------------------------------------  CONSTRUCTION PAPER-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ASSESSMENT PLAN:-------------------------------------------------------------  FOR THE MOST PART, ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE DURING WHOLE GROUP AND SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION. THE STUDENTS' DEMONSTRATED THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH AS THEY-BEGAN TO CREATE THEIR OWN-WORD PROBLEMS.-OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AND NOTES WERE TAKEN DURING CONFERENCING TIMES IN WHICH THE STUDENTS EXPLAINED WHAT PROBLEM THEY CREATED AND HOW-THEY GOT THE ANSWER. SOME STUDENTS NEEDED MORE COACHING THEN OTHERS, BUT EVERYONE-HAD AN ACCEPTABLE STORYBOARD BY THE END OF THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  STUDENT WORK: PLEASE SEE ATTACHED.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  REFLECTION:------------------------------------------------------------------  ALTHOUGH WE ALL ENJOYED THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE, I THINK THE STUDENTS, IN-PARTICULAR, FOUND IT REWARDING. THEIR PRIDE WAS VERY EVIDENT WHEN ALL THEIR-WORK WAS DISPLAYED IN-THE HALL. THEY WERE EXTREMELY EXCITED TO FIND THAT OLDER STUDENTS WERE LOOKING AT THEIR WORK AND TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. I HAD TRIED A SIMILAR LESSON EARLIER IN THE YEAR BUT FOUND THAT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO DIFFICULT FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY STUDENTS.-I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THEY HAD PROGRESSED A-GREAT DEAL-WITH THEIR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   LEARNING EXPERIENCE------------------------------------------------------------------- #4  TITLE: "ANTARCTIC ADAPTABLE ANIMALS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"  LEARNING CONTEXT:----------------------------------------------------  NYS STANDARDS:------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #4- SCIENCE-----------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #5- TECHNOLOGY-----------------------------------------------------  ELA STANDARD #1- LANGUAGE FOR INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING-----------------------------------------------------  ELA STANDARD #4- LANGUAGE FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION-------------------------------------------------------------  OBJECTIVES:-----------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL COLLECT DATA AND FACTS AND USE NEWLY LEARNED CONCEPTS TO CREATE A CREATURE, WHICH COULD SURVIVE LIFE IN ANTARCTICA.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL MAKE INFORMED AND INTELLIGENT CHOICES IN CHOOSING THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO CREATE A MODEL OF THIS CREATURE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PROCEDURE:-------------------------------------------------------------------  CREATE A VENN DIAGRAM WITH THE STUDENTS THAT COMPARE WHALES AND EMPEROR PENGUINS. DISCUSS WHAT SIMILARITIES THEY SHARE AND THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ENABLE THEM TO SURVIVE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.-----------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTE THE ATTACHED WORKSHEET AND GIVE THE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRAINSTORM ABOUT THE NEW CONCEPTS THAT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED ABOUT PENGUINS AND OTHER ANTARCTIC CREATURES.-----------------------------------------------------  DISPLAY A VARIETY OF MATERIALS (SEE MATERIALS LIST FOR-IDEAS) ON A WORKTABLE. ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO GIVE OTHER SUGGESTIONS AS WELL.-----------------------------------------------------  ALLOW STUDENTS TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY OR IN PAIRS TO CREATE THEIR ANTARCTIC-ADAPTABLE CREATURE.-----------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE THE CREATURE TO THE CLASS AND DESCRIBE WHAT FEATURES IT HAS THAT WOULD ENABLE IT TO LIVE IN ANTARCTICA.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INSTRUCTIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-MODIFICATIONS:----------------------------------------------------  FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS, THE TEACHER MAY WISH TO ENLARGE THE VENN DIAGRAM AND QUESTIONNAIRE. IT MAY ALSO BE HELPFUL TO PRINT THESE PAGES ON CONTRASTING PAPER. I USED A PHONIC EAR DEVICE DURING WHOLE GROUP INSTRUCTION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A HEARING IMPAIRED STUDENT.---------------------------------------------  I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RECONFIGURE THE FURNITURE-IN MY CLASSROOM FOR THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE. I USED ONE LARGE TABLE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM TO HOLD ALL THE CRAFT MATERIALS THE STUDENTS USED FOR CREATING THEIR CREATURES. THE STUDENTS SPREAD NEWSPAPER OVER THEIR DESKS SINCE THEY WERE USING CLAY. I USED A SMALL TABLE IN THE FRONT OF THE ROOM TO CONFERENCE WITH THE STUDENTS. HERE, WE DISCUSSED THE ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE THEY BEGAN CREATING WITH MATERIALS.----------------------------------------------------------------------  TIME REQUIRED:----------------------------------------------------  PRIOR TO BEGINNING THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE, I TOOK 2 DAYS TO INVENTORY MY CRAFT SUPPLIES AND THEN SPENT AN AFTERNOON AT WAL-MART STOCKING UP ON SOME NECESSARY ITEMS.---------------------------------------------  WE SPENT A 45-MINUTE PERIOD COMPLETING AND DISCUSSING THE VENN DIAGRAM. THE NEXT DAY, THE STUDENTS USED THEIR "INDEPENDENT WORK" PERIOD TO COMPLETE THEIR QUESTIONNAIRE AND DRAWING. AFTER SHARING THEIR IDEAS WITH THEIR CLASSMATES (A 45-MINUTE SESSION) THE STUDENTS MADE SOME ALTERATIONS TO THEIR DESIGN PROJECTS. FINALLY, WE SPENT ABOUT 45-MINUTES TO AN HOUR ACTUALLY CREATING THE CREATURES WITH CRAFT MATERIALS.---------------------------------------------  IF SOME STUDENTS FINISHED EARLY THEY WERE DIRECTED TO MAKE A MATE OR BABY FOR THEIR CREATURE.----------------------------------------------------------------------  RESOURCES:-------------------------------------------------------------  VENN DIAGRAM WORKSHEET (SEE ATTACHED)---------------------------------------------  DESIGN WORKSHEET (SEE ATTACHED)---------------------------------------------  CRAFT MATERIALS-- MODELING CLAY (ASSORTED COLORS), PIPE CLEANERS, GOOGLY EYES, TOOTHPICKS, FEATHERS, ETC.---------------------------------------------  ASSORTED BOXES TO CREATE DIORAMAS FOR THE CREATURES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ASSESSMENT PLAN:---------------------------------------------------------------------------  I FOUND THAT WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY/DESIGN PROJECT I USED A MORE INFORMAL ASSESSMENT PLAN. BY LOOKING AT THEIR QUESTIONNAIRES AND DISCUSSING THEIR RESPONSES AT CONFERENCE TIME I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH INFORMATION THE STUDENTS UNDERSTOOD AND WERE ABLE TO APPLY TO THIS DESIGN PROJECT. THE FINAL PRODUCT WAS ALSO A GOOD INDICATOR OF THEIR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  STUDENT WORK: NOT AVAILABLE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  REFLECTION:----------------------------------------------------  ALTHOUGH I HAVE DONE SIMILAR LESSONS, THIS WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT A FORMAL TECHNOLOGY/DESIGN PROJECT. I WAS GRATIFIED TO SEE THAT THE STUDENTS WERE EXTREMELY CREATIVE AND GAVE THEIR PROJECTS A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT. I WAS SURPRISED THAT SOME STUDENTS DID NOT WANT TO ALTER THEIR "ANTARCTIC ADAPTABLE ANIMAL" EVEN THOUGH OTHERS HAD POINTED OUT SOME FLAWS IN THEIR DESIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE STUDENT CHOSE TO USE PINK FEATHERS AND ANOTHER STUDENT INFORMED HER THAT PINK WOULD NOT BE A GOOD COLOR TO USE FOR CAMOUFLAGE IN ANTARCTICA. THE STUDENT SAID THAT SHE DIDN-T CARE, SHE LIKED PINK---------------------------------------------!  SOME STUDENTS GOT SO CAUGHT UP IN THIS EXPERIENCE THAT THEY TOOK IT A STEP FURTHER AND WROTE PUPPET SHOWS FOR THEIR CREATURES.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   LEARNING EXPERIENCE----------------------------------------------------------------------- #5  T--------------------------ITLE: THE BLUBBER GLOVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  LEARNING CONTEXT:----------------------------------------------------  NYS STANDARDS:------------------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #1- ANALYSIS, INQUIRY, AND DESIGN-----------------------------------------------------  MST STANDARD #4- SCIENCE-------------------------------------------------------------  OBJECTIVES:-----------------------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL EXPLORE THE USES OF BLUBBER AND EXPLAIN ITS PURPOSE FOR A PENGUIN.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL SUCCESSFULLY FOLLOW DIRECTIONS TO PERFORM AN EXPERIMENT.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS WILL MAKE PREDICTIONS BASED ON PRIOR KNOWLEDGE.-------------------------------------------------------------------  IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE STUDENTS TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER FOR THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IF YOU INCORPORATE COOPERATIVE LEARNING GROUPS INTO THE EXPERIENCE BE-SURE THAT EACH STUDENT KNOWS WHAT HE/SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.----------------------------------------------------------------------  PROCEDURE:-------------------------------------------------------------------  PAIR THE STUDENTS OR MAKE SMALL GROUPS OF THREE OR FOUR. GIVE EACH GROUP A TRAY OF MATERIALS AND A-BUCKET OF COLD WATER WITH ICE CUBES.-----------------------------------------------------  ASK STUDENTS WHAT FACTS WE MIGHT FIND OUT ABOUT PENGUINS USING THE MATERIALS ON THE TABLE AND THE BUCKET OF ICE WATER. LIST PREDICTIONS ON THE BOARD OR A CHART.-----------------------------------------------------  HAVE THE STUDENTS TAKE TURNS AND INSTRUCT ONE TEAM MEMBER TO PUT ON A SURGICAL GLOVE. HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT PLACE FIVE OR SIX TABLESPOONS OF SOLID SHORTENING INTO A SMALL RESEALABLE PLASTIC BAG AND "MUSH" IT UP.-----------------------------------------------------  NEXT, THE STUDENT WITH THE SURGICAL GLOVE PLACES HIS/HER HAND INTO THE RESEALABLE PLASTIC BAG WITH THE SHORTENING. ANOTHER TEAM MEMBER WILL THEN PLACE A RUBBERBAND AROUND THE STUDENT-S WRIST TO SECURE THE TOP OF THE PLASTIC BAG.-----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENT WITH THE BLUBBER GLOVE WILL NOW PLUNGE BOTH THE BLUBBER GLOVE HAND AS WELL AS HIS/HER UNPROTECTED HAND INTO THE ICE WATER. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS WILL TIME HOW LONG THE STUDENT CAN KEEP EACH HAND IN THE BUCKET OF WATER. ALLOW EACH TEAM MEMBER TO EXPERIENCE THIS ACTIVITY.-----------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCES THE STUDENTS FELT WHEN THEY HAD BOTH HANDS IN THE WATER. ASK THE STUDENTS TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS EASIER TO KEEP THE BLUBBER GLOVE HAND IN THE WATER LONGER. ASK THE STUDENTS HOW THIS EXPERIMENT IS RELATED TO PENGUINS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INSTRUCTIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS:-------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER TO DO CONDUCT THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE I USED OUR SCIENCE LAB. THE SET UP IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO WORKING WITH COOPERATIVE LEARNING GROUPS AND THERE IS A SINK WITH RUNNING WATER.-THIS EXPERIENCE COULD BE CARRIED OUT IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER PREPARATION.---------------------------------------------  I USED A PHONIC EAR DEVICE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A HEARING IMPAIRED STUDENT.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TIME REQUIRED:----------------------------------------------------  I SPENT ABOUT 20 MINUTES SETTING UP-THE SCIENCE LAB PRIOR TO THIS LESSON. I SPENT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR COLLECTING AND ORGANIZING MATERIALS. THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE ITSELF REQUIRED ABOUT 45-MINUTES. ASSESSMENT WAS ON GOING THROUGHOUT THE LESSON.----------------------------------------------------------------------  RESOURCES:----------------------------------------------------  FOR EACH PAIR OF STUDENTS YOU WILL NEED:---------------------------------------------  2 SMALL PLASTIC SURGICAL GLOVES (OR IN PLACE OF THE GLOVES, USE 2 MORE RESEALABLE PLASTIC BAGS)---------------------------------------------  2 PLASTIC RESEALABLE BAGS---------------------------------------------  1 POUND OF SOLID VEGETABLE SHORTENING (SUCH AS CRISCO)---------------------------------------------  2 RUBBERBANDS---------------------------------------------  A STOP WATCH---------------------------------------------  A BUCKET OF WATER WITH ICE CUBES----------------------------------------------------------------------  ASSESSMENT PLAN:----------------------------------------------------  THE STUDENTS TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BASED ON THE MATERIALS SET UP IN THE LAB. WE MADE A LIST OF POSSIBILITIES AND ALTERED THE LIST AS THE EXPERIENCE CONTINUED. THE STUDENTS ASKED QUESTIONS AND TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS WE WENT ALONG. I WAS ABLE TO ASSESS THEIR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THEY ASKED AND THE CONCLUSIONS THEY DREW DURING THE EXPERIENCE.----------------------------------------------------------------------  STUDENT WORK: NONE AVAILABLE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  REFLECTION:----------------------------------------------------  THIS EXPERIENCE WAS BASED ON A SIMILAR LESSON MY STUDENT TEACHER HAD TAKEN PART IN DURING AN UNDERGRADUATE COURSE. WE ALTERED IT SOMEWHAT TO MEET OUR NEEDS. WE ALSO CHANGED IT SO THAT THE STUDENTS WERE ALWAYS MAKING INQUIRIES AND TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE EXPERIENCE RELATED TO PENGUINS. IT DIDN-T TAKE THEM LONG---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
