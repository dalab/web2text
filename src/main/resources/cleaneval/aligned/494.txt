MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL----------- AFFAIRS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY I ACKNOWLEDGE------------THE TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF-THIS LAND,-THE GADIGAL (GAD -E- GAL) PEOPLE,----------- OF THE EORA (EE-OR-A) NATION-------------------------------------------------------------------------- I-UNDERSTAND-VERY------------WELL THAT THE-SUBJECT OF-THIS CONFERENCE RAISES-AGAIN THE HURT AND TRAUMA------------OF THE PAST AND THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR-ALL OF US.---------------------------------------------------------------------------I DO KNOW THAT----------- THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT WHAT----------- I AM ABOUT TO SAY WILL NOT BE APPEALING TO ALL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- HAVING SAID THAT,----------- I THANK THE ORGANISERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO YOU AN HONEST EXPLANATION----------- OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- LET ME ALSO SAY----------- THAT I THINK YOU HAVE SET YOURSELVES AN EXCEEDINGLY AMBITIOUS TASK IN----------- SEEKING TO DEVELOP A MODEL FOR REPARATIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, INDIVIDUAL----------- FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PAST PRACTICES----------- OF CHILD SEPARATION REPRESENT ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVELY AND ROUNDLY----------- CRITICISED CHAPTERS IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY, REGARDLESS OF HOW WELL INTENTIONED----------- OUR PREDECESSORS (OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR PARENTS) MIGHT----------- HAVE BEEN.-------------- THE EFFECTS ARE-STILL FELT BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF REMOVED ABORIGINAL----------- CHILDREN, THEIR-FAMILIES-AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE--999 PARLIAMENTARY----------- MOTION OF-RECONCILIATION PROVIDED-A VERY GENUINE EXPRESSION OF DEEP----------- AND SINCERE REGRET FELT BY MOST AUSTRALIANS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BRINGING----------- THEM HOME REPORT------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I KNOW THAT WE----------- ARE NOT HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE--- BRINGING----------- THEM HOME---- REPORT. THE QUESTION OF REPARATIONS REPRESENTS ONLY A----------- SUBSET OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND, AS YOU KNOW,------------THE IDEA OF-INDIVIDUAL-MONETARY COMPENSATION IS ITSELF ONLY ONE ASPECT----------- OF THE REPARATIONS AGENDA PROPOSED IN-THE REPORT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- OTHER FORMS OF----------- REPARATIONS INCLUDED ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND APOLOGY, GUARANTEES AGAINST----------- REPETITION, MEASURES OF RESTITUTION AND MEASURES OF REHABILITATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ITS RESPONSE----------- TO THE REPORT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMBRACED MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NATIONAL ORAL----------- HISTORY PROJECT-AND THE PARLIAMENTARY-MOTION OF REGRET ARE NOTHING IF----------- NOT AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF AND WARNING AGAINST REPETITION; THE RECORDS----------- ACCESS, PARENTING, FAMILY REUNION AND TRACING SERVICES ARE OBVIOUS FORMS----------- OF RESTITUTION AND, TOGETHER WITH THE NETWORK OF COUNSELLORS, THEY ALSO----------- CONSTITUTE A PROGRAM OF REHABILITATION FOR THOSE AFFECTED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THESE AND OTHER----------- WAYS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF REPARATION----------- AS PROPOSED BY HREOC, OF TRYING TO MAKE GOOD THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN----------- DONE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME COMMENTATORS----------- ARE COMPARING OUR APPROACH TO THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES. MAY I REPLACE----------- SOME FALLACIES WITH FACT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SOUTH AFRICAN----------- GOVERNMENT HAS STILL NOT ACCEPTED THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION'S------------RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SCHEME OF INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL COMPENSATION-------------- NOR HAS THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTED PROPOSALS FOR-SUCH A SCHEME------------(ALTHOUGH LIKE US, IT HAS FUNDED FAMILY REUNION, COUNSELLING AND OTHER----------- HEALING PROGRAMS) AND NOBODY IN NEW ZEALAND HAS EVER RECEIVED INDIVIDUAL----------- FINANCIAL COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF THE WAITANGI TRIBUNAL PROCESS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMONWEALTH----------- RESPONSE------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WE HAVE SAID, CLEARLY----------- AND CONSISTENTLY, THAT APPROPRIATE AND PRACTICAL STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN----------- TO ADDRESS THE HURT AND TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY THE SEPARATED CHILDREN----------- AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN DOING SO WE-HAVE FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR-ON FAMILY -----------REUNION, THE ISSUE IDENTIFIED IN-BRINGING THEM HOME AS----- "THE MOST----------- SIGNIFICANT AND URGENT NEEDS OF SEPARATED FAMILIES-----".-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND JUST A FEW----------- MONTHS AGO THE COMMONWEALTH REAFFIRMED THIS COMMITMENT BY EXTENDING----------- FUNDING FOR-THE LINK UP AND RELATED INITIATIVES TO BRING THE COMMONWEALTH'S----------- TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO $117 MILLION.----------------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPENSATION----------- AND A TRIBUNAL------------------ THE COMMONWEALTH (AND THE STATES) DID NOT, HOWEVER, ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS----------- CONCERNING INDIVIDUAL MONETARY COMPENSATION AND A NATIONAL COMPENSATION----------- TRIBUNAL: FIRST, MONETARY COMPENSATION TO INDIVIDUALS IS NOT SEEN AS----------- THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF DEALING WITH FAMILY SEPARATION; SECOND,----------- GIVEN THE VARIED AND LARGELY UNDOCUMENTED CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL------------HISTORICAL-EVENTS IN QUESTION, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVISE AND -----------APPLY ANY SUCH SCHEME IN A PRACTICAL AND EQUITABLE MANNER; AND------------------------------------------------------------THIRD,----------- AN ALTERNATIVE TRIBUNAL PROCESS DOES NOT-AVOID THE TRAUMA OF REVISITING----------- PAST EVENTS, NOR DOES IT BY KEEP MATTERS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE LEGAL----------- PROFESSION AND THE COURTS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- TODAY I WANT TO----------- FOCUS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVISING A PRACTICAL AND EQUITABLE SCHEME.---------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FIRST AND MOST----------- FUNDAMENTAL-QUESTION YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS THAT OF WHO YOU WOULD AND----------- WHO YOU WOULD NOT COMPENSATE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD----------- FINANCIAL COMPENSATION BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO----------- ARE SUBJECT TO CONTEMPORARY SEPARATION PRACTICES OR ONLY TO THOSE SEPARATED----------- IN THE PAST?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND IF YOU ARE----------- TALKING ONLY ABOUT THE PAST, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR CUT-OFF POINT?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- WOULD YOU RESTRICT----------- FINANCIAL COMPENSATION ONLY TO THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES OR WOULD YOU----------- EXTEND IT TO THEIR FAMILIES, DESCENDANTS AND COMMUNITIES (AS RECOMMENDED----------- BY HREOC)?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF YOU DECIDE THAT----------- THE CHILDREN, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF THE SEPARATED CHILDREN WOULD----------- NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION FROM THE TRIBUNAL, THEN YOU ARE FACED----------- WITH THE PROSPECT OF MUCH OF THE EXISTING LITIGATION CONTINUING IN THE------------COURTS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUT EVEN IF YOU----------- DO DECIDE TO GRANT-THEM ELIGIBILITY FOR COMPENSATION, THAT RAISES ANOTHER----------- SET OF QUESTIONS: HOW DO YOU DEFINE WHICH FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS----------- ARE ELIGIBLE?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- DO YOU TAKE A CULTURALLY----------- APPROPRIATE BROAD DEFINITION OF----- "FAMILY-----" AND----- "COMMUNITY-----"?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONE OF THE MOST------------BASIC QUESTIONS THAT A-STATUTORY COMPENSATION SCHEME-WOULD HAVE-TO ADDRESS----------- IS THAT OF DEFINING AND DECIDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES-THAT WARRANT COMPENSATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- YOU WOULD NEED----------- TO DISTINGUISH-THOSE CASES WHERE ADOPTION OR SEPARATION WAS VOLUNTARY----------- OR INVOLUNTARY BUT WARRANTED FROM THOSE WHERE SEPARATION WAS BOTH INVOLUNTARY----------- AND UNWARRANTED THE MERE FACT OF CHILDHOOD SEPARATION DOES NOT OF ITSELF----------- JUSTIFY COMPENSATION.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT A STATUTORY SCHEME WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER AND THEREFORE----------- LESS COSTLY THAN A NORMAL JUDICIAL PROCESS. HOWEVER, A LARGE PROPORTION----------- OF THE COSTS OF ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IN THESE CASES IS THE DIFFICULTY----------- OF RESEARCHING AND RELIABLY RECONSTRUCTING-EVENTS SO LONG AFTER THEY----------- ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT----------- FROM RECONSTRUCTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A RECENT CRIME AS IN A VICTIMS----------- COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL. IT IS ALSO VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CANADIAN SITUATION----------- WHERE AT LEAST EVERYONE KNOWS WHO WAS AND WHO WAS NOT ENROLLED IN THEIR----------- RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AS YOUR CONFERENCE----------- PAPERS THEMSELVES ACKNOWLEDGE------- "...-QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY------------OF INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF REMOVAL-- ...- ARE ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX AND VARIABLE..-----".-------------------------------------------------------------------------- LOCATING RELEVANT----------- DOCUMENTS AND WITNESSES SO LONG AFTER THE EVENT-WOULD CONFRONT BOTH------------THE CLAIMANTS AND THE RESPONDENTS BEFORE A TRIBUNAL, JUST THE SAME AS----------- IF THEY WERE BEFORE A COURT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THERE ARE ANOTHER----------- SERIES OF QUESTIONS: HOW WOULD YOU APPORTION THE ONUS OF PROOF, AND----------- WHAT WOULD BE THE BURDEN OF PROOF, THAT IS, TO WHOM WOULD YOU GIVE THE----------- BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND THIS WOULD----------- ALSO INVOLVE MAKING A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE RIGOUR OF-THE DECISION-MAKING----------- PROCESS AND THE EVENTUAL COSTS OF ANY COMPENSATION SCHEME, THE LESS----------- RIGOROUS THE PROCESS, THE GREATER THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF COMPENSATION,---------------------------------------------------------------------- BUT THE MORE----------- RIGOROUS THE PROCESS, THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-SCALE----------- JUDICIAL HEARING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- A FURTHER QUESTION----------- YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS WHAT AVENUES AND GROUNDS OF APPEAL SHOULD BE----------- ALLOWABLE FROM DECISIONS OF A COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THEN THERE IS THE----------- QUESTION OF WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING-THE COMPENSATION, AND------------WHAT WOULD BE THE LIMITS (IF ANY) ON-THE QUANTUM OF COMPENSATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ANSWER TO-THIS----------- QUESTION - COMBINED WITH THE QUESTIONS OF HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE ACTUALLY----------- REMOVED AND HOW MANY OF THEIR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WOULD BE----------- COMPENSATED - WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT ON THE OVERALL COST OF ANY SUCH SCHEME.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN ITS SUBMISSION----------- TO THE SENATE INQUIRY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMMONWEALTH ESTIMATED THE TOTAL----------- POTENTIAL COST OF COMPENSATION AS SOME $3.9 BILLION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF PEOPLE WISH----------- TO ARGUE THAT PURSUIT OF SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH THE COURTS IS TOO COSTLY,----------- THEN THEY MUST ALSO SERIOUSLY EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL COST OF ANY ALTERNATIVE------------SCHEME-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ADMINISTRATIVE----------- COSTS ALONE WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE IF A TRIBUNAL WERE ALSO TO HAVE AN----------- INVESTIGATIVE ROLE AND----- "A FULL TIME PRESENCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL----------------" [AS IS BEING RECOMMENDED IN YOUR CONFERENCE PAPERS].-------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHATEVER THE QUANTUM----------- OF INDIVIDUAL COMPENSATION,-THERE IS ALSO THE RELATED QUESTION OF WHO----------- WOULD PAY?-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ONE OPTION BEING------------PROPOSED IS A NATIONAL COMPENSATION FUND TO WHICH ALL GOVERNMENTS AND----------- CHURCHES WOULD CONTRIBUTE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN THE FIRST INSTANCE----------- THE STATES AND CHURCHES WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS----------- TO SUCH A FUND; AND THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO AGREE, IN EFFECT, TO A BLANK----------- CHEQUE, IN CASE THE INITIAL FUND PROVED INADEQUATE; AND, IN VIEW OF----------- THAT POSSIBILITY, THEY WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRE SEVERE STRICTURES----------- TO BE IMPOSED ON THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF ANY COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT WOULD BE MORE----------- REALISTIC AND MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATES AND THE CHURCHES TO BE----------- DIRECTLY LIABLE TO COMPENSATE THE CHILDREN WHOM THEY REMOVED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED----------- TODAY ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMONWEALTH ENCOUNTERED WHEN----------- IT EXAMINED THE IDEA.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ALTERNATIVE----------- OF PURSUING COMPENSATION THROUGH THE COURTS IS NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEM,----------- AS WE ALL KNOW.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUT A TRIBUNAL----------- PROCESS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY DO AWAY WITH THE TRAUMA OF REVISITING,----------- RECOUNTING AND RELIVING PAST EVENTS-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND IF IT WERE----------- TO HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY, A TRIBUNAL MECHANISM WOULD STILL ENTAIL THE----------- COMPLEX AND COSTLY PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTING AND VERIFYING DISTANT EVENTS.----------- NOR WOULD IT SEE AN END TO THE LITIGATION, SINCE NO ONE HAS PROPOSED----------- THAT COMMON LAW ALTERNATIVES (OR APPEALS) WOULD BE RULED OUT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S----------- VIEW THAT ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR COMPENSATION----------- SHOULD BE CHANNELLED TOWARDS FAMILY REUNION AND RELATED SERVICES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND WE ARE NOT----------- ALONE IN THAT VIEW. NOT ONE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO----------- PROVIDING FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- FEDERAL LABOR IS----------- THE SAME. INDEED, THE PREVIOUS FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT INITIATED THE----------- DEFENCE OF THE KRUGER AND BRAY CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE NT ABORIGINALS----------- ORDINANCE THAT WAS AT THE CENTRE OF THE CUBILLO AND GUNNER CASE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NSW LABOR GOVERNMENT----------- DEFENDED THE WILLIAMS CASE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- PREMIER CARR SAID,---------------- "I THINK WE'VE GOT TO MOVE BEYOND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN DO IT BY------------MAKING A CASH PAYMENT TO COMPENSATE FOR THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN OUR----------- PAST-----".-------------------------------------------------------------------------- AND MOST RECENTLY----------- THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE SHADOW MINISTER HAVE STOPPED TALKING----------- ABOUT A----- "COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL-----" (AS THEY DID UNTIL A FEW MONTHS----------- AGO) AND ARE NOW ONLY PROMISING A-------NATIONAL CONFERENCE-----" TO----------- DISCUSS----- "ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING THESE MATTERS-----".-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE WAY FORWARD------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE REAL QUESTION----------- IS HOW CAN WE BEST REDRESS THE EFFECTS OF PAST POLICIES AND PRACTICES?------------THIS IS A QUESTION NOT JUST-FOR THE COMMONWEALTH, BUT FOR STATE AND----------- TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS, THE CHURCHES AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.-------------- I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S $117 MILLION RESPONSE TO THE--- BRINGING----------- THEM HOME---- REPORT IS A SUBSTANTIAL DEMONSTRATION OF OUR COMMITMENT----------- TO ASSIST THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY PAST PRACTICES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- WE DO NEED TO MOVE----------- FORWARD AND, AS A COMMUNITY, WE NEED TO MAKE-SURE THAT WE DO ALL WE----------- CAN TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE DISADVANTAGE-THAT IS FACED BY SO-MANY INDIGENOUS----------- AUSTRALIANS TODAY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL OF US NEED----------- TO WORK HARD TO ENSURE A BETTER LIFE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
