YOU ARE AT THIS TIME FACING---- CHANGES. THE CHOICE WITH WHICH YOU ARE CONFRONTED IS NOT SO MUCH WHERE YOU WILL WORK, BUT---- WHETHER YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT A HIGH WATER MARK IN YOUR DEVELOPED LIFE OF SERVICE AND CAN---- THEREFORE GO NO FURTHER,-OR WHETHER-THERE ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN-YOU THOSE SPRINGS OF-----INTEREST AND THOSE INNER URGES WHICH WILL ENABLE YOU TO REACH OUTWARD AND FURTHER INTO THE---- LIFE OF THE SPIRIT. [50---SUCH IS OFT THE CHOICE WITH WHICH THE DISCIPLE IS FACED WHO---- REACHES CLOSE TO THE THREE SCORE YEARS AND-TEN OF ORDINARY HUMAN ENTERPRISE, AS YOU DO---- TODAY. THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE FACT THAT, FUNDAMENTALLY, EITHER DECISION IS RIGHT. FEW,---- HOWEVER, FACE THE CHOICE CONSCIOUSLY OR INTELLIGENTLY OR, HAVING MADE IT, ABIDE BY THE---- DECISION MADE. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ORDINARY ASPIRANT, THE CHOICE IS RELATIVELY---- UNIMPORTANT BECAUSE THE TIME EQUATION IS OF NO GREAT MOMENT AT THIS STAGE; A FEW YEARS---- MORE OR LESS ARE OF NO IMPORT IN THE ETERNITY OF-SOUL REACTION. THEREFORE, A DECISION TO---- RELAX, TO HOLD THE-POINT GAINED, BUT TO-REFRAIN FROM FURTHER STRUGGLE, HAS IN IT NO ROOM---- FOR CRITICISM. REMEMBER THIS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FROM THE---- STANDPOINT OF THE ACCEPTED DISCIPLE - SUCH AS YOU ARE - THERE MAY BE MORE TO THE CHOICE---- THAN AT FIRST APPEARS. IT MIGHT BE OF SERVICE TO YOU, AND TO ALL WHO MAY LATER READ THESE---- INSTRUCTIONS, IF I DWELT FOR A MOMENT UPON-THE INEVITABLE PROBLEM OF THE WORKING DISCIPLE,---- UPON THE PROBLEM OF THE MAN WHO REACHES THE AGE WHICH YOU HAVE REACHED. SHALL-HE REST BACK---- UPON HIS LAURELS (AND YOU HAVE LAURELS, MY BROTHER, AS I POINTED OUT IN MY LAST---- INSTRUCTION TO YOU) OR SHALL HE - TO USE A BIBLICAL PHRASE----- - "GIRD HIS LOINS---------" ANEW AND GO FORWARD WITH A-FRESH IMPETUS AND TO-A STILL HIGHER SUMMIT OF ATTAINMENT? SHALL---- HE DEMONSTRATE THE POWER OF THE SEVENTH WAVE WHICH WILL CARRY HIM FORWARD MUCH FURTHER---- UPON THE BEACH OF LIFE EXPRESSION OR WILL THE-STRONG UNDERTOW OF ORDINARY HUMAN FRAILTY---- PULL-HIM BACK FROM RENEWED EFFORT?----------  THE REASONS WHY A DISCIPLE MUST AT LEAST ENDEAVOR NOT TO RELAX UNDULY AND SHOULD PUSH---- ON IN SPITE OF FATIGUE (THE FATIGUE OF YEARS OF LIVING), IN SPITE OF THE INCREASING--------- "CREAKING-----" OF THE HUMAN APPARATUS AND THE INEVITABLE TENDENCY WHICH COMES FROM---- CONSTANT SERVICE AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH OTHERS, MIGHT BE ENUMERATED AS FOLLOWS:-------------  HE MUST ENDEAVOR TO CARRY THE-RHYTHM OF SERVICE AND OF FRUITFUL LIVING WITH HIM-WHEN-------- - FREE OF THE PHYSICAL BODY - HE STANDS UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEIL. THERE MUST BE NO-------- GAP IN THAT SERVICE.--------------  HE MUST ENDEAVOR AS FAR AS IN HIM LIES TO PRESERVE THE [503] CONTINUITY OF HIS-------- CONSCIOUSNESS AS A--- WORKING---- DISCIPLE AND SHOULD ALLOW NO GAP TO EMERGE BETWEEN HIS --------PRESENT POINT OF TENSION AND THAT POINT OF TENSION WHICH SUPERVENES AFTER THE DEATH-------- EXPERIENCE.----------------HE MUST ENDEAVOR TO CLOSE THE EPISODE OF THIS LIFE EXPERIENCE SO THAT IT IS APPARENT-------- THAT HE IS A MEMBER OF AN ASHRAM; HE MUST PERMIT NO BREAK IN THE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP,-------- OR ANY CESSATION TO THE FLOW OF ASHRAMIC LIFE THROUGH HIM TO THE WORLD OF MEN. THIS-------- ACTIVITY, ON ACCOUNT OF-THE NATURAL AND NORMAL-DETERIORATION OF THE-PHYSICAL VEHICLE AS IT --------GROWS OLDER, IS NOT SO-EASY A TASK; IT REQUIRES A DEFINITE CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT, THUS-------- INCREASING THE TENSION IN WHICH A DISCIPLE EVER LIVES.--------------  FOR ANY DISCIPLE IN MY-ASHRAM, THE PROBLEM IN THIS TIME OF WORLD CRISIS IS PECULIARLY-------- URGENT, AND THIS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:--------------------  A.--- MY ASHRAM IS THE MAIN AFFILIATED ASHRAM WITH THAT OF THE MASTER K.H. TO HIM, MY MASTER------------ (AS I AM YOURS), IS GIVEN THE TASK, ON A LARGE SCALE, OF WORLD EDUCATION ALONG NEW LINES.------------ THROUGH MY ASHRAM, WORKING UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF HIS, THE NEWER, ESOTERIC PRESENTATION------------ OF TRUTH IS TO BE GIVEN OUT. THE WORK THAT I HAVE ALREADY DONE - THROUGH MY BOOKS AND------------ THROUGH ALL THE TEACHING WHICH YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EMBODY - IS TO RENDER THE TEACHING OF------------ THE OTHER AND OLDER ESOTERIC SCHOOLS AND GROUPS ENTIRELY EXOTERIC. THERE IS LITTLE LEFT TO------------ THEM THAT IS NEW; THEY MUST NOW LINK UP WITH THE SOURCES WHICH I REPRESENT IF THEIR------------ LEADERS ARE TO PRESENT FRESH AND VITAL INFORMATION TO THEIR STUDENTS, OR THEY MUST TAKE------------ WHAT I HAVE CONVEYED TO THE WORLD, VIA A.A.B., AND THUS AGAIN REINTEGRATE INTO THE------------ ESOTERIC WHOLE.------------  B.--- DISCIPLES IN MY ASHRAM HAVE A DUAL RESPONSIBILITY TO STAND STEADY IN---- A-------- PRESERVATION------------ OF REALIZATION---- - IF I------- MAY USE SUCH A PHRASE. THIS STEADINESS MUST NOT BE------------ RELAXED IN ANY WAY AS OLD AGE DRAWS NEAR, AND IT MUST NOT BE PERMITTED-TO DISAPPEAR------------ THROUGH THE TRANSITION OF DEATH ITSELF. IT IS THROUGH-THE------ UNBROKEN CONSCIOUS ------------THINKING OF A WELDED GROUP OF DISCIPLES THAT THE MASTER OF AN ASHRAM WORKS. IT IS-NOT SO------------ MUCH THE ACTIVE-OUTER SERVICE OF A GROUP OF DISCIPLES WHICH IS OF-MAJOR IMPORTANCE (THOUGH------------ IT HAS NECESSARILY A VITAL PURPOSE) AS THE COHERENT, INTEGRATED GROUP THOUGHT WHICH IS SO-------------POTENT IN EFFECTING-CHANGES IN THE HUMAN-CONSCIOUSNESS.---------------------HE PECULIAR PROBLEM OF-THE PRESENT WORLD CRISIS AND THE-TERRIFIC READJUSTMENTS IN THE------------ HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, INCIDENT TO THE INAUGURATION-OF-A NEW CULTURE, CIVILIZATION AND WORLD------------ RELIGION, WARRANT MY PRESENTING THE MEMBERS OF MY ASHRAM (EVEN AFFILIATED GROUPS, SUCH AS-------------YOURS) WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE INTACT AND FREE FROM ALL DETERIORATION THEIR----------------- "STATE OF MIND-----" THROUGHOUT THE REMAINING YEARS OF THIS LIFE, THROUGH THE PROCESS------------ OF DISSOLUTION, AND ON INTO THE FREEDOM OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEIL. THIS PRESERVATION------------ OF CONSCIOUS INTEGRITY IS NO EASY TASK; IT REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING AND MOST DELIBERATE------------ EFFORT.-----------------------------------------------  I CALL YOU, THEREFORE, MY BROTHER, TO EXACTLY THIS EFFORT. THE CONSEQUENCES TO YOU WILL---- BE A MUCH HARDER LIFE OF SERVICE FROM NOW ON; THE RESULTS WILL BE THE CARRYING OUT OF YOUR---- PLANS FOR WORK WITH GREATLY INTENSIFIED EFFORT.----------  YOU SHOULD-NOW WORK IN CLOSER COOPERATION WITH A.A.B. AND F.B. THE TASK OF CARRYING---- ESOTERIC TRUTH INTO LATIN AND CATHOLIC AMERICA AND SOUTHERN EUROPE IS NO EASY UNDERTAKING.---- IT WILL BE SLOW. YOUR FOUNDATION MUST BE WELL AND TRULY LAID. THE QUALITY OF THOSE REACHED---- BY YOU IN-THE FUTURE IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE QUANTITY. BEAR THIS EVER IN MIND.---- RELINQUISH NOT THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE WORK YOU HAVE SO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED, BUT---- PROCEED WITH THEM AS HERETOFORE - NO MATTER WHERE MAY BE THE PLACE OF-YOUR PHYSICAL PLANE---- ENTERPRISE.----------  ONE OF THE MANY THINGS WHICH YOU NEED AT THIS TIME TO LEARN, AND WHICH YOU MUST---- INITIATE DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS, IS HOW TO GATHER PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WORK THROUGH---- THEM. THIS, AS YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT, IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A FIRST RAY DISCIPLE TO MASTER,---- PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SOUL RAY------ [505] AND THE RAY OF THE ASTRAL OR EMOTIONAL NATURE---- ARE BOTH FIRST RAY. IT IS EASY FOR THE FIRST RAY DISCIPLE TO WITHDRAW INTO HIS SOUL---- CONSCIOUSNESS, FAR EASIER THAN FOR ANY OTHER RAY TYPES, AND YOUR PROBLEM (AS IT IS ALSO---- THE PROBLEM OF J.W.K-P.) IS TO GIVE THE SECOND RAY PERSONALITY FULLER SWAY, AND THUS---- BALANCE THE FIRST RAY ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE DETACHMENT BY THE FUNCTIONING OF THE OPPOSITE---- QUALITY OF ATTACHMENT - SO DISTINCTIVE OF THE SECOND RAY NATURE. PONDER ON THIS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  AS I TOLD---- J.W.K-P. SOME YEARS AGO, A----- "DETACHED ATTACHMENT-----" (PARADOXICAL AS IT SOUNDS) IS---- THE GOAL OF THE FIRST RAY WORKING DISCIPLE. THIS IS EQUALLY TRUE OF YOU. YOU AND HE HAVE---- THE SAME EGOIC,-PERSONALITY AND MENTAL RAYS. HENCE THE CLOSE LINK WITH HIM WHICH YOU HAVE---- EVER REALIZED. HE IS A DISCIPLE OF THE MASTER M., TEMPORARILY WORKING IN MY ASHRAM. YOU---- HAVE BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE RANKS OF ACCEPTED DISCIPLES IN MY ASHRAM AND BY ME, BUT YOU---- WILL EVENTUALLY BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE-ASHRAM OF THE MASTER-M. THE-FREE INTERPLAY THUS ----ESTABLISHED BETWEEN MY-ASHRAM AND THAT OF THE MASTER M. IS-DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE IS THE---- INNER HEAD OF ALL ESOTERIC GROUPS, AND IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMING NEW-WORLD ORDER, THE---- TEACHING ASHRAMS ARE BEING STRENGTHENED BY-THE INFLOW OF FIRST RAY DISCIPLES. THIS SHOULD---- BE A POINT OF REAL INTEREST TO YOU.----------  WHAT, MY BROTHER, SHALL BE THE TYPE OF MEDITATION AND INTERIOR WORK WHICH YOU SHOULD BE---- DOING DURING THE COMING YEARS? I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU MEDITATE UPON THE----- "THREE---- ACTIVITIES------: OUTWARD MOVING, PERSISTENT ORIENTATION, AND INTERIOR WITHDRAWING OR---- ABSTRACTION. THE--- RELATION---- OF THESE THREE ACTIVITIES OR THREE ATTITUDES SHOULD FORM---- ONE ASPECT OF YOUR REFLECTION UPON THESE PHRASES; THE RELATIVE ACTIVITY INVOLVED IN EACH---- ATTAINED POSITION SHOULD CONSTITUTE ANOTHER; THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EACH OF THEM IN THE---- THREE-WORLDS, AND ALSO UPON SOUL LEVELS, DEMANDS CAREFUL AND-CONCENTRATED THOUGHT. WHAT,---- FOR INSTANCE, IS THE NATURE OF----- "OUTWARD MOVING-----" UPON THE ASTRAL PLANE? HOW WOULD--------- "PERSISTENT ORIENTATION-----" APPEAR OR EXPRESS ITSELF UPON THE MENTAL PLANE? OR--------- "ABSTRACTION AND WITHDRAWAL-----" UPON THE PHYSICAL LEVEL OF-CONSCIOUSNESS? HOW CAN---- YOU, AS A DISCIPLE, DISPLAY THESE ATTITUDES SIMULTANEOUSLY? I THINK YOU WILL ADMIT, MY---- BROTHER, THAT IN THESE THREE [506] CONCEPTS AND IN THEIR WORKING OUT IN THE DAILY LIFE---- WITHIN THE RING-PASS-NOT OF THE THREE WORLDS AND IN THE LIFE OF THE SOUL UPON ITS OWN---- PLANE, I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE THEME FOR MUCH THINKING DURING THE COMING YEARS.-TAKE EACH OF---- THESE PHRASES, THEREFORE, AND THINK EACH OF THEM OUT IN RELATION TO EACH OF THE THREE---- PLANES IN THE THREE WORLDS, AND TO EACH OTHER; CARRY THE SAME DIRECTED THINKING ON TO SOUL---- LEVELS AND SHIFT THE THEME THEN INTO THE THREE WORLDS OF THE SPIRITUAL TRIAD, REGARDING---- THE LOWER THREE WORLDS THEN AS REFLECTIONS OF THE HIGHER, TRIADAL THREE. KEEP NOTES OF ALL---- THE THOUGHTS OF REALITY WHICH COME TO YOU;. WATCH THE REACTIONS PRODUCED IN YOUR VEHICLES---- OF EXPRESSION, AND BECOME INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE CHANGES WHICH CONSCIOUS, DELIBERATE---- THINKING WILL BRING ABOUT IN YOU. THINK - IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT---IN YOUR HEART, AND ALSO ----IN YOUR MIND, AND ENDEAVOR TO COMPREHEND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO MODES OF---- THOUGHT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THIS---- REFLECTIVE WORK SHOULD CONSTITUTE YOUR MEDITATION-WORK IN THE FUTURE; IT WILL CONDITION-----YOUR INTERIOR DEVELOPMENT AND WILL-ALSO INEVITABLY MAKE-YOUR OUTER WORK MORE DYNAMIC.----------  ONE REASON WHY I HAVE EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR ATTACHMENT IN THIS INSTRUCTION IS THAT---- RIGHT ATTACHMENT RELEASES THE LOVE OF THE SOUL, AND ONLY LOVE, CONSCIOUSLY, INTELLIGENTLY ----AND DELIBERATELY APPLIED, CAN MAKE FOR SUCCESSFUL WORK, BOTH IN EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA---- - YOUR TWO RECOGNIZED FIELDS OF SERVICE. ONLY YOUR SECOND RAY PERSONALITY WILL HAVE THE---- CAPACITY TO REAWAKEN CONTACT WITH YOUR STUDENTS IN SPAIN OR HOLD STEADY THOSE ALREADY---- WORKING IN SOUTH AMERICA; IT IS THROUGH INDIVIDUALLY REFOUND, REAWAKENED AND REINSPIRED---- REALIZATION THAT THE WORK, PLANNED AND INTENDED BY ME, CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED---- FORWARD. SUCH IS YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK. ONLY YOUR SECOND RAY PERSONALITY CAN HAVE THE---- PATIENCE TO COVER THE MASS OF DETAIL NEEDED AND TO PERSIST IN THE FACE OF---- APPA-----R---ENT-------- NON-SUCCESS. MUCH SKILL IN ACTION WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS---- GOVERNED BY THE FIRST RAY AS ITS SOUL RAY, AND BY THE THIRD RAY AS-ITS PERSONALITY RAY.-----HENCE ITS LOVE OF POLITICS-AND OF TEMPORAL POWER; HENCE ALSO ITS INTENSELY COMMERCIAL AND---- FINANCIAL PREOCCUPATIONS. THE MENTAL RAY OF THIS CHURCH IS SIXTH RAY. HENCE ITS NARROW---- ONE-POINTEDNESS: [507] ITS EMOTIONAL BODY IS ALSO SIXTH RAY IN QUALITY, WHILST THE---- PHYSICAL RAY OF THE OUTER ORGANIZATION IS SEVENTH. THESE ARE POINTS WHICH SHOULD INTEREST---- YOU AND WHICH YOU NEED TO BEAR IN MIND AS YOU WORK. A REALIZATION OF THIS PECULIAR---- COMBINATION OF RAYS WILL DEMAND OF YOU, AND OF ALL WORKERS ALONG ESOTERIC LINES, GREAT---- SKILL IN ACTION.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WITH---- RENEWED ENDEAVOR, ENLIGHTENED UNDERSTANDING AND COURAGE, GO FORTH AGAIN, MY BROTHER, IN---- THE SERVICE OF THE LIGHT. I STAND EVER BEHIND YOU. ON THAT POINT, HAVE NO DOUBTS. I SHIELD---- AND PROTECT, BUT I LEAVE YOU FREE TO WORK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
