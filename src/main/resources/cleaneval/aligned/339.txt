--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HOW TO WIN BEFORE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ACTUALLY, THE TITLE IS A LITTLE MISLEADING; BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ALWAYS WIN,-BUT IF YOU-HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR YOUR APPEAL THIS INFORMATION SHOULD HELP YOU PRESENT YOUR CASE.--------------------- THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE CITIZENS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST THE ASSESSOR'S VALUATION OF THEIR PROPERTY.------ HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATURE REALIZED THAT COUNTIES GET MOST OF THEIR REVENUE FROM PROPERTY TAXES, AND IF IT WAS EASY TO GET THE VALUATION REDUCED COUNTIES WOULD SOON RUN OUT OF MONEY.------ THE LEGISLATURE HANDLED THIS BY SAYING IN EFFECT----- "OK, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL YOUR VALUATION BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AN UPHILL BATTLE FOR YOU TO WIN.--------------------------" THE LEGISLATURE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY SAYING,----- "THE ASSESSOR'S VALUATION IS ASSUME TO BE CORRECT.------ IN ORDER FOR THE TAXPAYER TO WIN HIS APPEAL HE MUST SHOW BY-------- CLEAR, COGENT, AND CONVINCING REASONING--------- THAT THE ASSESSOR HAS MADE A MISTAKE.-----------" CLEAR, COGENT, AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE MEANS A QUANTUM OF PROOF WHICH IS LESS THAN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, BUT MORE THAN A MERE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE.------ IT IS THE QUANTUM OF EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO CONVINCE THE TRIER OF FACT THAT THE ULTIMATE FACT IN ISSUE IS----- "HIGHLY PROBABLY.-----------" MOST BOARDS OF EQUALIZATION TAKE THIS TO MEAN THAT THE TAXPAYER'S EVIDENCE MUST MAKE IT PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THE ASSESSOR MADE A MISTAKE.-------THE KEY WORD IN THE LAST SENTENCE IS THE-WORD----- "EVIDENCE-----".------ YOU MUST GIVE GOOD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT YOUR APPEAL.----------------------LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.------ YOU AND YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR GET A LETTER FROM THE ASSESSOR INFORMING YOU THAT THE VALUE OF EACH HOUSE HAS RISEN TO----,------------BOTH HOUSES-ARE IDENTICAL AND BOTH-OF YOU-FILL AN APPEAL BEFORE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.------ YOUR NEIGHBOR COMES BEFORE THE BOARD AND SAYS,----- "THIS ASSESSMENT IS RIDICULOUS; MY-HOUSE CAN'T-POSSIBLY BE WORTH MORE THAN $55,-----------I ONLY PAID $35,000 FOR IT SEVEN YEARS AGO.------ I PLAN TO LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE IN THIS HOUSE.------- I'M NOT GOING TO SELL IT TO MAKE A FAST BUCK--------------------------!" WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD, YOU SAY,----- "THIS ASSESSMENT IS RIDICULOUS; MY HOUSE CAN'T BE WORTH MORE THAN $55,000.-----------" THEN YOU SHOW THE BOARD THAT THREE OTHER HOUSES IN THE AREA HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE LAST YEAR.------- THE HOUSE THAT WAS IDENTICAL TO YOURS SOLD FOR $54,000, ANOTHER HOUSE THAT IS SIMILAR TO YOURS SOLD FOR $56,-----------THE LAST HOUSE, WHICH WAS BETTER THAN YOURS, SOLD FOR $66,-----------YOU SHOW THE BOARD THAT NO HOUSES IN THE AREA HAVE SOLD FOR MORE THAN $66,-----------NOW THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE EXAMPLE BY 99 TIMES OUT OF 100 THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WILL RULE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:------ YOU WIN YOUR APPEAL, BUT YOUR NEIGHBOR'S APPEAL IS DENIED.------ THE REASONING BEHIND THESE TWO RULINGS IS THIS:------- YOUR NEIGHBOR DID NOT PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTED HIS CONTENTION THAT THE ASSESSOR MADE A MISTAKE, ON THE OTHER HAND YOU GAVE SOME GOOD HARD EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTED YOUR APPEAL.--------------------- LET ME EXPLAIN ABOUT THE SORT OF EVIDENCE THAT BOARDS OF EQUALIZATION LIKE AND DON'T LIKE TO SEE.------ IF YOU TELL US THAT YOUR ROOF LEAKS AND THAT THERE IS WATER DAMAGE IN THE HOUSE, BRING US SOME PICTURES THAT SHOW THE DAMAGE.------ BRING AN ESTIMATE FROM A CONTRACTOR SHOWING HOW MUST IT WILL COST TO FIX THE ROOF.------ IF YOUR FOUNDATION IS CRACKED AND THE FLOOR IS BUCKLED, BRING SOME ESTIMATES OF THE-COST TO REPAIR EVERYTHING.------ BRING US PICTURES THAT BACKUP YOUR CONTENTIONS.------ IF THE ASSESSOR SAYS YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH $50,000-AND YOU HAVE TRIED FOR THE LAST YEAR TO SELL THE HOUSE FOR----,000 AND HAD NO OFFERS, BRING-A LETTER FROM YOUR REALTOR CONFIRMING IT.------ SHOW US THAT A HOUSE SIMILAR TO YOURS, SOLD FOR A GOOD DEAL LESS-THAN THE ASSESSED VALUE OF YOUR HOUSE.------ THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS DELIGHTED TO SEE GOOD HARD EVIDENCE.--------------------- THE BOARD IS NOT IMPRESSED WITH APPEALS BASED ON EMOTION.------ DON'T JUMP UP AND DOWN ABOUT THE PERCENT OF TAX INCREASE.------ IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE-PERCENTAGE OF INCREASE IS AS LONG AS THE MARKETPLACE WILL SUPPORT THE VALUE.------ DON'T TELL US THAT-YOUR GRANDFATHER BOUGHT THE PROPERTY FOR $100 FIFTY YEARS AGO AND THAT YOU HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF EVER SELLING OUT JUST TO MAKE A BUCK.------ THE BOARD COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS; THE ONLY THING WE CARE ABOUT IS-THE PRESENT MARKET VALUE.----------------------THE-BEST PLACE-TO GET SALES INFORMATION IS THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. -------ALL RECORDED SALES IN THE COUNTY ARE AVAILABLE-THERE.------ IT WILL TAKE TIME AND ENERGY BUT THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO YOU.------ THE EASIEST WAY TO-GET ANOTHER APPRAISAL IS TO HIRE A FEE APPRAISER.------ THE FEE APPRAISER CAN DO ALL THE WORK FOR YOU.------- THE DOWNSIDE TO HIRING A FEE APPRAISER IS THE COST.------ IN ADDITION, THE FEE APPRAISER'S REPORT MAY OR MAY NOT SUPPORT YOUR APPEAL.--------------------- THERE ARE THREE METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE MARKET VALUE OF A PIECE OF PROPERTY:------ THE DIRECT SALES COMPARISON METHOD, THE COST APPROACH TO VALUE, AND THE INCOME APPROACH-TO VALUE.------ WHILE-EACH METHOD HAS ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, THE DIRECT SALES COMPARISON METHOD GENERALLY CARRIES THE MOST WEIGHT.------ ALMOST ANYONE CAN USE THE DIRECT SALES COMPARISON METHOD; ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED CAN BE FOUND IN-THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE.------ IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE COST APPROACH-OR THE INCOME APPROACH IT MIGHT BE WISE TO TAKE TO YOUR-ACCOUNTANT AND AN ATTORNEY.----------------------BRING US AN ARGUMENT BASED-ONLY ON EMOTION AND OUTRAGE AND YOU WON'T HAVE A CHANCE; BRING US SOME GOOD HARD PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE AND THE BOARD MAY BE ABLE TO GRANT YOUR APPEAL.----------------------------- PACIFIC COUNTY BOARD OF EQUALIZATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------
