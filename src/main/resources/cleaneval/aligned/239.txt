THE TALKS, WHICH ALSO INCLUDE RUSSIA, HAVE-BEEN STALLED FOR NEARLY A YEAR.--------------------------------- A BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, AS WELL AS A CONGRESSIONAL SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER, TOLD--------------------------------- ARMS CONTROL TODAY------- THAT RECENT NORTH KOREAN STATEMENTS, ALONG WITH A MODEST AMOUNT OF NEW INTELLIGENCE, HAVE INCREASED U.S. OFFICIALS------- CONCERN THAT NORTH KOREA MAY TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS. PYONGYANG HAS NOT TESTED SUCH WEAPONS, ALTHOUGH IT HAS THREATENED TO DO SO.--------------------------------- IN ADDITION, A SENIOR NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT SAID APRIL 18 THAT PYONGYANG HAD HALTED THE OPERATION OF ITS FIVE-MEGAWATT NUCLEAR REACTOR, AN ACTION THAT COULD PERMIT IT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL PLUTONIUM FOR USE AS FISSILE MATERIAL IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS AFTER NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCED THAT IT POSSESSES NUCLEAR WEAPONS.--------------------------------- THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT NORTH KOREA POSSESSES ONE OR TWO PLUTONIUM-BASED NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MAY POSSESS ENOUGH FISSILE MATERIAL FOR SEVERAL MORE. WHETHER PYONGYANG IS IN THE-PROCESS OF-AUGMENTING ITS PURPORTED NUCLEAR ARSENAL, HOWEVER,-REMAINS UNCLEAR.----------------------------------------------------------------- TALKS------------------------ ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES CONFIRMED AN APRIL ---WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORT THAT THE UNITED STATES SENT AN URGENT DIPLOMATIC MESSAGE TO ALLIES EARLIER IN THE-MONTH NOTIFYING THEM OF U.S. CONCERNS THAT NORTH KOREA MIGHT-CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST. THE MESSAGE ALSO ASKED AT LEAST CERTAIN TALKS PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA, TO URGE PYONGYANG TO REFRAIN-FROM PROVOCATIVE BEHAVIOR.--------------------------------- THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN MORE-SUPPORTIVE-OF ENGAGING NORTH KOREA THAN HAS THE UNITED STATES. NEVERTHELESS, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINSTER BAN KI-MOON WARNED NORTH KOREA AGAINST TESTING APRIL 25, STATING THAT SUCH AN ACT WOULD RESULT IN PYONGYANG-------SX-------ISOLATION.---------------------------------------X THE CONGRESSIONAL SOURCE SAID THE OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD LIKELY FOLLOW SUIT, BUT PERHAPS NOT PUBLICLY.--------------------------------- ALTHOUGH CONVEYING IMPATIENCE WITH PYONGYANG-------S BEHAVIOR, U.S. OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE TALKS. DEPARTMENT OF STATE SPOKESPERSON ADAM ERELI ACKNOWLEDGED APRIL 25 THATX-------THE STALEMATE HAS GONE ON--------LONGER THAN ANY OF US WOULD HAVE LIKED------- BUTX-------VEHEMENTLY------- DENIED THAT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AREX-------AT THE END OF OUR-ROPE ON THIS.---------------------------------------- IN AN APRIL----NEWS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ALSO INDICATED CONTINUED U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE TALKS, ADDING THAT OTHER ACTIONS, SUCH AS INVOLVING THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN THE MATTER, WOULD DEPEND ON OTHER PARTICIPANTS------- SUPPORT. CHINA, WHICH HAS VETO POWER-ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND SOUTH KOREA HAVE RESISTED ASKING THAT BODY TO TAKE UP THE ISSUE.--------------------------------- THE DURATION OF THE CURRENT DIPLOMATIC TRACKX-------IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR CONSENSUS AMONGST OURSELVES,------- BUSH SAID.--------------------------------- FOR ITS PART, NORTH KOREA CONTINUES TO EXPRESS A WILLINGNESS TO RETURN TO THE TALKS, ALBEIT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.--------------------------------- PYONGYANG SAYS IT WANTS THE UNITED STATES TO END ITSX-------HOSTILE POLICY------- TOWARD NORTH KOREA, EXPRESS A WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH THE CURRENT REGIME, AND RETRACT SECRETARY OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA RICE-------S REFERENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT AS ONE OF SEVERALX-------OUTPOSTS OF TYRANNY------- DURING HER JANUARY 2005 CONFIRMATION HEARINGS.-------------------------------------------------------- (SEE--------------------------------- ACT-------, APRIL 2005.)------------------------------------- PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO HINTED THAT PYONGYANG MAY CHANGE ITS STANCE ON DISCUSSING ITS SUSPECTED URANIUM-ENRICHMENT PROGRAM. THE CONGRESSIONAL SOURCE, AS WELL AS A WITNESS TO AT LEAST ONE SUCH DISCUSSION, TOLD--------------------------------- ARMS CONTROL TODAY------- THAT THESE OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED TO UNOFFICIAL INTERLOCUTORS WITHIN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS THAT PYONGYANG IS WILLING TO DISCUSS U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROGRAM IN PRIVATE BILATERAL TALKS.--------------------------------- SUSPICIONS THAT NORTH KOREA IS PURSUING THE CAPABILITY TO ENRICH URANIUM HAVE PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE CURRENT NUCLEAR CRISIS. THE STANDOFF BEGAN IN OCTOBER 2002 AFTER A VISITING U.S. DELEGATION ACCUSED PYONGYANG OF PURSUING SUCH A PROGRAM COVERTLY. NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS ADMITTED AS MUCH, U.S. OFFICIALS SAID LATER, BUT PYONGYANG HAS DENIED THAT IT MADE SUCH AN ADMISSION. HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM ARE THE TWO TYPES OF FISSILE MATERIALS USED IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.--------------------------------- THE ISSUE HAS ALSO BECOME A MAJOR POINT OF CONTENTION IN THE SIX-PARTY TALKS. DURING THE LAST ROUND, THE UNITED STATES INSISTED THAT NORTH KOREA DISCLOSE AND DISMANTLE THE PROGRAM, BUT THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION DENIED THAT IT HAS SUCH A PROGRAM AND REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER. PYONGYANG HAS NOT PUBLICLY CHANGED THIS POSITION.--------------------------------- THE UNITED STATES HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT IT WILL NOT ENGAGE NORTH KOREA IN BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT HAS MET PRIVATELY WITH THE NORTH KOREANS DURING THE SIX-PARTY TALKS.---------------------------------------------------------------- (SEE--------------------------------- ACT-------, JULY/AUGUST 2004.)--------------------------------------------------------------------- TESTING AND THREATS----------------------- ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL SOURCE, THE-UNITED STATES HAS IDENTIFIED--------ABOUT HALF-A DOZEN------- POSSIBLE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TESTING SITES AND HAS RECENTLY SEENX-------FOGGY---------NDICATIONS-THAT PYONGYANG MAY BE PREPARING TO TEST. HOWEVER, SOUTH KOREA-------S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER KWON JIN-HO DISMISSED REPORTS OF SUCH PREPARATIONS IN AN APRIL 27 RADIO-INTERVIEW, STATING THATX-------NO UNUSUAL [NORTH KOREAN] MOVES HAVE BEEN DETECTED.---------------------------------------X WASHINGTON-------S CONCERNS STEM MAINLY FROM PYONGYANG-------S RECENT PROVOCATIVE STATEMENTS, RATHER THAN ANY NEW INTELLIGENCE, THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAID.--------------------------------- A MARCH 31 NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT DESCRIBING THE COUNTRY AS AX-------FULL-FLEDGED NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATE------- IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE.

WHETHER PYONGYANG HAS SINCE BUILT WEAPONS IS UNCLEAR.--------------------------------- NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2002 THAT IT WAS RESTARTING THE REACTOR, WHICH, ALONG WITH NORTH KOREA-------S REPROCESSING FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY 8,000 SPENT FUEL RODS, HAD BEEN FROZEN UNDER THE 1994 AGREEMENT. LATER THAT MONTH, NORTH KOREA EJECTED INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) INSPECTORS CHARGED WITH MONITORING THE FREEZE. THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 2003 THAT NORTH KOREA HAD RESTARTED THE REACTOR.--------------------------------- PYONGYANG-------S ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWED THE ESCALATION OF BILATERAL DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS AFTER THE OCTOBER 2002 MEETING WITH THE U.S. DELEGATION.----------------------------------PYONGYANG HAS SINCE CLAIMED TO HAVE-REPROCESSED THE SPENT FUEL PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO IAEA MONITORING.
