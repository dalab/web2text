GRANDMA ILONA RICHARDSON, COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO---- ILONA RICHARDSON (COEUR D'ALENE, ID 83815) HRICHARDSON@ISPWEST.COM--------------- MICHELLE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ME. SHE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE IN HER BATTLE, SHE ALWAYS HAD HER SENSE OF HUMOR AND MADE THE BEST OF THE SITUATION.. I CAME IN CONTACT WITH MICHELLE LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH A COLONOSCOPY TO RULE OUT COLON CANCER. I WAS VERY SCARED, BEING ONLY 23 AND HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS AT A YOUNG AGE, SHE WAS ABLE TO RELATE TO THE ANXIETY AND FEAR I WAS EXPERIENCING. SHE GAVE ME HOPE AND COURAGE NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE. THANKFULLY, I WAS CLEAR, BUT LATER THAT YEAR I LOST MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY GRANDFATHER BOTH TO CANCER. THEY WERE BOTH ONLY IN THEIR 60'S AND THEY RAISED ME, SO THIS WAS LIKE LOSING MY PARENTS. HER WORDS GAVE ME STRENGTH, AND HER STORY INSPIRED ME TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY DAY AND TO LIVE MY LIFE TO THE-FULLEST. I WILL TRULY MISS MICHELLE AND MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO HER GRIEVING FAMILY AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH. MAY THEY FIND SOME PEACE-IN KNOWING MICHELLE IS NO LONGER SUFFERING.---- KATE SHANDELSON (SAUGUS, CA) AUTOMATON-MINDSPRING.COM-------------- TO THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF-MICHELLE, WE ARE SADDENED TO HEAR OF MICHELLE'S PASSING.
