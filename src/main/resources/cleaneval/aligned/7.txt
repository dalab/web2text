IRELAND CONFLICT-RELIGION VS POLITICS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS LIKELY ONE OF THE MOST CLOSELY WATCHED AND-HOTLY DEBATED DISPUTES OF OUR TIME.- SPANNING NOW FOR OVER A CENTURY, WHAT-REMAINS AT THE ROOT OF THE CONFLICT IS UNCLEAR.- MANY THEORIES HAVE DEVELOPED-OVER TIME, YET NO ONE THEORY SEEMS TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE COMPLEX STRUGGLE.- THE CONFLICT HAS BEEN DIVIDED DOWN MANY LINES; ETHNICALLY BETWEEN THE BRITISH-AND THE IRISH, GEOGRAPHICALLY, BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH OF IRELAND, AND-RELIGIOUSLY BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS.- THEORIES THAT HAVE EMERGED HAVE-POINTED TO CAUSES SUCH AS LAND CLAIMS AND A NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY, ETHNICITY AND-CULTURE, AND PERHAPS MOST FREQUENTLY, RELIGION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE THE-CONFLICT.- IN FACT, WHAT IS MORE LIKELY IS THAT ELEMENTS OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES-LIE AT THE ROOT OF WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "THE TROUBLES".-THE HISTORY OF THIS CONTEMPORARY CONFLICT IS DETAILED, BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE.-WHILE DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE DISPUTE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE PROBLEM BEGAN-CENTURIES AGO, I WILL EXAMINE BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF-THE "TROUBLES" FROM THE END-OF THE 19TH CENTURY FORWARD.- FOR MUCH OF ITS HISTORY, IRELAND HAS LIVED UNDER-BRITISH RULE.-- AS THE 19TH CENTURY DREW TO A CLOSE, BRITAIN BECAME AWARE OF A-RAPIDLY GROWING SENSE OF IRISH NATIONALISM.- IN 1870, THE IRISH PROTESTANTS-PLACED THE NOTION OF HOME RULE ON THE FRONT BURNER IN AN ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE-IRELAND FROM THE RAPID SECULARISM THAT WAS OCCURRING IN BRITAIN.- VERY QUICKLY-THE MOVEMENT WAS PICKED UP BY IRISH CATHOLICS WHO SAW HOME RULE AS A TRULY-NATIONALIST IDEAL, AND BY--874 THEY HAD DOMINATED THE MOVEMENT.- THIS PUSHED THE-PROTESTANTS BACK TOWARDS UNIONISM AND WAS ONE OF THE MANY STRIKES AGAINST THE-IDEA OF A UNITED IRELAND.----  FEELING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO GRANT IRELAND HOME RULE, BRITAIN BEGAN TO TALK-ABOUT MAKING EFFORTS TO--PACIFY" IRELAND, IMPLYING THAT IT WOULD INDEED GRANT-THEIR WISH.- TALKS OF HOME RULE WERE THEN DELAYED.- THE IRISH SAW THE DELAY AS A-FURTHER POLITICAL TACTIC OF A BRITISH PARLIAMENT WHO HAD NO INTENTION OF-GRANTING THEM AUTONOMY.- THE BRITISH STRUGGLED WITH THE QUESTION OF WHO WOULD-RUN THIS COMPLEX SOCIETY THAT WAS SO HEAVILY ROOTED IN IMPERIALISTIC TRADITION,-AND WHO AT BEST HAD A SHAKY INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE.- THIS DELAY-FURTHER DIVIDED IRISH NATIONALISTS.- NEW RADICAL FORMS OF NATIONALISM EMERGED,-SUCH AS THE IRISH REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD AND SINN FEIN, WHOSE LEADERS WERE-WILLING TO USE VIOLENT MEANS IF NECESSARY TO SECURE IRISH INDEPENDENCE.-A FURTHER DIVIDE BETWEEN PROTESTANTS-AND CATHOLICS ALSO DEVELOPED AT THIS TIME,-PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCE OF ULSTER.- UNIONISTS GROUPS, WHO WERE-PROTESTANT BY RELIGION AND BRITISH BY TRADITION, WERE OPPOSED TO HOME RULE-BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT IRELAND SHOULD MAINTAIN HER TIES TO BRITAIN.- IN AN-EFFORT TO RESIST THE HOME RULE MOVEMENT, THEY BEGAN TO ORGANIZE.- THEY CREATED A-PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ULSTER, COMPLETE WITH A CONSTITUTION AND RAISED AN-ARMY TO DEFEND IT.- FURTHER TO THAT, IN 1912 THEY CREATED WHAT WAS CALLED THE-`SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT' WHICH BOUND THEIR FOLLOWERS TO USE-ANY MEANS-NECESSARY TO RESIST HOME RULE.- THEY GATHERED OVER A HALF A MILLION SIGNATURES,-SOME OF THE UNIONISTS EVEN SIGNING IN THEIR OWN BLOOD.----  THE DEBATE OVER HOME RULE WAS PUT ON HOLD WHEN WORLD WAR I BROKE OUT.- THE-DUBLIN EASTER RISING OF----- SERVED AS A REMINDER TO THE BRITISH THAT THE-QUESTION OF IRELAND'S INDEPENDENCE WOULD NEED TO BE ANSWERED WHEN THE WAR WAS-OVER.- OVER 220 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND OVER 600 MORE INJURED WHEN IRISH-REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD REBELS TOOK HOLD OF DUBLIN.- THE BRITISH, OUTNUMBERING-THE REBELS 20 TO 1, EVENTUALLY TOOK BACK THE CITY SIX DAYS LATER.- IN THE FACE-OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A POLITICAL VICTORY FOR THE BRITISH, THEY MADE THE ERROR-OF EXECUTING THE SURVIVING IRISH REBELS, MARTYRING THEM AND INSTILLING ANGER AND-DETERMINATION IN THE MINDS OF MANY IRISH NATIONALISTS.----  THE DILEMMA OF HOME RULE AS THE BRITISH SAW IT WAS HOW TO GIVEN THE IRISH-CATHOLICS WHAT-THEY WANTED WHILE STILL PROVIDING FOR THE IRISH-PROTESTANTS OF-ULSTER.- THEIR ANSWER WAS THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT OF 1920, WHICH CREATED-TWO SEPARATE PARLIAMENTS, ONE IN THE NORTH AND ONE IN THE SOUTH.- THESE-PARLIAMENTS WERE CHARGED-WITH THEIR OWN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, BUT ALL FOREIGN-AFFAIRS AND INCOME TAX COLLECTION REMAINED IN-THE HANDS OF THE BRITISH.-FURTHER RESISTANCE AND GUERILLA WARFARE EVENTUALLY LED TO THE ANGLO-IRISH TREATY-OF 1921, WHICH OUTLINED THE CREATION OF THE IRISH FREE STATE, NOW KNOWN AS THE-REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.- IT WAS MADE UP OF THE PROVINCES OF MUNSTER, LEINSTER AND-CONNAUGHT, AS WELL AS THREE OF THE NINE COUNTIES OF ULSTER - DONEGAL, MONAGHAN,-AND CAVAN.--- NORTHERN IRELAND, NOW A LEGAL ENTITY MADE OF UP THE SIX REMAINING-COUNTIES OF ULSTER - FERMANAGH, ARMAGH, TYRONE, LONDONDERRY, ANTRIM AND DOWN- -REMAINED UNDER BRITISH RULE.-- THE DIVISION CREATED AN ALMOST ENTIRELY CATHOLIC-POPULATION IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND AND A SUBSTANTIAL PROTESTANT MAJORITY IN THE-NORTH.----  THE PARTITIONING OF IRELAND WAS VIEWED BY THE SOUTH AS A TEMPORARILY SOLUTION TO-THE `PROTESTANT' PROBLEM IN THE NORTH.- THEY MAINTAINED THAT NOT AN INCH OF-IRISH LAND WOULD BE GIVEN UP TO THE BRITISH.- IN 1937, THE CREATION OF THE IRISH-CONSTITUTION IN THE SOUTH LAID-CLAIM TO THE SIX COUNTIES THAT REMAINED UNDER-BRITISH RULE AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY WERE BEING HELD TEMPORARILY AND-ILLEGALLY.----  POPULATION-DIVISIONS HAD ALWAYS EXISTED IN THE TWO MAJOR CITIES OF WHAT WAS NOW-NORTHERN IRELAND.- BELFAST, THE LARGEST CITY AND CENTER OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAD-A LARGELY PROTESTANT POPULATION, WHERE AS DERRY, A KEY CENTER FOR THE SHIPPING-INDUSTRY HAD A LARGELY CATHOLIC POPULATION.- BOTH CITIES ALSO BOASTED A-CONCENTRATED MINORITY GROUP, YET CONFLICT WAS NOT ALWAYS INHERENT, AS THE-MINORITY DID NOT POSE A THREAT TO THE MAJORITY'S WAY OF LIFE.- WITH THE RISE OF-INDUSTRIALIZATION, THERE WAS A RAPID MIGRATION OF PEOPLE TO BELFAST,-PREDOMINANTLY IN SEARCH OF WORK AND HOUSING.- THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE-MIGRATING WERE CATHOLIC, WHICH BEGAN TO PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR THE PROTESTANT-COMMUNITY.- NOT ONLY WERE THEY COMPETING FOR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT, BUT THE-PERCENTAGE OF CATHOLICS IN BELFAST WAS NOT ONLY RISING, BUT THEY WERE BEGINNING-TO ORGANIZE.- AS THEY LEARNED HOW TO USE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS TO WIELD-INFLUENCE, THE PROTESTANTS BECAME MORE RESENTFUL OF THEIR PRESENCE.- TO THE-CATHOLICS, THEIR EVENTUAL CONTROL OVER BELFAST WAS INEVITABLE.- AS BERNARD-HUGHES, THE ONLY ROMAN CATHOLIC REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BELFAST CITY COUNCIL IN-1857 STATED, "THIS TOWN (BELFAST) IS GOVERNED BY PROTESTANTS, BUT THE BONE AND-SINEW OF THE TOWN IS ROMAN CATHOLIC."(BREWER & HIGGINS 1998). WHAT WAS BORN WAS-A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE WORKING CLASS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY, WHILE THE MIDDLE AND-UPPER CLASSES STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN PEACEFUL CONTROL.- THE PEACE WAS NOT TO-LAST.----  THE DECADES TO FOLLOW WOULD BE WROUGHT WITH VIOLENCE.- BATTLES WOULD BE WAGED-BETWEEN THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA), THE ULSTER DEFENSE ASSOCIATION AND-BRITISH PARAMILITARIES.- THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WOULD BE KILLED IN BOMB-BLASTS, RIOTS AND SECTARIAN KILLINGS.- EVEN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS LEND SUPPORT TO-THESE GROUPS, BECAUSE THE BATTLE FOR THE "CAUSE" ON EITHER SIDE IS PARAMOUNT.- WHAT IS IT THAT TURNS THESE COMMON CITIZENS INTO KILLING MACHINES?- WHAT-PREVENTS ANY KIND OF PEACE AGREEMENTS FROM TAKING HOLD IN THIS CONFLICT RIDDEN-NATION?- THE ANSWER IS PERHAPS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE CONFLICT.-THEORISTS HAVE STRUGGLED OVER A SOLUTION TO "THE TROUBLES" IN NORTHERN IRELAND-FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.- YET IN SEEKING THIS SOLUTION, FEW HAVE TRULY GOTTEN-INSIDE THE CONFLICT.- NORTHERN IRELAND'S BATTLE HAS PRODUCED NOT ONLY AN-ENORMOUS HUMAN COST BUT ALSO A UNIQUE POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IN-VIOLENCE.- UNDERSTANDING THAT POPULATION IS KEY TO ANY SORT OF PEACE AGREEMENT.- THAT UNDERSTANDING LIES IN EXAMINING WHAT MOTIVATES BOTH SIDES OF THE CONFLICT.-THE BATTLE OVER LAND IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SOURCES OF CONFLICT IN HISTORY.- IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT IT PLAYS A ROLE IN THIS CONFLICT.- TO THE IRISH,-THEIR IDENTITY WAS ROOTED IN THE CHURCH AND THE LAND.- BRITISH IMPERIALISM SAW-THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAND LORDSHIP IN IRELAND.- PROTESTANT LANDLORDS RENTED-LAND TO CATHOLIC TENANTS, TURNING AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM INTO ONE WROUGHT WITH DEEP-RELIGIOUS ANIMOSITY.- THIS REPRESENTED NOT ONLY CONQUEST BUT RELIGIOUS-PERSECUTION TO THE IRISH. (HICKEY 1984)-THE FAMINE OF 1845-1849 WAS A SIGNIFICANT SET BACK IN ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS.- IT-REPRESENTED A FAILURE OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE FOR THE BASIC NEEDS-OF THE IRISH.- IT WAS ALSO SEEN BY SOME AS AN ATTEMPT TO PACIFY THE IRISH-THROUGH STARVATION.- THE RELIEF OFFERED TO CATHOLICS DURING THE FAMINE ALSO-FURTHERED THE DIVIDE BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS, AS IT WAS OFTEN OFFERED-ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY ATTEND A PROTESTANT CHURCH.-- IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR-TO IRISH CATHOLICS THAT THE ROOT OF THEIR HARDSHIP LAY WITH THE BRITISH AND-IRISH NATIONALISM GAINED MOMENTUM.----  ANOTHER ONE OF THE THEORIES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IS THAT THE CONFLICT IS-ROOTED IN ETHNIC OR CULTURAL DIFFERENCE.- THE OBVIOUS CRITIQUE TO THIS IDEA IS-THAT THE PROTESTANT AND THE CATHOLIC GROUPS HAVE ONE MAJOR THING IN COMMON- -THEY ARE ALL IRISH.- YET, THESE TWO GROUPS WOULD TEND TO DIFFER IN THAT BELIEF.-THE LABEL PROTESTANT HAS COME TO SIGNIFY THE IRISH OF THE NORTH THAT IDENTIFY-THEMSELVES WITH BRITISH TRADITION.- THEY PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN-AND FIGHT TO MAINTAIN TIES TO BRITAIN.- DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE LIKELY-BORN IN IRELAND, THEY TEND-TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH BEING BRITISH.- THEY ARE-ALSO REFERRED TO AS UNIONISTS, LOYALISTS OR ORANGEMEN.- ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT-ARE THE CATHOLICS.- THE POPULATION THAT FALLS UNDER THIS LABEL IS CONSIDERED-ETHNICALLY IRISH.- THEY FIGHT FOR A UNITED IRELAND, FREE FROM BRITISH RULE.- THEY ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN THE IRISH LANGUAGE OF GAELIC, AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE-FEW PLACES LEFT THAT USE IT PRE-DOMINANTLY, IT IS STILL TAUGHT IN ROMAN CATHOLIC-SCHOOLS.- THESE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS NATIONALISTS OR REPUBLICANS.-THE IRISH ARGUMENT THEN IS THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTLY `IRISH' CULTURE THAT IS-BEING STIFLED BY A `BRITISH' MAJORITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND.- THE TWO KEYS-ELEMENTS OF THE `IRISH' CULTURE THAT MAKE CO-EXISTENCE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE ARE THAT-IT IS ROOTED IN A NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY AND THAT CATHOLIC BELIEFS ARE INTERTWINED-WITH THAT IDEOLOGY.- THEIR BELIEF IS THAT HARMONY CAN ONLY EXIST WHEN ALL OF-IRELAND IS UNITED AND THE ASSIMILATION OF THE NON-IRISH IS COMPLETE.-THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS PLAN IS TWO-FOLD.- FIRSTLY, PROTESTANTS HAVE A-CULTURE WHICH THEY BELIEVE IN AND DEFEND AND DO NOT WISH TO SACRIFICE.- SECONDLY, NORTHERN IRELAND HAS EXISTED AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE FOR OVER- 80YEARS, AND HAS LIKELY DEVELOPED A KIND OF CULTURE THAT IS UNIQUE AND THAT MAY-NOT BLEND WELL WITH-THE CULTURE OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. ----RELIGION SEEMS TO BE THE ELEMENT THAT TIES MANY OF THE THEORIES ON THE CONFLICT-TOGETHER.- UNDER THE ABOVE PRETENSE, THE LABELS CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT ARE USED-TO CONVEY CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS.- YET RELIGION REMAINS AN INTEGRAL-PART OF ONES CULTURE.- IN THE BATTLE OVER LAND, RELIGION MAINTAINS ITS TIE-THROUGH THE BATTLE BETWEEN PROTESTANT LANDLORDS AND CATHOLIC TENANTS.- RELIGION-EVEN HAS POLITICAL LINKS, AS MANY NATIONALISTS, SUCH AS D.P. MORGAN, THE FOUNDER-OF THE LEADER NEWSPAPER, BELIEVE THAT THE TWO IDEAS ARE INSEPARABLE:----------  "WHEN WE LOOK OUT ON IRELAND WE SEE THAT THOSE WHO---- BELIEVE, OR MAY BE IMMEDIATELY INDUCED TO BELIEVE, IN---- IRELAND AS A NATION ARE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, CATHOLICS...-----IF A NON-CATHOLIC NATIONALIST IRISHMAN DOES NOT WISH TO---- LIVE-IN A CATHOLIC ATMOSPHERE LET HIM TURN ORANGEMAN." (HICKEY 1984)----------  IT IS IMPORTANT THEN TO LOOK SERIOUSLY AT THE ROLE THAT RELIGION PLAYS IN THE-CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND.----  THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE RELIGION DEBATE.- ONE THE ONE HAND, SOME BELIEVE THAT-THE LABELS PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC ARE JUST THAT - LABELS USED TO DEFINE TWO-WARRING FACTIONS OF THE CONFLICT IN THE ABSENCE OF A REAL ETHNIC DIVIDE.- GIVEN-THAT ONE CAN POINT TO IDEAS OF TERRITORIAL DISPUTE, NATIONALISM AND CULTURE AS-POTENTIAL SOURCES OF CONFLICT, IT IS EASY TO SEE WHERE THIS OPINION IS FORMED.-YET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY, THERE IS MERIT IN THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE ARE-DOGMATIC DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO RELIGIONS WHICH KEEP THE CONFLICT AT A-STALEMATE.- WHILE BOTH PROTESTANTISM AND CATHOLICISM ARE FORMS OF CHRISTIANITY,-THE BELIEFS SURROUNDING HOW SOCIETY SHOULD BE STRUCTURED CAN LEAD-TO POLITICAL-CONFLICT.----  CATHOLICISM IS A VERY CLOSELY KNIT RELIGION.- ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE-BELIEF IS IN THE EMPHASIS-PLACED ON PRAYER AND SACRAMENTS.- THE INDIVIDUAL WHO-ADMINISTERS THESE SACRAMENTS BECOMES OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE, WHICH RESULTS IN-THE CREATION OF THE PRIESTHOOD.- THIS SUGGESTS A-SOCIAL ORDER WHERE THE LEADERS-HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEMS OF A SOCIETY.----  PROTESTANTISM IN CONTRAST IS BASED MUCH MORE LOOSELY.--IT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL-FORMS OF CHRISTIANITY, INCLUDING ANGLICAN, PRESBYTERIAN, METHODIST, BAPTIST AND-THE CHURCH OF IRELAND.- THE APPEAL IS MUCH MORE DIRECT - ONE WHERE THE MINISTER-PREPARES PARISHIONERS TO MEET GOD DIRECTLY.-- THIS POSES A DIRECT THREAT TO THE-STRUCTURED ORGANIZATION OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH.- LIKEWISE, PROTESTANTS FEAR-THAT IF IRELAND IS UNITED, THEIR FAITH WILL BE CONSUMED BY CATHOLICISM.-ULTIMATELY, THE RESULT IS THAT THE RELIGIOUS DIVIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS IS-NOT MERELY IN SYMBOLIC MEMBERSHIP, BUT ALSO IN THE-INTERPRETATION OF THE-CHRISTIAN FAITH.- AS-INDICATED BY PROFESSOR JOHN HICKEY,--IT IS MORE A QUESTION-OF RELIGION INSPIRING POLITICS THAN OF POLITICS MAKING USE OF RELIGION." (HICKEY-1984) RELIGION IS OFTEN DOWNPLAYED AS A-CAUSE OF THE CONFLICT IN NORTHERN-IRELAND BECAUSE WESTERN PLURALISTIC SOCIETIES DO NOT PLACE AS MUCH EMPHASIS ON-THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION IN DAILY LIFE.----  THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES HOW DOES ONE FIND A SOLUTION TO A CONFLICT THAT-IS SO MULTIFACETED?- BELFAST CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST MORRIS FRAZER INDICATES-THAT WHAT NORTHERN IRELAND IS NOW FACED WITH IS "A GENERATION OF CHILDREN-WHO HAVE LIVED WITH FEAR, HAVE BEEN TAUGHT-TO HATE AND WHO NOW ASPIRE TO-KILL." (MORRISSEY AND SMYTH 2002).- HERE IN LIES THE STARTING POINT TO-RESOLUTION - EDUCATION.- IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT-A-PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS, AND TO MAKE POSITIVE-PROGRESS TOWARDS A BI-NATIONAL STATE, A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH MUST BE USED.----  THERE ARE A FEW KEY THINGS THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO-CONSIDERATION BY ALL-SIDES.- THE FIRST IS THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT NOW, NOR WILL IT EVER BE, A SUCCESSFUL-BARGAINING TOOL.- FURTHER TO THAT IS THE IDEA THAT A PEACE-AGREEMENT CANNOT END-AT THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT VIOLENCE.- PROGRESS MUST BE MADE TOWARDS A MODEL OF-POSITIVE PEACE.- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS, NEGOTIATIONS MUST CONSIDER THE-POSITIONS OF THE MINORITY - CATHOLICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND PROTESTANTS IN-IRELAND AS A WHOLE.- NO ONE GROUPS' RIGHTS CAN BE INFRINGED UPON.- THIS WOULD-LEAD ALMOST NATURALLY TO THE IDEA OF A BI-NATIONAL STATE.- COEXISTENCE IS THE-BEST CHANCE THAT IRELAND HAS AT UNIFICATION.- IT IS THE ONLY REAL WAY TO OBTAIN-POSITIVE PEACE AND A STABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.-----  PEACE PROCESS----  BOMBINGS, SHOOTINGS AND COUNTLESS OTHER ACTS.- WILL THE VIOLENCE EVER END?-WILL PEACE AND STABILITY EVER COME?-- THESE WERE THE QUESTIONS THAT-FOR MOST OF NORTHERN IRELANDS HISTORY BEST DESCRIBED PROSPECTS FOR A-SOLUTION. FOR GENERATIONS UNIONIST AND NATIONALIST COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN-SEPARATED AS WELL AS ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER, TURNING TO DEMONSTRATIONS-OF COMMUNITY STRENGTH-TO MEETING WITH EACH-OTHER IN NEGOTIATION AND-COOPERATION.- FOR THE MOST PART, THE EARLIEST ATTEMPTS AT PEACE ATTEMPTED-TO MAKE ONLY MECHANICAL POLITICAL SOLUTIONS.- THESE ONLY REINFORCED-THE ALREADY OPPOSING RELATIONSHIPS.- RELATIVE CALM FOLLOWED THE IRELAND-ACT OF 1949, WHICH CREATED THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IN THE SOUTH. BY THE-1950S, EVEN CATHOLICS IN THE NORTH, STILL SECURELY TETHERED TO BRITAIN,-SEEMED READY TO ACCEPT EQUALITY RATHER THAN PUSHING FOR SECURING A MORE-UNITED IRELAND, SCHOLARS NOTE. BUT-THAT CHANGED AFTER NORTHERN IRELAND'S-CATHOLICS ORGANIZED A LARGE DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING DISCRIMINATION-IN VOTING RIGHTS, HOUSING AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN------ A POLICE CRACKDOWN-FOLLOWED, SPARKING MONTHS OF VIOLENCE AND A REEMERGENCE-OF THE REPUBLICAN-MOVEMENT. THE SUBSEQUENT BLOODY RIOTS BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS-MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE TROUBLES, THE EUPHEMISM FOR THE PERIOD OF-VIOLENCE THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR YEARS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.----  BOTH THE IRISH REPUBLICAN AND BRITISH SIDES EXPERIENCED BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE-1980S THAT WOULD HELP TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR THE PEACE PROCESS.- THE-PROPAGANDA-CAMPAIGN AROUND THE HUNGER STRIKES STARTED THE SINN FEIN INVOLVEMENT-IN ELECTORAL POLITICS AND COMMUNITY ACTION.- IT WAS THIS EVENT THAT STARTED A-TRANSFORMATION.- THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF SINN FEIN'S ASCENDANCY OVER THE IRA.- THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS FROM A MILITARY STRATEGY-TO A-PRIMARILY POLITICAL ONE, AND A LOWERING MARGIN OF-VICTORY ON WHICH THE-REPUBLICAN OUTLOOK WAS FOCUSED, FROM THE ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE OF THE RIGHT OF THE-IRISH PEOPLE AS A WHOLE TO SELF-DETERMINATION TOWARDS ENSURING THAT THE-IMMEDIATE INTERESTS OF THEIR CORE BASE OF SUPPORT WERE-SUFFICIENTLY REPRESENTED-IN AND BY BRITISH STATE INSTITUTIONS.- THIS MOVE INTO PARTY POLITICS WOULD END-UP LEADING SINN FEIN TO END THEIR COMMITMENT TO NOT TAKE THEIR SEATS IN THE-DAIL, A COMMITMENT WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY PRINCIPLE FOR REPUBLICANS SINCE AS FAR-BACK AS THE 1920S.- IN TAKING THEIR SEATS IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT AND LATER IN-LOCAL COUNCILS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, SINN FEIN WAS EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZING-INSTITUTIONS SET UP UNDER PARTITION AND THUS IMPLICITLY RECOGNIZING THE-PARTITION OF THE COUNTRY ITSELF.----  WHEN REPUBLICANS DID ENGAGE IN A PEACE PROCESS CONTACTS LIKE NATIONALIST JOHN-HUME WERE TO BE IMPORTANT.- WITH THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM SECTIONS OF-IRISH-AMERICA THIS COOPERATION WITH 'CONSTITUTIONAL' NATIONALISM BECAME THE-PAN-NATIONALIST ALLIANCE.- THIS CONNECTION ACTED AS THE GO THROUGH WHICH-REPUBLICANS WERE ABLE TO EASE THEIR MOVEMENT FROM A CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TO-A PLACATORY ONE.- THE ROLE OF INTERMEDIARIES WAS TO BECOME VERY IMPORTANT IN THE-PEACE PROCESS.- DURING THE LATE 1980S CONTACTS WERE MADE AND A NETWORK OF-CONNECTIONS DEVELOPED.- BUT AT THIS STAGE THE CONTACTS WERE LARGELY SECRET AND-UNFRUITFUL, A REFLECTION OF BOTH THE PARIAH STATUS OF REPUBLICANS AND THE-DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR STANCE AND THAT OF-OTHER POLITICAL ACTORS-IT WAS NOT UNTIL THESE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WERE CHALLENGED, MOST CRUCIALLY IN-THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT OF 1985 AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN SEVERAL OTHER INITIATIVES-JOINTLY DETERMINED BY THE BRITISH AND-IRISH GOVERNMENTS, THAT THE MAIN PARTIES-BEGAN TO PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS TO CREATE A DEMOCRATIC PEACE.- THE SEARCH FOR-PEACE HAD ALWAYS BEEN OVERWHELMED BY THE VIOLENCE THAT REINFORCED SEPARATION.--THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S NEGOTIATION AND SIGNING OF THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT-WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IN 1985 MARKED-SOME DEVELOPMENTS-THAT WERE TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS. -THE AGREEMENT BROUGHT THE-BRITISH GOVERNMENT CLOSER WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.- THIS-WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT FOR MOVING AWAY FROM VIEWING NORTHERN IRELAND AS A PURELY-DOMESTIC MATTER FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.- THE-INTRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF-THE AGREEMENT WAS ACHIEVED AGAINST THE EXPRESS WISHES OF ULSTER UNIONISTS.- THIS-WAS AN INDICATION OF THE DECLINING POWER OF THE UNIONISTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.- UNLIKE THE POWER-SHARING ASSEMBLY OF----4, UNIONISTS FAILED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO-WRECK THE AGREEMENT.- SUCH A FAILURE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT-WAS PREPARED TO FACE DOWN UNIONIST OPPOSITION.----  THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS BEGAN IN APRIL 1993 WHEN JOHN HUME, LEADER OF THE-SDLP, AND GERRY ADAMS, LEADER OF SINN FEIN, MET TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF-NORTHERN IRELAND.- AN IDEA OF DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND WAS A-MAJOR PRIORITY.- AND THEY HOPED THESE DISCUSSIONS WOULD LEAD TO A HISTORICAL-AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS.- A KEY ELEMENT OF THIS-DISCUSSION WAS THAT BRITAIN SHOULD BE WILLING TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND TO-DECIDE THEIR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE.- THIS-MEANT THAT THEY HAD TO ACCEPT THE-POSSIBILITY OF A UNITED IRELAND.- FURTHERMORE, THEY WERE TO CALL ON BRITAIN TO-DECLARE IT HAD NO SELFISH, POLITICAL, STRATEGIC, OR ECONOMIC INTEREST IN-NORTHERN IRELAND.----  SF IN PAST YEARS HAD SHOWN SOME SIGNS THAT THEY WISHED TO PEACEFULLY AND-DEMOCRATICALLY REACH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND.- THROUGH THEIR-COMING TOGETHER, HUME AND ADAMS SIGNALED A CHANGE IN THE NATIONALISTS APPROACH-TO THE NORTHERN IRISH SITUATION WHICH-WOULD, EVENTUALLY, ENTAIL REPUBLICANS-BEING WILLING TO ABANDON VIOLENCE.- IN THIS APPROACH, NATIONALIST LEADERS HOPED-TO APPEAL TO A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONALIST-COMMUNITY AND TO THE-IRISH PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC.- VIOLENCE HAD REDUCED SUPPORT FOR THE NATIONALIST-CAUSE IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.- THE TASK OF SF WOULD BE TO CONVINCE THE IRA-THAT THEY COULD ACHIEVE THEIR POLITICAL AIMS WITHOUT THE USE OF PARAMILITARY-FORCE.----  THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN HUME AND ADAMS WOULD BE THE DRIVING FACTOR TO TALKS-BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS.- IN JUNE 1993 BOTH GOVERNMENTS CAME-TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF EACH GOVERNMENTS RELATIONSHIP TO NORTHERN-IRELAND.- FOR SIX MONTHS, BOTH GOVERNMENTS WOULD TRY TO REACH A COMPROMISE.- THE-MAIN DEBATE FOCUSED ON THE QUESTION OF SELF-DETERMINATION.- IN THE END THE-BRITISH GOVERNMENT COULD NOT ACCEPT SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND-AS A WHOLE.- ON 15 DECEMBER 1993 THE JOINT DECLARATION ON PEACE WAS RELEASED.- TO REPUBLICANS, THE DECLARATION WAS NOT SEEN AS A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT-BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES.- THE DOCUMENT CLAIMED TO CREATE A STRUCTURE IN-WHICH A PEACEFUL POLITICAL SETTLEMENT COULD COME ABOUT.----  BOTH BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS KNEW THAT NO DEMOCRATIC PROCESS COULD BE-INFLUENCED BY VIOLENCE.- IT WAS ALSO KNOWN THAT IF THE TALKS WERE TO PRODUCE ANY-LASTING SETTLEMENT THE PROCESS WOULD HAVE TO BE AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE. THE-ABSENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES THAT REPRESENTED THE VARIOUS PARAMILITARY GROUPS-WAS SEEN AS A DRAWBACK TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERMANENT SETTLEMENT. THEREFORE,-IT WAS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL THAT LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS-SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO ENTER INTO CEASE-FIRES.----  WHILE POLITICIANS HAD STRUCK A COMPROMISE, PARAMILITARY GROUPS HAD NOT.-REPUBLICANS SPENT SOME TIME SEEKING CLARIFICATION ON THE JOINT AGREEMENT. ONLY-WHEN THEY FELT THE AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW-THEM TO PURSUE THEIR-OBJECTIVES-POLITICALLY WOULD THEY CONSIDER A CEASE-FIRE. LOYALIST VIOLENCE WAS A RESPONSE-TO REPUBLICAN VIOLENCE, BUT IT WAS ALSO A SIGN OF THEIR INSECURITY REGARDING-THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.-ALTHOUGH UNIONISTS WERE IN THE-MAJORITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE DOCUMENT WOULD ONLY ALLOW A UNITED IRELAND-TO BE ACHIEVED BY MAJORITY CONSENT-FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND POPULATION,-UNIONISTS NO LONGER-FELT THEY HELP THE POWER.----  THE SF PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE PROCESS THAT EVENTUALLY WAS TO BRING ABOUT-AN IRA CEASE-FIRE.- SF WAS CONVINCED THAT THE IRA'S OBJECTIVES COULD BE ACHIEVED-BETTER THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS.--THE SF ARGUMENT CLEARLY INFLUENCED THE LEADERS-OF THE IRA. ON 31 AUGUST 1994 THE IRA ANNOUNCED THEIR CEASE-FIRE.- THOUGH IT WAS-A VICTORY FOR PEACE, IT WAS NOT AN ALL-INCLUSIVE REPUBLICAN CEASE-FIRE.- THERE-WERE OTHER LESS KNOWN GROUPS SUCH AS THE IRISH NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY AND-REPUBLICAN SINN FEIN THAT DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES BOUND BY THE IRA'S-CEASE-FIRE.- A LONG AND VIOLENT SIX WEEKS HAD PAST BEFORE THE CLMC ANNOUNCED A-CEASE-FIRE OF THEIR OWN.----  IN 1995 BOTH GOVERNMENTS INTRODUCED A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR AGREEMENT. PEACE IN-NORTHERN IRELAND HELPED THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS FIND A NEW CONFIDENCE-IN THEIR DIALOGUE. NOT ONLY WAS THE DOCUMENT A CONTINUATION OF ISSUES DISCUSSED-IN THE JOINT DECLARATION FOR PEACE, IT ALSO INTRODUCED NEW IDEAS FOR FUTURE-GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES.- NOT EVERYBODY IN THE NATIONALIST COMMUNITY REJECTED-THE FRAMEWORK.- SOME BELIEVED THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE COMMON-GOOD, THE PROPOSED STRUCTURES HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT BOTH COMMUNITIES-ECONOMICALLY.- HOWEVER, THE UNIONISTS DID NOT SEE IT IN THE SAME WAY.- THEY FELT-THREATENED AND BETRAYED BY THE DOCUMENT, PARTICULARLY BY THE PROPOSED-NORTH/SOUTH STRUCTURES.- IN THEIR OPINION, A NORTH/SOUTH INSTITUTION WITH ANY-KIND OF POLITICAL POWER WAS A SURE SIGN OF A STEP TOWARDS IRISH UNITY.-THE DECOMMISSIONING OF PARAMILITARY ARMS BECAME AN-IMPORTANT ISSUE AS NORTHERN-IRELAND MOVED TOWARDS MULTI-PARTY TALKS.- IT BECAME APPARENT THAT SOME OF THE-PARTICIPANTS WOULD ONLY ACCEPT THOSE PARTIES, WHO WERE LINKED TO PARAMILITARY-ORGANIZATIONS, INTO A TALK'S PROCESS IF WEAPONS WERE FIRST HANDED OVER.--OPPOSING PARTIES SAW-THIS NOT ONLY AS UNREALISTIC BUT ALSO AS AN UNFAIR-PRECONDITION ON THE ENTRY TO TALKS.- DESPITE THE MITCHELL REPORT, THE BRITISH-DECIDED A SEPARATE-COMMITTEE SHOULD BE FORMED ON THE QUESTION OF DECOMMISSIONS.- THIS DIDN'T GO OVER WELL WITH SINN FEIN OR THE IRA.- ON FEBRUARY 9TH, THE IRA-ENDED THEIR CEASE-FIRE.--THE PROCESS WAS TO GO ON.----  TALKS OPENED JUNE-------THE UDP AND PUP WERE-ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN TALKS-BECAUSE-THE CLMC CEASE-FIRE HAD HELD UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.- AS EXPECTED, SF WAS-NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER THE TALKS BECAUSE THE IRA HAD NOT RESUMED ITS CEASE-FIRE-BEFORE THE TALKS BEGAN.- IT WOULD STAY WITHOUT SINN FEIN AND-BE OVERSHADOWED BY-IRA VIOLENCE MOST OF THE TIME.- AS SEPTEMBER 1997 GREW CLOSER, AND SF RECOGNIZED-THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE TALKS OR ELSE PROCEED-WITHOUT THEM, THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT REASSESSED ITS POLITICAL SITUATION.- JOHN-HUME ARGUED THAT A RESUMPTION OF THE CEASE-FIRE WAS ONCE AGAIN WITHIN REACH OF-THE GOVERNMENT.- ON JULY 18TH HUME AND ADAMS RELEASED A JOINT STATEMENT THAT-SAID LASTING COMMITMENT WOULD ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF IT IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF-DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY AND HAS THE ALLEGIANCE OF BOTH TRADITIONS.-- TWO DAYS-LATER, THE IRA RESUMED ITS CEASE-FIRE.- BOTH GOVERNMENTS REACTED WITH RESERVED-HOPE AND-WAITED TO SEE IF THE-CEASE-FIRE WAS GENUINE. IF IT WERE CLEAR THE IRA-HAD ABANDONED ALL PARAMILITARY ACTIVITY FOR SIX WEEKS, THEN SF WOULD BE ALLOWED-TO ENTER THE TALKS IN SEPTEMBER. THE CEASE-FIRE HELD,-SF WAS ADMITTED INTO-THE-TALKS, AND NOT SURPRISINGLY, THEIR ARRIVAL MARKED THE DEPARTURE OF THE DUP AND-UKUP. AFTER A SINCERE-EFFORT BY BOTH-GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THE MULTI-PARTY TALKS-ALL INCLUSIVE, THE TALKS STILL LACKED REPRESENTATION FROM ALL PARTIES.-VIOLENCE HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON MULTI-PARTY TALKS AS THE EARLY MONTHS OF- 1998BROUGHT THE SUSPENSION OF TWO PARTIES FROM THE PROCESS.- THE UDP AND SF, AFTER-BOTH GOVERNMENTS CONCLUDED THAT THEY HAD BREACHED THE MITCHELL PRINCIPLES. THE-UDP IS CONSIDERED AS THE POLITICAL WING-OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUP THE UDA / UFF-WHICH HAD BEEN LINKED TO MANY KILLINGS.- IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD BE-ALLOWED BACK INTO THE-TALKS AFTER A PERIOD OF-TIME IF THEY REMAINED COMMITTED TO-THE MITCHELL PRINCIPLES. IN LATE FEBRUARY 1998, SF WAS ALSO SUSPENDED FROM THE-TALKS.- BOTH GOVERNMENTS BELIEVED THOSE TWO KILLINGS, THAT OF A LOYALIST-PARAMILITARY AND A CATHOLIC DRUG DEALER, WAS THE WORK OF THE IRA. AS THE TALKS-WERE NEARING THE MAY 1998 DEADLINE, THE TWO GOVERNMENTS SET AN EXCLUSION OF TWO-WEEKS PROVIDED THERE WERE NO FURTHER BREACHES OF THE MITCHELL PRINCIPLES. A-LITTLE LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER THE UDP WALKED OUT OF THE TALKS, THEY REJOINED-THEM ON 23 FEBRUARY------ DESPITE UNIONIST CLAIMS THAT THE IRA WAS LINKED TO-RECENT BOMBINGS, SF ALSO WERE ALLOWED BACK IN THE TALKS ON 23 MARCH 1998.-IN AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME THE POLITICAL GRIDLOCK, THE INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN OF THE-MULTI-PARTY TALKS SET A DEADLINE FOR AGREEMENT AS THE 9 APRIL------- THE-DEADLINE DID GIVE THE PROCESS A-NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AND HAD BEEN A GOOD IDEA.- DURING THE LAST WEEK OF MARCH AND THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL SERIOUS PROBLEMS STILL-LAY IN THE PATH OF A-POLITICAL.- NOT SURPRISINGLY, UNIONISTS-AND NATIONALISTS-WERE DIVIDED OVER HOW POWER WOULD BE SHARED IN THE PROPOSED NORTHERN IRELAND-ASSEMBLY, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE INFLUENCE OVER-NORTHERN IRELAND UNDER THE PROPOSED NORTH-SOUTH STRUCTURES.---  IN RETROSPECT, THE TENSIONS THAT WERE APPARENT BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GROUPINGS-WERE AN INDICATION OF THE HISTORICAL COMPROMISE THAT WAS BEING ASKED OF ALL-SIDES. THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE, OF 9 APRIL 1998, WAS NOT ACHIEVED BUT PARTIES AND-GOVERNMENTS STAYED AT THE STORMONT CASTLE UNTIL AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED. THE-IMMINENT ARRIVAL OF THE EASTER WEEKEND, AND THE PROSPECT OF A COLLAPSE OF THE-TALKS, GAVE THE PROCESS AND PARTICIPANTS A LAST PUSH.-- THE NEWS OF THE-AGREEMENT WAS REPORTED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON ON GOOD FRIDAY. AMAZINGLY ALL THE-PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE TALKS ATTENDED THE FINAL SESSION IN WHICH GEORGE-MITCHELL ANNOUNCED THAT AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED AND THAT THE MULTI-PARTY-TALKS WERE AT END.- THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS WERE CAREFUL NOT TO CLAIM IT-AS A VICTORY FOR ANY PARTICULAR PARTY, BUT RATHER AS THE BEST AGREEMENT THAT-COULD BE ACHIEVED IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.----  IS THIS A COMPLICATED PROCESS?- IT MOST DEFINITELY IS, BUT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE.-SOME PEOPLE FEARED THAT THESE EVENTS WOULD DERAIL THE PEACE PROCESS. OTHERS WERE-DETERMINED NOT TO LET THAT HAPPEN. AFTER THE 1998 OMAGH BOMBING INCIDENT, A-SPOKESMAN FOR BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR SAID, WHAT THE LAST FEW DAYS-ACTUALLY HAVE SHOWN IS THAT THE AGREEMENT AND THE PEACE PROCESS HAVE SURVIVED-AND HAVE EMERGED STRENGTHENED FROM THE PROCESS.------  IT IS UNCLEAR YET WHETHER THIS SENTIMENT IS TRUE, OR IS MERELY WISHFUL THINKING.-IN THE PAST, THERE HAVE BEEN AGREEMENTS REACHED THAT SUBSEQUENTLY FELL APART.-WILL THIS ONE BE DIFFERENT? MAINTAINING THIS AGREEMENT WILL REQUIRE TREMENDOUS-WILLPOWER ON BOTH SIDES. PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY RESOLVED DISPUTES THROUGH-THE USE OF GUNS AND BOMBS WILL HAVE TO LEARN THE ART OF COMPROMISE. ON THE DAY-THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED, PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID:-----  "ALL FRIENDS OF IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND KNOW THE TASK OF MAKING THE PEACE-ENDURE WILL BE DIFFICULT. THE PATH OF PEACE IS NEVER EASY. BUT THE PARTIES HAVE-MADE BRAVE DECISIONS. THEY HAVE CHOSEN HOPE OVER HATE, THE PROMISE OF THE FUTURE-OVER THE POISON OF THE PAST. AND IN SO DOING, ALREADY THEY HAVE WRITTEN A NEW-CHAPTER IN THE RICH HISTORY OF THEIR ISLAND -- A CHAPTER OF RESOLUTE COURAGE-THAT INSPIRES US ALL.-----"  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE READY TO UNDERTAKE THIS CHALLENGE-IN RETURN FOR A PEACEFUL EXISTENCE. WILL THEIR LEADERS BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEIR-WISHES? ONLY TIME WILL TELL.-----  BIBLIOGRAPHY-----  BREWER, JOHN D. AND GARETH I.
