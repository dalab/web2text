----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STATEMENT OF STUART K. PRATT, CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION----------  THE CONSUMER DATA- INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (CDIA) IS PLEASED TO-SUBMIT WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN CONNECTION -WITH A HEARING ON THE MISUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS-AND WE THANK CHAIRMAN- SHAW FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING.- CDIA HAS APPEARED IN PERSON BEFORE THIS- SUBCOMMITTEE BEFORE AND WE HOPE OUR TESTIMONY WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU.-------------------------------------------------[1]  FOUNDED IN 1906,- THE CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (CDIA), FORMERLY KNOWN AS ASSOCIATED- CREDIT BUREAUS, IS THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS MORE THAN---00 CONSUMER DATA-COMPANIES.--CDIA MEMBERS REPRESENT THE-NATION-S LEADING- INSTITUTIONS IN CREDIT REPORTING, MORTGAGE REPORTING, CHECK VERIFICATION, FRAUD -PREVENTION, RISK MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYMENT REPORTING, TENANT SCREENING AND- COLLECTION SERVICES.---------  CONSUMER REPORTING- AGENCIES ARE CAREFUL STEWARDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THEY ADHERE TO STRICT- PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS.---------------------------------------------[2] THE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CONSUMER REPORTING SYSTEM IS THE BACKBONE- OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT ECONOMY.----------------------------------------------------[3]  OUR MEMBERS HAVE A- STRONG INTEREST IN THE LEGITIMATE AND LAWFUL USE OF ALL-INFORMATION, INCLUDING- SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS.- USED PROPERLY,-SSNS PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN--REDUCING FRAUD, ENHANCING WORKPLACE SECURITY, PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY,--SUPPORTING-HOMELAND DEFENSE, REDUCING STATE AND FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT FRAUD,- ENHANCING CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, AND FACILITATING COMMERCE-TO A DIVERSE,- MOBILE ELECTRONIC SOCIETY.---------  BEFORE I- SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HOW THE SSN IS USED BY OUR INDUSTRY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF- THIS NUMBER, I HAVE FOUND IT HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A SHORT REVIEW OF WHAT A- CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY IS, WHAT IS CONTAINED IN A CONSUMER REPORT, AND THE- LAW THAT GOVERNS-OUR INDUSTRY.----------  CONSUMER- REPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS-----------  CONSUMER REPORTING- AGENCIES MAINTAIN INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER PAYMENT PATTERNS ASSOCIATED- WITH VARIOUS-TYPES OF CREDIT OBLIGATIONS ON APPROXIMATELY 190 MILLION- AMERICANS.- THE DATA COMPILED BY THESE-AGENCIES IS-USED BY CREDITORS AND OTHERS- PERMITTED-UNDER THE STRICT PRESCRIPTIONS OF THE FCRA.-------  CONSUMER CREDIT- HISTORIES ARE DERIVED FROM, AMONG OTHER SOURCES, THE VOLUNTARY PROVISION OF- INFORMATION ABOUT CONSUMER PAYMENTS ON VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT ACCOUNTS OR OTHER- DEBTS FROM THOUSANDS OF DATA FURNISHERS SUCH AS CREDIT GRANTORS, STUDENT-LOAN- GUARANTEE AND CHILD-SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. A CONSUMER'S FILE MAY ALSO- INCLUDE PUBLIC RECORD ITEMS SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY FILING, JUDGMENT OR LIEN.- NOTE- THAT THESE TYPES OF DATA SOURCES OFTEN CONTAIN SSNS, AS WELL.-------  FOR PURPOSES OF- DATA ACCURACY AND PROPER IDENTIFICATION, GENERALLY OUR MEMBERS MAINTAIN- INFORMATION SUCH AS A CONSUMER'S FULL NAME, CURRENT AND PREVIOUS ADDRESSES,- SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (WHEN VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED BY CONSUMERS) AND PLACES OF- EMPLOYMENT. THIS DATA IS LOADED INTO THE SYSTEM ON A REGULAR BASIS-TO ENSURE THE- COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF DATA.--------------------------------------------------[4]  IT IS INTERESTING- TO NOTE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF DATA IN OUR MEMBERS' SYSTEMS SIMPLY CONFIRMS- WHAT MOST OF YOU WOULD EXPECT; THAT CONSUMERS PAY THEIR BILLS ON TIME AND ARE- RESPONSIBLE, GOOD CREDIT RISKS. THIS CONTRASTS-WITH THE MAJORITY OF SYSTEMS- MAINTAINED IN-OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS JAPAN OR ITALY, WHICH STORE ONLY NEGATIVE- DATA AND DO NOT GIVE CONSUMERS RECOGNITION FOR THE RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF- THEIR FINANCES.--------  AS IMPORTANT AS- KNOWING WHAT WE-HAVE IN OUR FILES IS ALSO KNOWING WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION OUR- MEMBERS--- DO NOT---- MAINTAIN IN FILES USED TO PRODUCE CONSUMER REPORTS. OUR--MEMBERS DO NOT KNOW--- WHAT---- CONSUMERS HAVE PURCHASED USING CREDIT (E.G., A- REFRIGERATOR, CLOTHING, ETC.) OR--- WHERE---- THEY USED A PARTICULAR BANK CARD- (E.G., WHICH STORES A CONSUMER FREQUENTS). THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE A RECORD OF---- WHEN---- CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN DECLINED FOR CREDIT OR ANOTHER BENEFIT BASED ON THE- USE OF A CONSUMER REPORT. MEDICAL TREATMENT DATA ISN'T A PART OF THE DATABASES- AND NO BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN A CONSUMER REPORT.-----------  THE FAIR CREDIT- REPORTING ACT (FCRA)-----------  IN ADDITION TO OUR GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE INDUSTRY, WE BELIEVE IT IS--IMPORTANT FOR YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE TO HAVE A BASELINE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW- WHICH REGULATES OUR INDUSTRY.-------  ENACTED IN 1970,- THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED IN THE 104TH CONGRESS- WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE CREDIT REPORTING REFORM ACT.-------  CONGRESS, OUR- ASSOCIATION'S MEMBERS, CREDITORS AND CONSUMER GROUPS SPENT OVER SIX YEARS- WORKING THROUGH THE MODERNIZATION OF WHAT WAS THE FIRST PRIVACY LAW ENACTED IN- THIS COUNTRY (---0). THIS AMENDATORY PROCESS RESULTED IN A COMPLETE, CURRENT AND- FORWARDING-LOOKING STATUTE. THE FCRA SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFULLY- BALANCING THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF MAINTAINING- A COMPETITIVE CONSUMER REPORTING SYSTEM SO NECESSARY TO A MARKET-ORIENTED- ECONOMY.-------  THE FCRA IS AN- EFFECTIVE PRIVACY STATUTE, WHICH PROTECTS THE CONSUMER BY NARROWLY LIMITING THE- APPROPRIATE USES OF A CONSUMER REPORT (OFTEN WE CALL THIS A CREDIT REPORT) UNDER- SECTION 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681B), ENTITLED- PERMISSIBLE PURPOSES OF REPORTS.--------  SOME OF THE MORE- COMMON USES OF A CONSUMER'S FILE ARE IN THE ISSUANCE-OF CREDIT, SUBSEQUENT- ACCOUNT REVIEW AND COLLECTION PROCESSES. REPORTS ARE ALSO, FOR EXAMPLE,- PERMITTED TO BE USED BY CHILD SUPPORT-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHEN ESTABLISHING- LEVELS OF SUPPORT.--------  BEYOND PROTECTING- THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER REPORTS, THE FCRA ALSO- PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS SUCH-AS THE RIGHT OF ACCESS; THE RIGHT TO- DISPUTE ANY INACCURATE INFORMATION AND HAVE IT CORRECTED OR REMOVED; AND THE- RIGHT TO PROSECUTE ANY PERSON WHO ACCESSES THEIR INFORMATION FOR AN- IMPERMISSIBLE PURPOSE.- THE LAW ALSO INCLUDES A SHARED LIABILITY FOR DATA- ACCURACY BETWEEN CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO- THE SYSTEM.-----------  SOCIAL SECURITY- NUMBER USES-----------  LET ME NOW TURN TO- THE QUESTION OF HOW OUR INDUSTRY USES THE SSN.-------  UNDER THE FAIR- CREDIT REPORTING-ACT, OUR INDUSTRY HAS A DUTY TO-- EMPLOY REASONABLE PROCEDURES--TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ACCURACY-- OF THE CONSUMER REPORT.- FURTHER, WE- MUST DESIGN SYSTEMS THAT ACCURATELY ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO EXTRACT--- ONLY----- THE DATA REQUESTED ON A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.-------  WE MUST ACCOMPLISH- THIS DUAL MISSION OF ACCURACY BOTH IN TERMS OF BUILDING DATABASES, BUT ALSO- PROPERLY IDENTIFYING FILES IN-OUR SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF A HIGHLY MOBILE- SOCIETY.- CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:--------------  APPROXIMATELY 16% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION MOVES--EACH YEAR ACCORDING TO-THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, WHICH MEANS MANY ADDRESSES CHANGE- EACH YEAR.- (THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY 42 MILLION AMERICANS)----------  BASED ON NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS, IT- IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE 2.4 MILLION MARRIAGES AND 1.2 MILLION DIVORCES- ANNUALLY.- THIS EVENT FREQUENTLY TRIGGERS CHANGES-IN ADDRESSES AS WELL AS LAST- NAMES.----------  IN 1998 THERE WERE 6 MILLION HOMES IN THE U.S. THAT ARE CONSIDERED--- VACATION OR SECOND HOMES.- CONSUMERS OFTEN SWITCH BILLING ADDRESSES IF--- THEY STAY AT SUCH RESIDENCES FOR LONG PERIODS OF-TIME AND IN SOME CASES--- MAINTAIN-BILLING ADDRESSES FOR BOTH RESIDENCES WITH VARIOUS CREDITORS.---- (SOURCE: U.S. CENSUS BUREAU HOUSE VACANCY SURVEY AS EXTRAPOLATED BY THE--- NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS)--------------  THESE DATA CLEARLY- SPEAK TO THE CHALLENGE OUR MEMBERS FACE WHERE IDENTIFYING DATA OFTEN CHANGES.---------  IN LIGHT OF THE- MOBILITY OF OUR SOCIETY, THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PLAYS A VERY SIGNIFICANT- ROLE IN ENSURING DATA QUALITY.- OUR MEMBERS PROCESS 2 BILLION DATA ELEMENTS A- MONTH.- THESE ELEMENTS ARE A COMBINATION OF CREDIT HISTORY DATA AND IDENTIFYING- INFORMATION.- CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING VERY REAL EXAMPLE.---------  WHERE A CONSUMER- HAS CHANGED A LAST NAME DUE TO MARRIAGE OR DIVORCE AND HAS MOVED TO A NEW- ADDRESS, WHICH IS COMMON IN EITHER CASE, THE SSN IS THE MOST STABLE IDENTIFYING- ELEMENT IN THE FILE.- FIRST, IT HELPS US TO IDENTIFY THE CONSUMER'S FILE WITH- PRECISION DURING THIS LIFE TRANSITION WHERE HE OR SHE IS LIKELY APPLYING FOR NEW- CREDIT, SEEKING APPROVAL FOR UTILITIES, AND SEEKING TO RENT OR PURCHASE A NEW- RESIDENCE.-- THE CONSUMER EXPECTS THAT THE CONSUMER REPORT-WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR- ALL OF THESE-NECESSARY TRANSACTIONS AND THE SSN HELPS OUR-MEMBERS TO MEET THIS- EXPECTATION.- SECOND, THE CONSUMER EXPECT-HIS OR HER-FILE TO BE ACCURATE AND THE- SSN HELPS US TO MAINTAIN THE FILE ACCURATELY EVEN WHEN THE-CONSUMER IS IN THE- MIDST OF UPDATING CREDITORS WITH CHANGES IN NAME AND ADDRESS.------  THE SSN IS ALSO A- CRITICAL ELEMENT IN PRODUCING INFORMATION PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE COMMONLY-CALLED- LOCATOR SERVICES.--THESE SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO CHILD- SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR PURPOSES OF LOCATING-NON-CUSTODIAL PARENTS;--------------------------------------------[5] TO-PENSION FUNDS WHICH MUST LOCATE-BENEFICIARIES; TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR- LOCATING CRIMINALS-OR WITNESSES;--------------------------------------------[6] TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT MUST LOCATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO PAY- THEIR BILLS, TO STATE BENEFITS AGENCIES TO REDUCE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FRAUD,--------------------------------------------[7] AND FOR OTHER SIMILAR USES.-----------FURTHER, THE SSN- PLAYS A-ROLE IN FRAUD PREVENT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ION AND IDENTITY THEFT-----------  IN YOUR PRESS- RELEASE ANNOUNCING THIS HEARING,-YOU MENTION THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE OF THE SSN.-- OUR INDUSTRY HAS A HISTORY OF BRINGING FORWARD INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS FRAUD.-- THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND BETTER PROCEDURES AND- EDUCATION.- CDIA AND ITS MEMBERS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BEING LEADING INNOVATORS- OF IDENTITY FRAUD SOLUTIONS.- THE ATTACHMENT PROVIDES A SHORT THUMBNAIL OF OUR- INVOLVEMENT IN IDENTITY FRAUD REMEDIATION SINCE 1993.-------------------------------------------------------[8]  CONCLUSION-----------  IN CONCLUSION, YOU- CAN SEE BY OUR ACTIONS THAT IN LARGE PART OUR USES OF THE SSN ARE GOVERNED UNDER- THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT, ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE PRIVACY LAWS IN THE- COUNTRY.- BEYOND LAW, OUR MEMBERS HAVE A HISTORY OF PROACTIVELY LIMITING HOW- SSNS ARE USED OUTSIDE OF THE FCRA.- NO ONE PARTICULAR ELEMENT OF INFORMATION IS- THE KEY TO IDENTITY THEFT.- THE UNDERLYING THEME IN ALL OF THIS IS BALANCE.--------  LAWS THAT- OVERREACH IN ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT USE OF THE SSN ARE LIKELY TO MERELY TAKE FRAUD- PREVENTION TOOLS OUT OF THE HANDS OF LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES AT THE EXPENSE OF- CONSUMERS.- IRONICALLY, TO PREVENT FRAUD YOU MUST BE ABLE TO CROSSCHECK- INFORMATION.- TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE DATABASES, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A- RANGE OF IDENTIFYING ELEMENTS.- ABSENT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SSN, WE WILL BE- LESS ABLE TO BUILD ACCURATE DATA BASES, TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY RECORDS AND TO- HELP PREVENT THE VERY CRIME THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRAUD PREVENTION AND- AUTHENTICATION TOOLS.---------  THANK YOU FOR THIS- OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER TESTIMONY.- CDIA IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST YOUR AND YOUR- COMMITTEE AT ANY TIME.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   [1] PREVENTING IDENTITY THEFT----- BY TERRORISTS: HEARING BEFORE THE HOUSE COMM.
