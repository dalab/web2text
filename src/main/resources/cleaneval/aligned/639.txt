IT'S A CURIOUS FACT THAT I WOULDN'T SAY I LIKE---- PORING OVER BOOKS, BUT DESPITE THIS-I FOUND MYSELF SO GREATLY INTENT WITH IT. I'M AFRAID I ----CANNOT HOPE TO CONVEY TO YOU-A CORRECT FEELING THAT AFFECTED ME ON READING THIS BOOKLET.---- FOR ONE THING IT LEFT AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND AND IT DID GIVE ME FOOD FOR---- CONTEMPLATION AND PUT ME IN A MOOD OF REFLECTIONS.----------- AFTER HAVING READ IT SEVERAL TIMES THE INCLINATION TO FIGURE OUT-MORE WAS AWAKENED. I---- THINK THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A THING PROPERLY INTO ONE'S UNDERSTANDING WITHOUT---- COMPREHENDING IT. THEREFORE REFERRING-TO THE MENTION OF OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING PEACE---- PILGRIM BOOK, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT SENT TO MY ADDRESS.-I MAKE SURE I-CAN UNDERSTAND---- ENGLISH THERE'S NO DIFFICULTY IN READING IT IN ORIGINAL.

I AM---- READING THE PEACE PILGRIM BOOK. BY THE TIME I HAD READ UP TO PAGE 45 I HAD TO STOP AND---- WRITE MY WIFE AND TELL HER ABOUT THE BOOK.

HIS HEALTH WAS SUFFERING, AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ENERGY---- FOR ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SHARING WHAT HE WAS LEARNING ABOUT INNER PEACE WITH THE OTHER-----PRISONERS.------------AFTER RECEIVING HIS LETTER EXPLAINING THIS SITUATION, I WAS GIVEN AN INSPIRATION; IT---- SEEMED SO RIGHT AND LOVELY THAT I SENT THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL TO HIM: IF YOU WILL CUT OUT---- BACK YOUR----- "WORK-----" HOURS, I WILL PAY YOU DOUBLE WHAT YOU ARE EARNING (----30 CENTS/HOUR - BIG DEAL!) TO ORGANIZE AND LEAD A PEACE PILGRIM STUDY GROUP THERE. THREE---- NIGHTS A WEEK, THREE HOURS EACH NIGHT, FOR TEN WEEKS WILL EARN YOU $27, ENOUGH FOR THE---- GIFT YOU WANT TO BUY.----------- TO SWEETEN THE OFFER A BIT, I ALSO OFFERED TO SEND AN EQUAL AMOUNT TO THE PEACE PILGRIM---- CENTER TO HELP PAY FOR ANY MATERIALS THEY SENT HIM FOR THE STUDY GROUP. I KEPT HIS ACCRUED--------- "SALARY-----" AND ORDERED VARIOUS MAIL ORDER CATALOGUES TO BE SENT TO HIM WHEN HE---- DECIDED ON THE TOY HE WANTED FOR HIS DAUGHTER. I ORDERED AND PAID FOR-IT WITH HIS--------- "EARNINGS-----" FROM OUR AGREEMENT, BYPASSING THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE PRISON SYSTEM---- AND ASSURING HIS DAUGHTER RECEIVED HER GIFT FROM DADDY ON TIME.----------- I WILL NEVER KNOW WHOSE HEARTS WERE TOUCHED BY LEARNING ABOUT PEACE PILGRIM IN THIS---- WAY, BUT IT SURE MADE ME FEEL GOOD! IT IS RARE IN MY LIFE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SUCH A---- MEANINGFUL GIFT FOR SO LITTLE EXPENDITURE. AND I HAD THE ADDED BLESSING OF KNOWING THAT MY---- FRIEND, WHOSE HEALTH WAS NOT THE GREATEST, WAS WORKING LESS AND OPENING HIMSELF MORE TO---- PEACE'S LIFE AND WORDS THROUGH SHARING THEM WITH OTHERS.----------- FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, YOU CAN WRITE TO MY FRIEND DIRECTLY: CHRIS DEWALT, NO.---- 35662, UNIT 02, P.O DRAWER 1328, LOS LUNAS, NM---------------------------------------- 87031-XXXXX---------------------------- ILLINOIS--------- - I KEEP PEACE PILGRIM AT MY BEDSIDE AS A READY SOURCE OF---- INSPIRATION.------------------------- PRISONER--------- - HI, I'VE GOTTEN HOLD OF THE PEACE BOOKLET AND IT IS STARTING---- TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

UNIVERSITY FOR PEACE, COSTA---- RICA, SUGGESTED PLACING A STATUE OF PEACE PILGRIM NEAR THAT OF MAHATMA GANDHI. WE WERE---- THRILLED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY, BUT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND---- TIME-CONSUMING FOR US.----------- WE ARE THANKFUL THAT SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE CREATED A COMMITTEE,----- "FRIENDS OF FRIENDS---- OF PEACE PILGRIM-----" TO HELP US SPREAD HER MESSAGE. MARY NEWSWANGER, A MEMBER OF THIS---- COMMITTEE, IS A QUAKER PACIFIST LIVING IN MONTEVERDE, COSTA RICA. SHE FOUND A WELL-KNOWN---- COSTA RICAN SCULPTOR WHO WILL CREATE A STATUE OF HER WALKING, FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT.---- MARY HAS SPREAD PEACE PILGRIM'S MESSAGE BEFORE. TWELVE YEARS AGO, AS SECRETARY OF THE---- WIDER QUAKER FELLOWSHIP IN PHILADELPHIA, SHE RECOMMENDED INCLUDING STEPS BOOKLETS IN A---- MAILING TO 3000 PEOPLE IN 80 COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE MANY RESULTS - A PEACE PILGRIM CENTRE---- IN MOSCOW AND PEACE PILGRIM---- & STEPS BOOKLET IN RUSSIAN. IT WILL BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A---- STATUE OF PEACE PILGRIM IN COSTA RICA, ALONG WITH OTHER OUTSTANDING PEACE ADVOCATES.------------------- VISIONS OF THE STATUE'S INFLUENCE--------- - THE DEDICATION OF THE PEACE---- PILGRIM STATUE IS EXPECTED TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT OF STATURE TO DRAW THE ATTENTION---- OF THE WORLD TO THIS TIMELY MESSAGE FOR WORLD PEACE. COSTA RICA, THE FIRST COUNTRY WITHOUT---- AN ARMY, IS IN AN UNIQUE POSITION TO HOST SUCH AN EVENT.----------- OUR SCULPTOR HAD THE BEAUTIFUL IDEA OF THE STATUE BEING LEVEL WITH THE GROUND, NOT UPON---- A PEDESTAL. THIS WILL CREATE THE FEELING OF HAVING HER AMONG THE PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND---- HER, WITHOUT A SENSE OF DISTANCE. HE ALSO SUGGESTED HAVING A LEVEL STONE-LIKE FLOOR WITH---- THE WORDS OF HER MISSION,----- "THIS IS THE WAY OF PEACE: OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD,---- FALSEHOOD WITH TRUTH AND HATRED WITH LOVE-----" WRITTEN IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH.----------- THE GROUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY ARE BEAUTIFUL. PERHAPS AN INVITING SPACE CAN BE CREATED---- FOR THIS STATUE, A QUIET PLACE TO WITHDRAW, TO REFLECT BY ONESELF.----------- A SIGN COULD BE PLACED NEARBY DIRECTING VISITORS TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THEY MAY READ THE---- PEACE PILGRIM BOOK AND SEE A PEACE PILGRIM VIDEO, INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTARY. WE WILL HAVE---- BOOKS, STEPS, AUDIO AND VIDEO TAPES FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE. OUR ADDRESS IS ON ALL OUR---- MATERIALS.---------------------------------- XXXXX---------------------------- ARCHDIOCESE OF GUWAHATI, INDIA--------- - WE HAVE GONE THROUGH-YOUR STEPS-----BOOKLET AND PEACE PILGRIM BOOK AND FOUND THEM VERY USEFUL. WE ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN---- HAVING COPIES OF THESE BOOKS...WE WILL PRAY FOR THE SUCCESS OF YOUR EFFORTS. ALL THE VERY---- BEST IN BRINGING OUT THESE MEANINGFUL BOOKS.------------------- ENGLAND--------- - THANKS FOR SHARING THIS WONDERFUL, UPLIFTING BOOK WITH THE---- WHOLE WORLD. GOD BLESS US ALL.---------------------------------- XXXXX---------------------------- A---------------- VITAL---- MESSAGE--------------------------------------------------------- (BACK TO TOC)--------------- BY ERNEST MORGAN----------- NOW IN MY 95TH YEAR AND WITH FAILING HEALTH, I DON'T EXPECT TO BE AROUND MUCH LONGER.---- BUT I HAVE A VITAL MESSAGE TO LEAVE TO THE WORLD - AND ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA.----------- THE MALDISTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP AND INCOME IN OUR COUNTRY IS EXTREME AND IS RAPIDLY---- GETTING WORSE. CHARACTERISTICALLY THE CEOS OF LEADING INDUSTRIES-RECEIVE MORE THAN---- 400 TIMES THE PAY THAT THE RANK AND FILE WORKERS GET. SIMILARLY, THE RICHEST ONE PERCENT OF---- THE PEOPLE OWN MORE OF THE PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES THAN DO A LARGE PORTION OF THE REST OF OUR---- SOCIETY.----------- WE ENJOY TEMPORARY PROSPERITY BY THE ASTRONOMICAL EXPANSION OF DEBT. THE FEDERAL DEBT---- IS NOW OVER FIVE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS, AND PRIVATE DEBT IS EVEN LARGER.----------- HOW CAN WE PRESERVE OUR PROSPERITY? WHAT IS CALLED FOR IS AN ALMOST RELIGIOUS REVIVAL.---- OUR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY A PARADIGM OF GREED AND EXPLOITATION. WE MUST AS QUICKLY AS---- POSSIBLE SUBSTITUTE A PARADIGM OF CARING AND SHARING.----------- IT WILL ALREADY BE FOUND IN THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT, AND IN SOME INDIVIDUAL LIVES. MY---- FATHER, ARTHUR E. MORGAN, DEMONSTRATED IT IN HIS CAREER. IN HIS ENGINEERING PRACTICE WHEN---- HE HIRED OTHER ENGINEERS TO WORK FOR HIM, HE MADE THEM PARTNERS.----------- IN THE GIANT FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT WHICH HE DIRECTED AT DAYTON, OHIO, THERE WERE FIVE---- HUGE DAMS TO BE BUILT WHICH WOULD TAKE HUNDREDS OF MEN SEVEN YEARS. INSTEAD OF HOUSING---- THESE MEN IN THE USUAL TAR-PAPER SHACKS-HE BUILT FIVE BEAUTIFUL VILLAGES IN WOODED AREAS.---- THIS COST A LOT MORE THAN TAR-PAPER SHACKS BUT THE QUALITY AND STABILITY OF THE WORK FORCE---- WERE SO HIGH THAT IT ACTUALLY SAVED-MONEY. FURTHERMORE, THE ACCIDENT RATE WAS REDUCED BY---- 85% OVER WHAT WAS EXPECTED IN JOBS OF THAT SIZE, SAVING 30 LIVES.----------- I INHERITED MY-FATHER'S PHILOSOPHY. LAUNCHING A BUSINESS IN 1925, I RAN IT FOR 44-----YEARS, SHARING THE LEADERSHIP AND INCOME WITH MY EMPLOYEES. MY INCOME WAS NOT MUCH HIGHER---- THAN THEIRS, AND I DELIBERATELY RAN THE COMPANY AS A COMMUNITY. I HIRED BLACKS, JAPANESE---- - AMERICANS AND JEWISH REFUGEES FROM EUROPE-ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH EVERYONE ELSE. IN THE---- ATMOSPHERE OF COMMUNITY THE ETHNIC DIFFERENCES CEASED TO MATTER. OUR SALES POLICIES WERE---- CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO FIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CARING AND SHARING WAS A GREAT---- SUCCESS.----------- I STRONGLY URGE OUR SOCIETY TO SHIFT TO A PARADIGM OF CARING AND SHARING TO MAKE FREE---- ENTERPRISE A CONTINUING SUCCESS.------------------- PEACE PILGRIM-------------- - "WE HAVE GOODLY AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL DEMOCRACY.---- WE-ARE MAKING-PROGRESS ON SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. WHERE WE FALL THE SHORTEST IS IN ECONOMIC---- DEMOCRACY.---------------------------------------" XXXXX---------------------------- MID-COURSE CORRECTION--------------- - HE IS THE CEO OF A LARGE COMPANY THAT---- MANUFACTURES CARPET TILES FOR OFFICE, PRIMARILY. HE HAS COME TO MAKE THE DECISION TO---- ATTEMPT TO LEAD HIS COMPANY IN A DIRECTION WHICH WILL HELP HIM CONTRIBUTE TO CREATING A---- SUSTAINABLE WORLD THROUGH PROGRESSIVELY REDUCING THEIR USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND MATERIALS---- AND ENERGY, AND HAS FOUND THAT HIS COMPANY CAN, IN FACT, BE EVEN MORE PROFITABLE BY SO---- DOING.---------------------------------- XXXXX---------------------------- A CLOISTERED NUN IN INDIA--------- - MAY GOD REWARD YOU FOR THESE BOOKS. WE---- DISTRIBUTE THEM TO OUR VISITORS - THOSE WHO COME TO US SEEKING COMFORT AND CONSOLATION.---- ALSO TO PREACHERS WHO PASTURE GOD'S FLOCK. ALL APPRECIATE THEM.----------- WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS PEACE. THE KINGDOM OF THE PRINCE OF PEACE NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED---- ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE STEPS BOOKLETS ARE VERY PRACTICAL. THE WORLD NEEDS TO LEARN THE---- MAGIC OF FORGIVENESS.----------- WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY YOU IN CASH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY. WE SHALL CERTAINLY DO IT---- BY OUR POOR PRAYERS. BOTH YOU AND WE SHALL FIGHT THE BATTLE FOR THE SAME CAUSE - PEACE---- THAT PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. TODAY, INDIA, OUR BELOVED COUNTRY, KNOWN FOR ITS-----SPIRITUALITY, IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EVIL. THE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING - THE RICH BECOME---- RICHER AND THE POOR BECOME POORER.--------------------SUBSCRIBER-INFORMATION---------------------IF YOU-WANT FREE PEACE PILGRIM MATERIALS WRITE OR EMAIL US.
