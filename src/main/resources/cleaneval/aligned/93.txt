BAILEY - APPENDIX - THE PRINCIPLES OF THE-----ARCANE SCHOOL-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I. THE ARCANE SCHOOL IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR---- DISCIPLES----------  AT THE CLOSE OF THE WORLD WAR (1914-1945) THE ARCANE SCHOOL HAD-BEEN---- IN EXISTENCE FOR NEARLY 2--YEARS AND HAD, IN THAT TIME, SERVICED-OVER 20,000 PEOPLE. ITS---- CURRICULUM IS PROGRESSIVE; STEP BY STEP THE STUDIES-DEEPEN AND THE MEDITATION WORK BECOMES---- MORE INTENSIVE AS THE STUDENT PASSES-FROM ONE DEGREE TO ANOTHER.----------  NO TEACHING IS GIVEN AT ANY TIME IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PSYCHIC POWERS; PEOPLE ARE---- NOT TAUGHT TO BE CLAIRVOYANT OR CLAIRAUDIENT; NO TRAINING IS GIVEN IN MAGIC OR IN THE USE-----OF MAGICAL RITUALS, AND NOTHING IS TAUGHT-AT ANY STAGE ON SEX MAGIC. OUR WHOLE EMPHASIS IS---- LAID UPON SPIRITUAL LIVING, UPON THE MENTAL GRASP OF THE OCCULT TEACHING AND UPON THOSE---- RULES AND PROCESSES WHICH WILL BRING ABOUT RIGHT RELATIONS TO ONE'S FELLOWMEN, RIGHT---- RELATION TO ONE'S OWN SOUL, RIGHT RELATION TO THE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY (OF WHICH THE CHRIST---- IS THE SUPREME HEAD), AND RIGHT RELATION-TO A MASTER AND HIS ASHRAM, OR GROUP.----------  BECAUSE THE ARCANE SCHOOL IS DESIGNED SOLELY TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE CONSCIOUS, WORKING---- DISCIPLES, ITS CURRICULUM IS DEFINITELY ELIMINATIVE. THE WORK YOU ARE ASKED TO DO IS NOT---- EASY, NOR IS IT INTENDED TO BE EASY. THE STANDARD MAINTAINED AND DESIRED-IS HIGH AND THE---- WORK IS PLANNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THOSE WHOSE MENTAL EQUIPMENT AND SPIRITUAL ASPIRATION-----ARE INADEQUATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS AUTOMATICALLY DROP OUT; THEY FIND,--- FOR THEMSELVES,---- THAT---- THEY CANNOT COPE WITH THE WORK. WE NEVER ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STAY-IN THE WORK UNLESS THEY---- SHOW FITNESS, FOR THEY ONLY GET DISCOURAGED AND LABOR-UNDER A SENSE OF FAILURE AND THIS IS---- BAD FOR ALL CONCERNED.----------  DISCIPLESHIP ENTAILS-A LOVING HEART AND A-KEEN, ALERT MIND. THE LOVING HEART HAS ALWAYS ----BEEN EMPHASIZED, PLUS DEVOTION, BY THE CHURCHES AND THE ESOTERIC GROUPS. THIS IS A BASIC ----TRUTH AND NECESSITY, BUT A KEEN, ALERT AND TRAINED MIND IS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE. THE---- MASTERS REACH THE WORLD OF MEN THROUGH THEIR DISCIPLES; THAT IS THE-WAY THEY CHOOSE TO---- WORK. THEY ARE SEEKING, THEREFORE, INTELLIGENT, [283] SELF-CONTROLLED MEN AND WOMEN - WITH---- VISION AND WITH A SELF-IMPOSED, SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE---THROUGH WHOM THAT WORK CAN BE---- CARRIED FORWARD. INTENTIONALLY, THEREFORE, WE MAKE THE WORK DIFFICULT AND KEEP THE---- STANDARD OF REQUIREMENTS HIGH BECAUSE WE, TOO, ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN USE THEIR-----MINDS OR WHO SHOW AT LEAST--- A WILLINGNESS---- TO DEVELOP AND USE THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES.---- THE-NEED OF THE MORE EMOTIONAL AND ASPIRATIONAL TYPES AND OF THE DEVOTEES CAN WELL BE MET---- IN OTHER GROUPS AND-ESOTERIC SCHOOLS, AND IS THUS BEING MET.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RUNNING---- THROUGH ALL THE-WORK OF THE ARCANE SCHOOL IS THE THEME OF SERVICE. SERVICE TO ONE'S---- FELLOWMEN IS THE HALLMARK OF A DISCIPLE AND THE KEY ALSO WHICH OPENS FOR HIM THE DOOR OF---- INITIATION. THEREFORE, ALL WHO ENTER THE SCHOOL AND FACE THE NEW CYCLE OF TRAINING FIND US---- SAYING TO THEM: STUDY, THINK AND PROVE TO YOURSELF AND TO US THAT YOU HAVE GRASPED-THE---- TEACHING BY WRITING YOUR STUDY PAPERS; LEARN TO MEDITATE AND SO MAKE A CONTACT WITH YOUR---- TRUE SPIRITUAL SELF, THE SOUL, AND MAKE SERVICE THE EXPRESSION OF WHAT YOU KNOW. THESE---- THREE THINGS SHOULD BE YOUR MAIN SPIRITUAL PREOCCUPATION DURING THE TIME SPENT IN THE---- EARLIER DEGREES. YOU WILL FIND THAT, AS EACH YEAR SLIPS AWAY, YOUR GRASP OF THE WAY INTO---- THE HIERARCHY GROWS STEADILY AND YOUR ENTIRE LIFE WILL BE TAKING ON FULLER AND RICHER---- MEANING. IT IS THE WORLD-OF MEANING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PENETRATE. YOU WILL THEN FIND---- THAT THE SUCCEEDING DEGREES WILL OPEN THEIR DOORS TO YOU, FOR YOU WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE-----COVERED THE NECESSARY PRELIMINARY WORK, TO HAVE ASSIMILATED A CERTAIN MEASURE OF TECHNICAL---- AND ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE, TO HAVE CERTAIN SPIRITUAL CONTACTS AND ARRIVED AT CERTAIN GREAT---- RECOGNITIONS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
