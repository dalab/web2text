BUT IF THESE FIVE MEN - ERIKSSON, OWEN, BECKHAM, GERRARD AND ROONEY - PERFORM AT THEIR BEST NEXT SUMMER, THEN ENGLAND WILL BE THE TEAM TO FEAR.------------------------------------------------------------------ MAINLY BECAUSE THIS YOUNG SIDE FEARS ABSOLUTELY NO-ONE AS THE RESULTS AGAINST GERMANY, ARGENTINA AND TWICE AGAINST TURKEY SHOW. NEXT SUMMER THEY WILL BE OLDER, BETTER AND EVEN MORE FEARLESS.------------------------------------------------------------------ BESIDES WITH ERIKSSON'S RECORD, AND A RANKING OF SIXTH IN THE WORLD, WITH FRANCE AND SPAIN THE ONLY EUROPEANS ABOVE THEM, WHO SHOULD THEY FEAR?------------------------------------------------------------------ PORTUGAL WILL BE GOOD BUT UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE NOT TO FAIL, SPAIN ARE ETERNAL UNDER-ACHIEVERS, WE HAVE BATTERED GERMANY, SEEN WALES BEAT ITALY, AND FRANCE HAVE BEEN IN DECLINE FOR THREE YEARS.------------------------------------------------------------------ ENGLAND WILL NOT BE THE MOST TECHNICALLY-GIFTED TEAM OUT THERE, BUT AS THE GERMANS CONSISTENTLY SHOW, WHY WORRY ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A COACH, A SYSTEM, A FEW WORLD-CLASS PLAYERS AND LUCK.
