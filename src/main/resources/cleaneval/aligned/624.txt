THE MAJORITY OF- PAINTINGS ONE SEES IN MOST GALLERIES AND MUSEUMS ARE DONE WITH-OIL PAINT.-STILL,- IT NEVER HURTS TO KNOW A-LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE MEDIUM.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OIL PAINT CONSISTS OF PIGMENT SUSPENDED IN A VEGETABLE-BASED OIL. THE OILS- USED ARE DRYING OILS, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT LEFT EXPOSED TO AIR FOR A LENGTH OF- TIME, THEY EVENTUALLY CURE THROUGH AN OXIDATION PROCESS AND BECOME HARD AND- PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO THE PAINTING SURFACE. LINSEED OIL IS THE MOST COMMON, BUT- SAFFLOWER, POPPY, AND WALNUT OILS ARE USED AS WELL. THE DIFFERENT OILS HAVE- DIFFERENT PROPERTIES IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THE CURING PROCESS TAKES, HOW HARD THE- OIL FILM BECOMES, HOW RESISTANT-TO CRACKING OR YELLOWING IT BECOMES, AND SO- FORTH.------  ONCE CURED, A PAINTING NEEDS RELATIVELY LITTLE IN-THE WAY OF-PROTECTION,- ALTHOUGH VARNISH-IS COMMON TO PROTECT AGAINST ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS. STILL,--OVER TIME, THE PAINTING MAY BE-SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRACKING AND/OR YELLOWING. THESE- RISKS CAN BE LESSENED IF PROPER CARE IS TAKEN WHEN CREATING-THE PAINTING IN THE- FIRST PLACE,-AS CERTAIN TECHNIQUES ARE MORE PRONE TO EVENTUAL PROBLEMS THAN- OTHERS. SEE THE SECTION ON------------------MAKING MARKS---- BELOW.----------------------------  BUYING OIL PAINT-------  THERE ARE A FEW QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ANSWER BEFORE-BUYING OIL-PAINTS.-------  STUDENT VERSUS ARTIST QUALITY-------  THIS IS THE VERY FIRST QUESTION A NEWCOMER TO OIL PAINTING HAS TO ANSWER FOR- HIMSELF. THE STUDENT GRADES ARE, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, LESS EXPENSIVE, AND OF- CORRESPONDINGLY LOWER QUALITY. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DEBATE AMONG ART EDUCATORS- AS TO WHETHER THE TRADE-OFF IS WORTHWHILE. I PERSONALLY DO NOT HAVE STRONG- FEELINGS ON THE MATTER, SO I CAN TRY TO BE REASONABLY OBJECTIVE HERE.------  FIRST, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT----- "LOWER QUALITY-----" ACTUALLY MEANS IN- PRACTICE. THIS CAN VARY BY MANUFACTURER. IN SOME CASES, FILLERS MAY BE USED THAT- COMPROMISE THE PERMANENCE OF THE RESULTING PAINTINGS. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT- CONCERN YOU AT ALL WHEN YOU-ARE FIRST STARTING OUT. IT IS ALSO USUALLY THE CASE- THAT LESS PIGMENT IS USED PER TUBE THAN IN ARTIST QUALITY PAINT. AS FAR AS I CAN- TELL,-IF ALL YOUR PAINTS ARE STUDENT GRADE, THIS SHOULD NOT MATTER MUCH, BUT IT- WOULD SEEM TRUE THAT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF STUDENT QUALITY YELLOW TO MAKE A- GREEN WHEN MIXED WITH AN ARTIST QUALITY BLUE, FOR EXAMPLE.------  PERHAPS THE MOST PROBLEMATIC ISSUE WITH STUDENT GRADE PAINTS IS THE TENDENCY- TO USE LESS EXPENSIVE SUBSTITUTE PIGMENTS IN SOME COLORS. THESE ARE GENERALLY- LABELED----- "HUES-----".------ FOR EXAMPLE, A PAINT LABELED----- "CADMIUM RED HUE-----" IS MORE OR- LESS THE SAME COLOR AS CADMIUM RED BUT CONTAINS A LESS EXPENSIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR- THE-QUITE EXPENSIVE CADMIUM RED PIGMENT. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THIS USE OF----- "HUES------" TO BE REASON ENOUGH TO AVOID STUDENT GRADE PAINTS. I DISAGREE. JUST BECAUSE A- PIGMENT IS LESS EXPENSIVE DOES NOT MEAN IT IS INFERIOR. I HAPPEN TO PREFER- SEVERAL OF THE CHEAPER PIGMENTS OFTEN USED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR CADMIUM RED OVER- CADMIUM RED ITSELF. AS LONG AS YOU ARE AWARE YOU ARE NOT GETTING CADMIUM RED,- AND THEREFORE THE PAINT WILL NOT BEHAVE IN ALL RESPECTS LIKE CADMIUM RED, YOU- MIGHT WELL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU ARE GETTING INSTEAD.------  THERE MAY WELL BE OTHER MORE SUBJECTIVE ISSUES WITH SOME STUDENT GRADE- BRANDS.------ IN PARTICULAR THE----- "FEEL-----" OF THE PAINT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM- ARTIST QUALITY PAINTS, IN TERMS OF THICK OR OILY OR BUTTERY OR CREAMY THE PAINT- FEELS. ON THE OTHER HAND, EACH ARTIST QUALITY BRAND FEELS DIFFERENT AS WELL, SO- IN THE END, IT COMES-DOWN TO PERSONAL PREFERENCE IN MOST CASES.------  NOW, CONVERSELY, I SHOULD POINT OUT ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OR USING ARTIST- QUALITY PAINT. TO START WITH, THE PRICE DIFFERENCE IS NOT THAT EXTREME, IF YOU- COMPARE PAINTS MADE FROM SIMILAR PIGMENTS AND CONSIDER HOW MUCH YOU WILL- ACTUALLY-USE. A TUBE OF STUDENT QUALITY ULTRAMARINE BLUE MIGHT SELL FOR----AND- ONE-OF ARTIST QUALITY FOR $6, AND EITHER TUBE WILL MOST LIKELY LAST YOU SEVERAL- MONTHS, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU PAINT. SURE, YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN ONE TUBE- OF PAINT, BUT STILL, THE TOTAL DIFFERENCE IN PAINT COSTS OVER THE COURSE OF A- YEAR MIGHT WELL BE LESS THAN THE COST OF DINNER FOR TWO AT A CHAIN RESTAURANT.------  THERE IS ALSO THE DANGER THE STUDENT GRADE PAINT YOU CHOOSE WILL BE SO- COMPROMISED IN QUALITY THAT YOU GET FRUSTRATED WITH IT AND GIVE UP ON PAINTING.- THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE MOST LIKELY IF THE PIGMENT STRENGTH WAS VERY LOW OR- TEXTURE WAY TOO OILY OR TOO STIFF, WHICH CAN INDEED MAKING MIXING AND APPLYING- PAINT MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT NEED BE.------  SO YOU MAY WELL DECIDE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE-IS MORE THAN WORTHWHILE. -THAT WILL HAVE TO BE UP TO YOU.-------  WATER MISCIBLE OILS-------  OIL PAINTS ARE TRADITIONALLY MADE FROM LINSEED OIL, WHICH, LIKE MOST OILS, IS--NOT WATER SOLUBLE. THIS MEANS THAT YOU TYPICALLY NEED SOMETHING LIKE TURPENTINE,- MINERAL SPIRITS, OR A CITRUS-BASED SOLVENT FOR CLEANUP AND FOR THINNING PAINT.- RECENTLY, PAINTS MADE FROM CHEMICALLY MODIFIED OILS HAVE COME ON THE MARKET, AND- THESE ALLOW CLEANUP WITH JUST SOAP AND WATER. SEVERAL MANUFACTURERS OFFER THESE- TYPES OF PAINTS. SOME SAY THEY DO NOT HANDLE THE-SAME AS ORDINARY OILS, BUT- GIVEN THE CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS ECOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF NOT NEEDING TO DEAL- WITH SOLVENTS, THESE PAINTS ARE PROVING QUITE POPULAR, ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE- NEW TO THE MEDIUM.--------  ALKYDS-------  ANOTHER TYPE OF CHEMICALLY MODIFIED OIL PAINT ARE THE ALKYDS. THESE ARE LIKE- TRADITIONAL OIL PAINTS IN ALL RESPECTS EXCEPT ONE: THEY CURE-MUCH MORE QUICKLY.- WHEREAS A TYPICAL OIL PAINTING MIGHT-TAKE A WEEK-OR MORE BEFORE IT IS-DRY ENOUGH--TO HANDLE EASILY WITHOUT-RISKING DAMAGE-TO THE SURFACE, AN ALKYD PAINTING- REACHES THAT POINT IN AROUND ONE DAY.----------OIL PAINT BRANDS-------  ONCE YOU'VE SETTLED THE STUDENT-VERSUS ARTIST GRADE ISSUE, THEN YOU CAN PICK- SPECIFIC BRANDS. I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT BRANDS TO REALLY- OFFER MUCH ADVICE. I CAN RECOMMEND--- THE OIL PAINTING BOOK----, BY BILL CREEVY,- FOR INFORMATION ON DIFFERENT BRANDS, ALTHOUGH IT IS BOUND TO BE SOMEWHAT OUT OF- DATE, AS SMALLER COMPANIES COME AND GO AND EVEN LARGER ONES CHANGES THEIR- FORMULATIONS. BUT HERE ARE SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR BRANDS AND WHAT I KNOW ABOUT- THEM:-------  WINSOR---- & NEWTON-------  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OIL PAINT BRANDS, FOUND IN MOST ART STORES.- THEIR ARTIST QUALITY PAINTS ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND THEIR STUDENT GRADE- PAINTS (WINTON) ARE EVEN MORE SO.-------  GRUMBACHER-------  THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE MOST POPULAR BRANDS, CHEAPER THAN WINSOR---- & NEWTON FOR- THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH PROBABLY OF LESSER QUALITY AS WELL.-------  UTRECHT-------  THIS IS ONE OF THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ARTIST QUALITY PAINTS ON THE MARKET. IT IS- THEREFORE QUITE POPULAR, EVEN THOUGH IT IS AVAILABLE ONLY VIA MAIL ORDER OR FROM- A FEW SELECT STORES.-------  REMBRANDT-------  THESE OIL PAINTS ARE PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WINSOR---- & NEWTON,- BUT THEY HAVE A GOOD REPUTATION FOR QUALITY. THEIR PAINTS ARE GENERALLY LIGHTER- AND MORE MOUSSE-LIKE IN TEXTURE THAN MOST.-------- OLD HOLLAND-------  ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AS LARGE A COMPANY AS WINSOR---- & NEWTON, GRUMBACHER, OR- TALENS, OLD HOLLAND OIL PAINTS ARE STILL REASONABLY WIDELY AVAILABLE.------ THEY- CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE FINEST OF THE MAJOR BRANDS, AND THE PRICE IS- CONSISTENT WITH THIS.-------  GAMBLIN-------  THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR OF THE SMALLER BRANDS. THE PAINTS ARE MADE BY- AN ARTIST, ROBERT GAMBLIN.-------  M. GRAHAM-------  THESE PAINTS ARE MADE WITH WALNUT OIL INSTEAD OF LINSEED OIL. THE ADVANTAGES- AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS HAVE BEEN DEBATED OVER THE YEARS, BUT THE CLAIM IS- THAT PAINTINGS MADE FROM WALNUT OIL PAINTS WILL YELLOW LESS AND BE LESS- SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRACKING OVER TIME. ONE TRADEOFF IS THAT WALNUT OIL DRIES MORE- SLOWLY THAN LINSEED OIL. M. GRAHAM ALSO MAKES AN ALKYD WHITE, AND BY USING THIS- IN CONJUNCTION WITH WALNUT OIL COLORS FOR THE REST OF YOUR PAINTING, YOU END UP- WITH A CURING TIME MORE SIMILAR TO LINSEED OIL, SINCE WHITE IS-MIXED INTO-MOST- OTHER COLORS.-------  PALETTE-------  HERE, I DO NOT MEAN THE THING YOU SQUEEZE YOUR PAINT ONTO. I MEAN, THE LIST- OF COLORS YOU SQUEEZE OUT. DIFFERENT PAINTERS USE DIFFERENT PALETTES, AND MANY- ALTER THEIR PALETTE ACCORDING TO THE PAINTING.------  CHOOSING A PALETTE IS SUCH A PERSONAL THING, BUT I CAN MENTION SOME OF THE- THINGS ARTISTS OFTEN CONSIDER.------  COLOR IS THE MOST OBVIOUS CONSIDERATION IN CHOOSING A PALETTE, BUT EVEN- THERE, THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS YOU WANT TO OPTIMIZE IN CHOOSING YOUR COLORS.------  FIRST, YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MIX ANY COLOR YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY NEED. THIS -GENERALLY REQUIRES HAVING AT THE VERY LEAST THE THREE PRIMARIES, AND MANY- ARTISTS PREFER HAVING TWO OF EACH PRIMARY - A WARMER AND COOLER VARIANT.------  SECOND, YOU WANT TO MAKE IT EASY TO MIX THE COLORS YOU NEED MOST OFTEN. FOR- EXAMPLE, A PALETTE CONSISTING OF JUST THE PRIMARIES MAY MAKE IT--- POSSIBLE----- TO-MIX A BELIEVABLE SKIN TONE, BUT ONE THAT ALSO INCLUDES SOME MORE SUBDUED--------EARTH TONES-----" MIGHT MAKE IT--- EASIER----.------  YOU OFTEN HEAR ARTISTS TALKING ABOUT A----- "LIMITED PALETTE-----". THIS SIMPLY MEANS- HAVING FEWER COLORS AVAILABLE THAN ONE MIGHT OTHERWISE CHOOSE. FOR SOME ARTISTS,- 12 COLORS IS LIMITED. OTHERS MAY ROUTINELY PAINT WITH ONLY 6 AND CONSIDER 3 A- LIMITED PALETTE.------  ONE REASON TO CONSIDER LIMITING YOUR PALETTE IS COLOR HARMONY. ROUGHLY- SPEAKING, THIS IS HOW GOOD THE COLORS IN A PAINTING LOOK TOGETHER. IT IS OFTEN- EASIER TO GET COLORS THAT GO WELL TOGETHER IF THEY ARE ALL MIXED FROM JUST A FEW- PALETTE COLORS, RATHER THAN HAVING EVERY POSSIBLE COLOR ON YOUR PALETTE.------  ANOTHER REASON TO CONSIDER LIMITING YOUR PALETTE IS THAT IT IS CHEAPER TO BUY- A FEW TUBES OF PAINT THAN MANY. IT IS ALSO EASIER TO CARRY FEWER TUBES AROUND,- SO PLEIN AIR PAINTERS ARE ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO TRY TO LIMIT THEIR PALETTES. AND--SOME ARGUE-THAT IT IS EASIER TO-LEARN TO USE JUST A FEW COLORS WELL THAN TO TRY -TO LEARN TO USE MANY AT-ONCE. I PERSONALLY-FIND COLOR-MIXING GREATLY SIMPLIFIED- WHEN THERE ARE FEWER COLORS ON MY PALETTE - THERE ARE FEWER CHOICES, MAKING IT- IS EASIER TO SEE WHAT PAINTS NEED TO BE MIXED TO GET A GIVEN COLOR.------  IN ADDITION TO THE COLOR OF THE PAINTS, THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN- CHOOSING A PALETTE AS WELL. THERE IS A-LOT OF VARIANCE BETWEEN-PIGMENTS IN- PRICE, SO EVEN WITHIN A SINGLE BRAND, SOME PAINTS MIGHT COST THREE OR MORE TIMES- AS MUCH AS OTHERS. AGAIN, PRICE DOES NOT NECESSARILY-CORRELATE WITH QUALITY -HERE, AND QUITE VIABLE PALETTES CAN BE FORMED FROM THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PIGMENTS.- ALSO, SOME PIGMENTS ARE MORE-PERMANENT THAN OTHERS, AND THIS-TOO DOES NOT- NECESSARILY-CORRELATE WITH PRICE. SOME PIGMENTS ARE MORE TRANSPARENT THAN- OTHERS, AND DEPENDING-ON YOUR PAINTING STYLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE- OR THE OTHER. OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR HAVING BOTH TRANSPARENT AND- OPAQUE CHOICES. FINALLY, SOME PIGMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TOXIC, AND SOME ARTISTS- CHOOSE-TO AVOID THESE FOR HEALTH REASONS.--------SO WITH ALL THIS SAID, SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY- CHOOSING YOUR PAINTS. THERE ARE SOME PIGMENTS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY MANUFACTURER- OFFERS, BUT THE NAMING OFTEN-DIFFERS, AND THERE ARE MANY COLORS UNIQUE TO-A--GIVEN MANUFACTURER. SOME COLORS OFFERED BY MANY MANUFACTURERS ARE ACTUALLY- MIXTURES OF TWO OR MORE PIGMENTS, AND THESE MIXTURES WILL VARY EVEN BETWEEN- SIMILARLY-NAMED COLORS FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS. THERE ARE FAR MORE COLORS- AVAILABLE THAN I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT. BUT I AM LISTING SOME OF-THE ONES I OFTEN- SEE PEOPLE USING.------  THE FOLLOWING COLORS ARE THE FULL-INTENSITY COLORS, SOMETIMES JUST CALLED THE- COLOR WHEEL COLORS. THEY ARE LISTED MORE OR LESS IN COLOR WHEEL ORDER. REMEMBER,- BETWEEN TWO SIMILAR COLORS, THE WARMER ONE IS THE ONE CLOSER TO ORANGE ON THE- WHEEL, AND THE COOLER ONE IS THE ONE CLOSER TO BLUE.--------------  AZO YELLOW - COOL YELLOW----------  CADMIUM YELLOW LIGHT / LEMON - OPAQUE COOL YELLOW. ALL CADMIUMS ARE--- EXPENSIVE----------  HANSA / ARYLIDE YELLOW - TRANSPARENT NEUTRAL (NEITHER ESPECIALLY COOL NOR--- WARM) YELLOW----------  CADMIUM YELLOW MEDIUM / DEEP - OPAQUE WARM YELLOW----------  CADMIUM ORANGE - OPAQUE----------  CADMIUM RED LIGHT / MEDIUM - OPAQUE WARM RED----------  NAPHTHOL / PYRROL RED - TRANSPARENT WARM RED----------  ALIZARIN CRIMSON - TRANSPARENT COOL RED, SELDOM USED ANY MORE BECAUSE IT--- IS NOT VERY PERMANENT----------  QUINACRIDONE RED / ROSE / VIOLET - TRANSPARENT COOL RED----------  DIOXAZINE PURPLE - TRANSPARENT----------  ULTRAMARINE / FRENCH ULTRAMARINE BLUE - TRANSPARENT BLUE ON THE VIOLET--- SIDE----------  COBALT BLUE - TRANSPARENT NEUTRAL BLUE, VERY EXPENSIVE----------  PHTHALO BLUE - TRANSPARENT BLUE-ON THE GREEN SIDE, EXTREMELY POWERFUL----(SOME SAY OVERPOWERING)----------  PRUSSIAN BLUE - TRANSPARENT GREENISH, COPPERY BLUE----------  CERULEAN - OPAQUE, LIGHT GREENISH BLUE, EXPENSIVE WHEN GENUINE BUT OFTEN--- PRODUCED AS A MIXTURE OF CHEAPER PIGMENTS----------  VIRIDIAN - DEEP, TRANSPARENT COOL GREEN, EXPENSIVE----------  PHTHALO GREEN - TRANSPARENT COOL GREEN, ALSO VERY POWERFUL----------  SAP GREEN - WARM GREEN, OFTEN A MIXTURE OF PIGMENTS-------------  THE FOLLOWING COLORS ARE LESS INTENSE, AND ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE EARTH- TONES.--------------  NAPLES YELLOW - VERY LIGHT AND SOMEWHAT DULL YELLOW, SOMETIMES USED AS A--- SUBSTITUTE FOR WHITE----------  YELLOW OCHRE - DULL MUSTARD YELLOW----------  BURNT SIENNA / RED OXIDE - REDDISH BROWN----------  BURNT UMBER - DULL BROWNISH GRAY----------  PAYNE'S GRAY---GRAY FROM A-MIXTURE OF-PIGMENTS----------  BLACK - SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE HERE----------  WHITE - SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS HERE TOO; TITANIUM IS PROBABLY THE MOST--- POPULAR-------------  OF COURSE, I AM NOT SUGGESTING YOU HAVE ALL THESE COLORS ON YOUR PALETTE. BUT- HOPEFULLY IT WELL HELP YOU DECIDE WHAT COLORS INTERESTED YOU. IT MIGHT ALSO HELP- YOU UNDERSTAND SUGGESTED PALETTES YOU FIND ELSEWHERE.------  ONE WORD ON BLACK, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF PIGMENTS IN- OIL. SOME SAY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE IT AT ALL, SOME SAY HAVE-IT BUT DO NOT RELY ON- IT EVERY TIME YOU YOU WANT TO DARKEN A COLOR, AND SOME SIMPLY LOVE IT. I AM OF- THE OPINION THAT IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A COLOR LIKE ANY OTHER. IF YOU ARE- TRYING TO LIMIT YOUR PALETTE AND INCLUDE ONLY A BARE MINIMUM TO GET THE JOB- DONE, BLACK IS CLEARLY NOT NECESSARY. MOST COLORS CAN BE DARKENED EFFECTIVE BY- MIXING IN THEIR COMPLEMENT, AND A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION TO BLACK ITSELF CAN- BE MIXED SIMPLY-BY COMBINING OTHER DARK PIGMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS- NOTHING WRONG WITH BLACK PIGMENT THAT WOULD MAKE ME AVOID IT IF I WAS INCLUDING- OTHER SO-CALLED----- "CONVENIENCE-----" COLORS - ONES YOU CAN REASONABLY MIX YOURSELF- - LIKE PURPLE, ORANGE, GREEN, OR ANY OF THE EARTH TONES.------  ONCE YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR COLORS, YOU CAN ARRANGE THEM PHYSICALLY ON YOUR--PALETTE ANY WAY-YOU LIKE. BUT OF COURSE YOU DO NEED A PHYSICAL PALETTE TO DO--THIS ON. MOST TRADITIONAL IS WOOD THAT HAS BEEN PRIMED TO MAKE-IT LESS--ABSORBENT,-BUT GLASS AND PLASTIC PALETTES ARE ALSO USED. THERE ARE ALSO- DISPOSABLE PALETTES, WHICH ARE PADS OF PAPER THAT HAS BEEN SPECIALLY COATED TO- MAKE IT LESS ABSORBENT.------  AS FOR THE PROCESS OF SQUEEZING OUT THE PAINT, TYPICAL IS TO SQUEEZE THEM OUT- ALONG THE EDGES OF YOUR PALETTE, IN BLOBS OF-ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT YOU WOULD USE- TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH. MANY ARTISTS PUT THE COLORS IN COLOR WHEEL ORDER. THE- CENTER OF YOUR PALETTE IS LEFT CLEAR FOR MIXING.----------------------------  MEDIUMS AND SOLVENTS-------  THERE IS A LARGE VARIETY OF PAINTING--- MEDIUMS---- (AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,- IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PLURAL OF MEDIUM IS USUALLY----- "MEDIUMS-----", NOT----- "MEDIA-----") ON THE- MARKET. THESE ARE SUBSTANCES THAT YOU CAN MIX WITH YOUR PAINTS AS YOU APPLY THEM- TO GET DIFFERENT EFFECTS. SOME MEDIUMS ARE DESIGNED TO SPEED UP DRYING, OTHERS- TO SLOW IT DOWN. SOME ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE PAINT MORE FLUID, SOME TO MAKE IT- MORE LIKE PASTE. OTHER MEDIUMS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE PAINTS MORE TRANSPARENT.------  STRICTLY SPEAKING, MEDIUMS ARE NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PAINT WITH OIL, AND- MANY ARTISTS - ESPECIALLY PLEIN AIR PAINTERS, WHO ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO CUT DOWN- ON UNNECESSARY SUPPLIES - DO NOT USE THEM AT ALL. BUT SOME PAINTINGS TECHNIQUES- - ESPECIALLY ONES THAT INVOLVE PAINTING IN MULTIPLE LAYERS OVER THE COURSE OF- DAYS, WEEKS, OR MONTHS - REQUIRE THE USE OF MEDIUMS. I WILL DISCUSS THIS FURTHER- IN THE SECTION ON----------------- MAKING MARKS----.------  AS A MORE OR LESS SEPARATE ISSUE, THERE ARE--- SOLVENTS----. YOU CAN USE A- SOLVENT AS A PAINTING MEDIUM, AND IT HAS THE EFFECT OF MAKING THE PAINT MORE- FLUID, TRANSPARENT, AND FASTER DRYING. BUT SOLVENTS ARE ALSO USED FOR CLEANING- BRUSHES, BOTH BETWEEN STROKES AND AT THE END OF A SESSION, AND FOR OTHER GENERAL- CLEANUP OF OIL PAINT. AND A RAG DIPPED IN SOLVENT CAN BE USED TO WIPE PAINT OFF- THE SURFACE, TO CORRECT OR LIGHTEN AN AREA. SOLVENTS ARE BY NATURE PRETTY TOXIC, -AND ONE REASON THE MAIN REASON WATER MISCIBLE OILS ARE SO POPULAR IS THAT THEY- ALLOW YOU TO AVOID SOLVENTS ENTIRELY. THE TRADITIONAL SOLVENT IS TURPENTINE,- WHICH IS NOT ONLY TOXIC AS A LIQUID BUT ALSO GIVES OFF VERY POWERFUL FUMES AND- CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN USING IT INDOORS. ODORLESS MINERAL SPIRITS ARE POPULAR- TODAY, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALMOST AS TOXIC - THE FUMES SIMPLY DO NOT SMELL AS- STRONG. SOME ARE TURNING TO CITRUS BASED SOLVENTS, WHICH ARE LESS TOXIC IN SOME- WAYS, BUT STILL NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.------  ALTHOUGH FEW SEEM TO REALIZE THIS, SOLVENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY NECESSARY FOR- CLEANUP EVEN WITH TRADITIONAL OIL PAINT. OIL CAN BE USED INSTEAD. SOME PEOPLE- USE CHEAP VEGETABLE OIL FOR CLEANING THEIR BRUSHES, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD CONCERN ME- THAT THIS IS NOT A DRYING OIL, AND ANY OIL LEFT IN THE BRUSH MIGHT INTERFERE- WITH THE PAINT. I USE WALNUT OIL, WHICH IS THE SAME OIL MY PAINTS ARE MADE FROM.- I CAN USE THIS OIL AS A PAINTING MEDIUM - WHICH MAKES THE PAINT MORE FLUID BUT- ALSO SLOWER DRYING - AS WELL AS FOR CLEANUP. WALNUT OIL IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN- VEGETABLE OIL, BUT I USE SO LITTLE OF IT - ABOUT A TABLESPOON OR TWO PER- PAINTING - THAT IT HARDLY MATTERS. YOU DO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO BUY WALNUT OIL- WITH NO PRESERVATIVES, WHICH WOULD FUNCTION TO RETARD THE DRYING EVEN FURTHER.------------------------------  SURFACES-------  THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURFACES THAT ARTISTS USE FOR- OIL PAINTINGS: STRETCHED CANVAS, CANVAS-COVERED BOARDS, AND GESSO-PRIMED BOARDS.- ANY OF THESE CAN BE BOUGHT READY-MADE, OR YOU CAN CONSTRUCT YOUR OWN, USUALLY- FOR LESS MONEY. SOME ARTISTS WILL ALSO EXPERIMENT WITH PAINTING ON PAPER ON- METAL OR OTHER SURFACES, BUT THE MAJORITY OF PAINTINGS ARE ON ONE OF THE- AFOREMENTIONED SURFACES.------  OIL PAINT BY ITS NATURE IS SOMEWHAT CORROSIVE, AND MOST SURFACES NEED TO BE- PROTECTED FROM THESE EFFECTS BY PRIMING WITH EITHER A GLUE OR AN ACRYLIC GESSO.- WHEN YOU BUY READY-MADE CANVASES, THEY ARE ALREADY PRIMED. IF YOU MAKE YOUR OWN- SURFACE, YOU CAN EITHER BUY PRE-PRIMED CANVAS, OR BUY RAW CANVAS AND PRIME IT- YOURSELF.------  STRETCHED CANVAS IS CANVAS THAT HAS BEEN STRETCHED TIGHT LIKE A DRUM HEAD- ACROSS A WOODEN FRAME CALLED A STRETCHER. STRETCHED-CANVAS HAS-THE ADVANTAGE OF- BEING RELATIVELY LIGHTWEIGHT EVEN IN LARGE SIZES. CANVAS COVERED BOARDS ARE- POPULAR FOR PLEIN AIR WORK AS THEY ARE GENERALLY THINNER THAN THE STRETCHER- BARS, MAKING IT EASIER TO TRANSPORT SEVERAL OF THEM. YOU ALSO DO NOT HAVE TO- WORRY ABOUT THE SUN SHINING THROUGH THE BACK OF A BOARD. CHEAP CANVAS BOARDS ARE- MADE FROM CARDBOARD. BETTER ONES ARE MADE FROM SOME SORT OF WOOD. THESE BOARDS- CAN ALSO BE PRIMED DIRECTLY, WITHOUT FIRST COVERING THEM WITH CANVAS. THE- SURFACE FEELS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM CANVAS, AS IT IS GENERALLY SMOOTHER. SOME- PREFER THIS, SOME DO NOT.-----------------------------  BRUSHES AND OTHER TOOLS-------  TO FURTHER ADD TO THE CONFUSION FACED BY BEGINNING OIL PAINTERS, THERE ARE AS- MANY DIFFERENT BRUSHES TO CHOOSE FROM AS PAINTS AND MEDIUMS. THE GOOD NEWS IS,- YOU CAN GET BY JUST FINE WITH VERY FEW BRUSHES. IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR PLEIN- AIR PAINTERS TO USE JUST ONE BRUSH FOR AN ENTIRE PAINTING, ALTHOUGH MOST PREFER- HAVING A COUPLE OF-DIFFERENT SIZES AVAILABLE. AND IT IS MORE CONVENIENT IF YOU- HAVE DIFFERENT BRUSHES FOR DIFFERENT COLORS - LESS CLEANING-BETWEEN STROKES IS- NECESSARY. LITERALLY HAVING ONE BRUSH FOR EACH COLOR IS NOT NECESSARY. YOU CAN- STILL GET SOME BENEFIT FROM USING ONE BRUSH FOR DARK COLORS, ANOTHER FOR LIGHT.- OR ONE FOR WARM COLORS, ANOTHER FOR COOL. EITHER WAY, YOU REDUCE THE RISK OF- CREATING MUDDY COLORS BY INADVERTENTLY MIXING VERY UNRELATED COLORS TOGETHER.------  BRUSHES COME IN DIFFERENT SHAPES, MATERIALS, AND SIZES. THE COMMON SHAPES- ARE:--------------  ROUND - AN ELONGATED CONE----------  FLAT - RECTANGULAR WHEN SEEN STRAIGHT ON, THIN FROM THE SIDE----------  FILBERT - LIKE A FLAT BUT WITH ROUNDED CORNERS ON THE TIP----------  BRIGHT - A RELATIVELY SHORT FLAT-------------  OTHER SPECIALTY BRUSHES ARE AVAILABLE, SUCH AS THE FAN BLENDER, WHICH SOME- USED TO SOFTLY BLEND COLORS TOGETHER AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLIED.------  WHILE MANY PEOPLE DO USE DIFFERENT SHAPED BRUSHES FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES,- THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE AGREEMENT ON WHICH SHAPES ARE BEST FOR WHICH- PURPOSES. AND IN FACT, IT IS JUST AS COMMON FOR AN ARTIST TO USE ONLY ONLY SHAPE- FOR ALL PARTS OF A PAINTING. FILBERTS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE. I AM- FINDING I PREFER THE VARIETY OF MARKS I CAN MAKE WITH A FLAT FOR MOST PURPOSES,- ALTHOUGH FOR FINAL DETAIL WORK, A SMALL, SOFT, ROUND SEEMS TO WORK BEST FOR ME.------  THIS LEADS TO ISSUE OF BRUSH MATERIAL. HOG BRISTLE IS THE STANDARD, AND IT IS- FORTUNATELY FAIRLY CHEAP. THERE ARE ALSO SYNTHETIC BRUSHES THAT MIMIC THE- BEHAVIOR OF BRISTLE, AND THESE CAN BE CHEAPER STILL. THE KEY ATTRIBUTE OF THESE- BRUSHES IS THAT THEY ARE FAIRLY STIFF, ALLOWING THEM TO PICK UP AND MOVE THICK- PAINT EASILY. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO LAY NEW PAINT ON TOP OF AN- EXISTING LAYER OF WET PAINT, YOU OFTEN WANT A SOFTER BRUSH THAT WILL NOT DISTURB- THE EXISTING LAYERS AS MUCH. SABLE IS ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL CHOICES HERE, BUT- IT IS EXPENSIVE, SO SYNTHETIC SABLE SUBSTITUTES ARE A GOOD CHOICE FOR THIS- PURPOSE.------  A GIVEN BRUSH COMPANY WILL OFFER A LINE OF BRUSHES IN A GIVEN MATERIAL OF A- GIVEN QUALITY, AND USUALLY OFFER SEVERAL SIZES OF EACH OF THE ABOVE SHAPES- WITHIN THAT LINE. THE SIZES ARE NUMBERED, BUT THE NUMBERING IS VERY INCONSISTENT- FROM BRAND TO BRAND. ABOUT ALL YOU CAN BE SURE OF IS THAT WITHIN A SHAPE WITHIN- A GIVEN LINE, HIGHER NUMBERS ARE BIGGER. BUT WHAT ONE COMPANY CALLS A #6 ROUND- MIGHT BE A #9 FROM ANOTHER COMPANY. AND EVEN WITHIN A SINGLE LINE, A #8 FILBERT- MIGHT BE MUCH LARGER THAN A #8 BRIGHT. SO IT IS UNFORTUNATELY DIFFICULT IF NOT- IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE ADVICE ON BRUSH SIZE.------  THE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE MOST EDUCATORS SEEM TO AGREE ON IS THAT YOU SHOULD- USE BIGGER BRUSHES THAN YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE THINK, TO AVOID GETTING TOO CAUGHT- UP IN DETAIL TOO SOON. I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THIS. WHEN I WORK ON AN 11X------14" CANVAS, MUCH OF MY PAINTING IS DONE WITH A FILBERT BRUSH THAT IS ALMOST AN INCH- WIDE, WHICH I ALTERNATE WITH A FLAT THAT IS ONLY A LITTLE SMALLER. AS I- PROGRESS, I START RELYING MORE ON A PAIR OF BRUSHES MAYBE HALF THAT SIZE. BUT- ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE A SMALL SOFT ROUND BRUSH - ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TIP OF THE- TAIL OF A MOUSE - THAT I RESERVE FOR FINAL DETAILS, MOST OF MY PAINTINGS DO NOT- REQUIRE THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL.------  MY RECOMMENDATION, THEN, IS TO HAVE A COUPLE OF RELATIVELY LARGE BRUSHES- - FROM MOST MANUFACTURERS, THIS MEANS NUMBERS IN THE TEENS - THAT YOU CAN SWITCH- BETWEEN (LIGHT AND DARK OR WARM AND COOL) FOR MUCH OF THE PAINTING. ALSO A- COUPLE OF MEDIUM SIZED ONES YOU CAN USE THE SAME WAY. AND IF YOU DO GET A BRUSH- NUMBERED 1 OR 0, DO NOT EXPECT TO USE IT MUCH.------  THE OTHER TOOLS TYPICALLY USED BY OIL PAINTERS ARE KNIVES. THESE ARE NOT- KNIVES IN THE SENSE OF BEING PARTICULARLY SHARP, BUT YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE- ALLOWED TO TAKE THEM ON AN AIRPLANE. THERE ARE PALETTE KNIVES AND PAINTING- KNIVES, AND SOME PEOPLE MAINTAIN THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM,- BUT OTHERS DO NOT BOTHER, AND INSTEAD SIMPLY NOTE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT- SHAPES OF KNIVES AVAILABLE. THEY CAN BE MADE OF METAL, USUALLY WITH A WOODEN- HANDLE, OR PLASTIC.------  KNIVES ARE USED FOR THREE PURPOSES: TO MIX PAINT ON YOUR PALETTE BEFORE- APPLYING IT, TO APPLY PAINT (AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO USING A BRUSH), AND TO SCRAPE- OFF YOUR PALETTE WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED PAINTING. THE LATTER USE IS PROBABLY THE- ONLY ONE THAT PRETTY MUCH REQUIRES A KNIFE, OR SOME SORT OF SCRAPING DEVICE. A- LONG FLAT KNIFE IS BEST FOR THIS. USING A KNIFE FOR MIXING COLORS IS NOT- STRICTLY NECESSARY, AS YOU CAN DO THIS WITH A BRUSH AS WELL. BUT IT IS EASIER TO- WIPE OFF A KNIFE, AND THEREFORE EASIER TO MIX CLEAN COLORS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  USING A KNIFE TO APPLY PAINT TO CANVAS IS SOMETHING THAT A FEW ARTISTS DO A LOT - SOME- TO THE POINT OF NOT USING BRUSHES. OTHERS-NEVER USE A KNIFE FOR THIS PURPOSE.- OTHERS USE THE KNIFE THIS WAY ON OCCASION FOR THE EFFECTS IT CAN PRODUCE. IT IS- EASIER TO LAY CLEAN COLOR ON TOP OF EXISTING WET PAINT WITH A KNIFE THAN WITH A- BRUSH. A KNIFE STROKE LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM A BRUSH STROKE, SO IF YOU DO MIX- BRUSH AND KNIFE WORK IN A PAINTING, IT PAYS TO BE AWARE OF THIS, SO YOU DO NOT- HAVE SOME PASSAGES THAT STAND OUT AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE REST IF THAT IS- NOT YOUR INTENTION. BUT THAT MIGHT BE EXACTLY THE EFFECT YOU WANT.---------------------------  MAKING MARKS-------  THIS LEADS DIRECTLY INTO THE MATTER OF HOW WE APPLY PAINT TO THE CANVAS. OIL- PAINTERS TEND TO-USE ONE OF A HANDFUL OF BASIC APPROACHES TO PAINTING, AND THE- APPROACH YOU CHOOSE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE TECHNIQUES YOU WILL USE.------  THE APPROACH I AM MOST FAMILIAR WITH IS CALLED--- ALLA PRIMA---- PAINTING,- WHICH BASICALLY MEANS COMPLETING A PAINTING IN ONE SESSION. WITH OIL PAINT, THAT- MEANS THE PAINT IS ALWAYS WET, SO IF YOU EVER NEED TO PUT ONE COLOR OVER ANOTHER- - AND I DO THIS ALL THE TIME - YOU ARE WORKING WET INTO WET. THE CHALLENGE HERE- IS AVOID HAVING THE LAYER UNDERNEATH MUDDY UP THE LAYER ON TOP. ONE WAY TO DO- THIS IS TO APPLY THE FIRST LAYERS SPARINGLY - EITHER USING A MOSTLY DRY BRUSH- WITH LITTLE PAINT ON IT, OR BY SO DILUTING THE PAINT WITH SOLVENT (NOT OIL!)- THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY DRY IN JUST A FEW-MINUTES. IF YOU NEED TO LAYER PAINT ON- TOP OF THICKER-PAINT THAN-THIS, YOU CAN USE A MEDIUM SUCH AS OIL TO MAKE THE TOP- LAYERS MORE FLUID, WHICH CAN HELP-IT STAY ON-TOP. YOU MAY ALSO FIND EITHER- SOFTER BRUSHES OR A KNIFE CAN MAKE APPLYING PAINT ON TOP OF WET PAINT EASIER.- BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER SIMPLY EXPECTING SOME MIXING OF LAYERS TO OCCUR,- AND IN FACT TO DEPEND ON IT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE FIRST LAYER IS RED, AND YOU- WANT IT TO BE MORE ORANGE, INSTEAD OF MIXING UP JUST THE RIGHT ORANGE AND TRYING- TO LAY IT ON TOP WITHOUT MIXING, TRY SIMPLY LAYING SOME YELLOW ON TOP AND DOING- THE MIXING ON THE CANVAS. THIS APPROACH WORKS IF THE COLORS ARE RELATED, SO THE- COROLLARY TO THIS IS, TRY TO AVOID PUTTING DOWN COLOR THAT IS UNRELATED TO WHAT- YOU WANT THE FINAL COLOR TO BE. IF YOU HAVE TO DO THIS, PUT IT DOWN AS SPARINGLY- AS POSSIBLE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ALLA PRIMA PAINTING IS THE NORM FOR PLEIN AIR PAINTERS. STUDIO PAINTERS MAY- WORK ALLA PRIMA, BUT AT LEAST AS MANY PREFER TO WORKING IN LAYERS. THIS MEANS- PAINTING ONE LAYER AND LETTING IT DRY BEFORE WORKING THE NEXT. WHILE ONE CAN- APPROACH THIS AS SIMPLY ALLA PRIMA PAINTING THAT HAS BEEN SLOWED DOWN, AND WITH- LESS WORRY ABOUT LAYERS MUDDYING EACH OTHER, THE TRADITIONAL REASON FOR WORKING- IN LAYERS IS TO USE THE TECHNIQUE OF--- GLAZING----. THIS INVOLVES BUILDING UP- COLORS THROUGH LAYERS OF TRANSPARENT PAINT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAD A RED AREA- YOU WANTED ORANGE, YOU WOULD FIRST ALLOW THE RED AREA TO DRY------ - POSSIBLY A- MATTER OF DAYS. THEN YOU WOULD MIX YOUR YELLOW PAINT WITH A SPECIAL GLAZING- MEDIUM TO MAKE IT FLUID AND TRANSPARENT, AND ADD A THIN LAYER ON TOP OF THE RED.- THE RESULT WOULD BE AN ORANGE WITH A DIFFERENT LOOK THAT YOU WOULD GET IF YOU- SIMPLY MIXED THE RED AND YELLOW.------  WHEN WORKING IN LAYERS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HONOR THE FAT OVER LEAN RULE. A- LEAN LAYER HAS RELATIVELY LITTLE OIL - EITHER BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE PAINT- PERIOD, OR BECAUSE THE OIL PAINT HAS BEEN DILUTED WITH SOLVENT.-FAT LAYERS-ARE- PAINTS APPLIED FULL STRENGTH FROM THE TUBE, OR APPLIED WITH THE ADDITION OF A- MEDIUM CONTAINS YET-MORE OIL. THE LEAN LAYERS BELOW WILL DRY FASTER THAN THE FAT- ONES-ON TOP, WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT.-IF YOU PAINTED A LEAN LAYER OVER A FAT ONE,- THE FAT LAYER WOULD NOT ACTUALLY HAVE COMPLETELY CURED YET, AND THE NEW LEAN- LAYER WOULD ACTUALLY CURE BEFORE THE FAT ONE UNDERNEATH EVER FINISHED. AS THE- FAT LAYER CONTINUED TO CURE, IT WOULD TEND TO CAUSE THE ALREADY DRY-LEAN LAYER--ABOVE IT TO CRACK.------  SO, ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED ON A BASIC APPROACH, IT IS-FINALLY TIME TO ACTUALLY- PICK UP THE BRUSH. EVERY ARTIST HAS THEIR OWN TECHNIQUE HERE, BUT THE BASIC- ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS USUALLY SIMILAR.--------THE FIRST STEP IS TO MAKE SURE THE BRUSH YOU ARE USING IS CLEAN ENOUGH. I- FIND A GOOD WIPE WITH A-PAPER TOWEL IS OFTEN ENOUGH, BUT-FOR A MORE-THOROUGH- CLEANING, YOU CAN SWIRL-------THE BRUSH IN SOLVENT OR OIL FIRST.------  YOU CAN USE A KNIFE TO PREMIX THE COLOR YOU WANT TO APPLY IF YOU LIKE, BUT IN- MANY CASES IT WORKS AS WELL TO SIMPLY GRAB SOME PAINT WITH YOUR BRUSH, MOVE IT- TO A CLEAN AREA OF YOUR PALETTE, AND THEN TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME BRUSH- AND GRAB A BIT OF ANOTHER COLOR TO MIX IN. IT IS USUALLY WISE TO START BY- GUESSING WHICH COLOR YOU WILL NEED MORE OF IN THE MIX AND START WITH A GOOD- QUANTITY OF IT, THEN ADD THE LESSER COLOR JUST A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME UNTIL THE- COLOR IS RIGHT. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL TEND TO OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE LESSER- COLOR YOU NEED TO START WITH, AND IT WILL TAKE A WHOLE TUBE OF THE DOMINANT- COLOR TO GET THE MIXTURE RIGHT.------  ONCE YOU HAVE A MIXTURE, DIP YOUR BRUSH IN, AND STROKE THE CANVAS. THAT IS- THE EASY PART! DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH PAINT YOU LOADED, YOU CAN KEEP STROKING ON- A DRY CANVAS UNTIL THE PAINT ON THE BRUSH IS GONE. IF THERE WAS ALREADY A LAYER- OF WET PAINT ON THE CANVAS, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT GET JUST A COUPLE OF NEW STROKES- BEFORE YOU NEED TO WIPE THE BRUSH OFF AND GET FRESH PAINT - EACH STROKE IS- LIKELY TO PICK UP AS MUCH OLD WET PAINT AS IT DEPOSITS NEW PAINT. THE- WORKAROUNDS OF USING A MEDIUM TO MAKE THE TOP LAYERS MORE FLUID OR USING A- SOFTER BRUSH MIGHT GAIN YOU A COUPLE OF EXTRA STROKES AT MOST.------  THAT IS THE BASIC CYCLE. WHEN YOU ARE DONE APPLYING A GIVEN COLOR, YOU CLEAN- YOUR BRUSH - AGAIN, A SIMPLE WIPE MAY BE SUFFICIENT - AND START AGAIN. OR SWITCH- TO A DIFFERENT BRUSH IF YOU ARE CHANGING COLORS DRASTICALLY AND WANT TO LESSEN- THE RISK OF CREATING MUDDY MIXTURES.------  WHEN YOU ARE DONE PAINTING FOR THE DAY, BRUSHES WILL USUALLY NEED A MORE- THOROUGH CLEANING, OR THE PAINT LEFT IN THEM WILL DRY AND RUIN THE BRUSH. THIS- MEANS A LONGER SWIRL IN THE SOLVENT OR OIL, PERHAPS WORKING THE BRUSH ON THE- PALETTE TO REMOVE THE PAINT FURTHER, WIPING THE BRUSH WELL, AND POSSIBLY- REPEATING THIS WHOLE PROCESS. YOU SHOULD ALSO SCRAPE THE MIXTURES OFF YOUR- PALETTE, ALTHOUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE ORIGINAL BLOBS YOU SQUEEZED OUT ALONG THE- EDGES CAN OFTEN BE LEFT ALONE AND REUSED FOR A FEW DAYS.------------------------  MY PALETTE--------  I STARTED OFF USING THE SO-CALLED SPLIT PRIMARY PALETTE - A WARM AND COOL- VARIANT OF EACH PRIMARY - PLUS BURNT SIENNA AND OF COURSE WHITE. I NEVER FELT- LIMITED BY THIS, BUT I BEGAN TO NOTICE A FEW THINGS. I ALMOST NEVER USED THE- BURNT SIENNA. AND EVENTUALLY I CAME TO REALIZE THAT I WAS TENDING TO CHOOSE ONE- OF EACH PRIMARY FOR A GIVEN PAINTING, AND THEN TO STICK WITH IT. THAT IS, WHILE- I HAD TWO REDS, IF I USED THE WARM ONE FOR ONE THING IN THE PAINTING, I WOULD- TEND TO WANT TO USE THAT SAME RED ANYWHERE I NEEDED RED, TO AID COLOR HARMONY.- AND THIS DID NOT REALLY INTRODUCE ANY MAJOR HARDSHIP. IT IS TRUE THAT MIXING A- GOOD ORANGE WAS A LITTLE TRICKIER IF I WAS USING THE-COOL RED AND YELLOW INSTEAD- OF THE WARM, BUT I FOUND I COULD PRODUCE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE RESULTS BY SIMPLY- MAKING SURE I STARTED WITH A CLEAN BRUSH OR PALETTE KNIFE.-------  SO I STARTED USING JUST A NEUTRAL YELLOW, A COOL RED, AND ULTRAMARINE BLUE. I- LIKED THE ULTRAMARINE BECAUSE I LIKE INTENSE VIOLETS AND DULL GREENS IN MY- LANDSCAPES, AND ULTRAMARINE LENDS ITSELF WELL TO BOTH. EVERY SO OFTEN I WOULD- FIND THE NEED TO HAVE A MORE INTENSE GREEN THAN I COULD MIX THIS WAY, SO I ADDED- AN INTENSE GREEN TO MY PALETTE. IT ALSO HELPS ME GET MORE REALISTIC SKY COLOR- WHEN MIXED WITH ULTRAMARINE BLUE. FOR A WHILE I WAS STILL THINKING MIXING- ORANGES WERE A PROBLEM, SO I PUT THE WARM RED BACK ON IN MY KIT. I WOULD DECIDE- WHICH RED TO USE FOR ANY GIVEN PAINTING BEFORE STARTING. USUALLY, IT WAS THE- WARM RED FOR SUNNY DAYS AND THE COOL FOR OVERCAST ONES, OR SUNNY DAYS WHERE I- NEEDED ESPECIALLY INTENSE VIOLETS. I HAVE FOUND THE WARM RED I HAVE (NAPHTHOL)- - IS VERSATILE ENOUGH THAT I ALMOST NEVER-CHOOSE-THE COOL ONE (QUINACRIDONE ROSE)- ANY MORE. BUT REALISTICALLY, I HAVE FOUND THAT THE QUINACRIDONE IS PRETTY- VERSATILE, TOO.-------  SO MY BASIC PALETTE NOW CONSISTS OF---------------  AZO / ARYLIDE YELLOW (A MIXTURE)----------  NAPHTHOL RED----------  ULTRAMARINE BLUE----------  PHTHALO GREEN----------  TITANIUM WHITE----------  QUINACRIDONE ROSE - JUST IN CASE-------------  AS IT HAPPENS, THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PALETTE PREFERRED BY A NUMBER OF- OTHER MORE WELL-KNOWN LANDSCAPE PAINTERS, INCLUDING SCOTT CHRISTIANSEN AND KEVIN- MACPHERSON. I DO NOT THINK SCOTT USES OR RECOMMENDS THE PHTHALO GREEN, BUT I- FIND IT A USEFUL ADDITION FOR THE REASONS I MENTIONED. SCOTT MENTIONS USE A RED- LIKE NAPHTHOL WHILE KEVIN MENTIONS ONE MORE LIKE QUINACRIDONE ROSE, BUT AGAIN, I- FIND EITHER WORKS PRETTY WELL.-------  THIS PALETTE IS ADMITTEDLY OPTIMIZED FOR LANDSCAPE WORK, BUT I HAVE USED IT- FOR PORTRAITS AND FIGURES AND BEEN JUST AS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. SOME PEOPLE- CANNOT IMAGINE NOT HAVING EARTH TONES OR COLORS THAT MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE SKIN- ON THEIR PALETTES, BUT WITH A PALETTE THAT OFFERS SO FEW CHOICES, IT IS EASY- ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COLORS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO MIX ANY OTHER COLOR YOU- WANT. IT IS JUST A MATTER OF HOW MUCH OF EACH TO USE, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH- EXPERIMENTATION TO FIGURE-THAT OUT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
