IT'S AN EXCERPT FROM 48 RUTGERS LAW-REVIEW 397, 448-468, ANIMAL RIGHTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE- COPYRIGHT 1995 BY-GARY L. FRANCIONE. PORTIONS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE TAKEN FROM THE BOOK RAIN-WITHOUT THUNDER. FOOTNOTES ARE OMITTED.-------  CRITERION #1: AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE MUST CONSTITUTE A PROHIBITION-------  ...THUS THE FIRST CRITERION FOR ANY INCREMENTAL CHANGE, BEYOND THE-INCREMENTAL EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEED TO ABOLISH-INSTITUTIONALIZED ANIMAL EXPLOITATION, IS-THAT IT MUST PROHIBIT SOME-REASONABLY IDENTIFIABLE BEHAVIOR. THIS PROHIBITION MUST ALSO CORRELATE WITH-THE ABILITY OF THE ANIMAL TO CLAIM (THROUGH A REPRESENTATIVE) THE PROTECTION-OF THE RIGHT.-------  THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A PROHIBITION, AND NOT MERELY A REGULATION-THAT REQUIRES "HUMANE" TREATMENT, IS SOMETIMES PHRASED AS REQUIRING THE-"ABOLITION" OF A PARTICULAR PRACTICE. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A CORRECT DESCRIPTION-OF THE MATTER, IT CAN CAUSE CONFUSION BY EQUATING THE ABOLITION OF-INSTITUTIONALIZED ANIMAL EXPLOITATION WITH INCREMENTAL MEASURES THAT, IT IS-HOPED, WILL LEAD TO THAT ABOLITION. ON THE FIRST LEVEL OF MORAL THEORY,-ANIMAL RIGHTS THEORY IS CLEARLY "ABOLITIONIST" IN THAT ITS LONG-TERM GOAL IS-THE COMPLETE ERADICATION OF INSTITUTIONALIZED ANIMAL EXPLOITATION. WHAT WE-ARE EXAMINING NOW IS WHETHER THERE ARE ADEQUATE CRITERIA THAT CAN BE USED TO-IDENTIFY INCREMENTAL MEANS TO THE LONG-TERM GOAL.-------  TO SAY THAT THE INCREMENTAL MEANS MUST THEMSELVES BE "ABOLITIONIST" IS-CORRECT IF THE DEFINITION INCLUDES PROHIBITIONS AGAINST REASONABLY-IDENTIFIABLE CONDUCT WHICH, IF ENGAGED IN, WOULD CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO-RESPECT A PARTICULAR ANIMAL INTEREST. BUT THESE INCREMENTAL MEANS ARE BY-DEFINITION NOT "ABOLITIONIST" IN THE SENSE THAT NO ONE INCREMENTAL-PROHIBITION WILL EFFECT THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF ENDING ANIMAL SLAVERY. IN-ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION, IT IS BETTER TO RESERVE THE USE-OF "ABOLITION" FOR-THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF RIGHTS THEORY, AND "PROHIBITION" AS ONE CRITERION OF-INCREMENTAL MEASURES THAT SEEK TO REALIZE THAT LONG-TERM GOAL....-------  CRITERION #2: THERE MUST BE A PROHIBITION OF AN IDENTIFIABLE ACTIVITY THAT-IS CONSTITUTIVE OF THE EXPLOITATIVE INSTITUTION---  CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS:---  PROPOSAL 1: REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HENS CONFINED IN A BATTERY CAGE (USUALLY-FLOOR SPACE IS A TWELVE INCH SQUARE) FROM FOUR HENS TO THREE HENS.---  PROPOSAL 2: CRIMINALIZE THE USE OF ANIMALS IN DRUG ADDICTION EXPERIMENTS.---  THESE PROPOSALS CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED USING THE FIRST CRITERION ALONE,-BECAUSE, FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, BOTH OF THESE CAN BE CONSIDERED TO-INVOLVE PROHIBITIONS. ALTHOUGH PROPOSAL 2 ACCORDS MORE-WITH THE NOTION OF A-PROHIBITION, PROPOSAL 1 CAN BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS A PROHIBITION ON KEEPING-FOUR CHICKENS IN A CAGE.-------  THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE NO DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN PROPOSAL-1 AND PROPOSAL--- WITH RESPECT TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE USE OF ANIMALS-IN A CERTAIN TYPE OF EXPERIMENT, A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY THAT IS CONSTITUTIVE-OF THE GENERAL PRACTICE OF VIVISECTION HAS BEEN STOPPED.-------  ...[E]VEN IF THE ELIMINATION OF THE BATTERY CAGE AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE-SMALL HEN HOUSE CONSTITUTE A PROHIBITION OF AN ACTIVITY (I.E., THE USE-OF-THE BATTERY CAGE), THAT PROPOSAL IMPLICATES THE PROBLEM THAT THE CHANGE-NEVERTHELESS CONTINUES TO SANCTION THE EXPLOITATION OF THE HENS, ALBEIT IN A-DIFFERENT FORM.-------  CRITERION #3: THE PROHIBITION OF A CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY MUST RECOGNIZE AND-RESPECT A NON-INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL INTEREST-------  ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY OVER WHETHER ANIMALS CAN BE SAID TO HAVE-"INTERESTS," AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE, FOR GOOD REASONS, MOST PEOPLE,-INCLUDING THOSE WHO EXPLOIT ANIMALS, REGARD NONHUMANS-AS HAVING A WIDE RANGE-OF INTERESTS. THE LAW SUPPOSEDLY PROTECTS ANIMAL INTERESTS. THE PROBLEM IS-THAT FOR THE MOST PART, THESE INTERESTS ARE THOSE THAT FACILITATE THE-EXPLOITATION OF ANIMALS FOR A PARTICULAR PROPERTY USE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LAW-PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF ANIMALS USED IN EXPERIMENTS TO THE EXTENT-NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE ANIMAL PRODUCES DATA OF THE QUALITY CONSIDERED-ACCEPTABLE BY-RESEARCH SCIENTISTS.-INDEED, THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE USE OF-ANIMALS IN EXPERIMENTS ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT "ONLY THOSE ANIMALS THAT ARE-CARED FOR PROPERLY WILL BE GOOD RESEARCH SUBJECTS,-" AND THAT THE FEDERAL-ANIMAL WELFARE ACT AND OTHER SOURCES OF-REGULATION PROVIDE FOR THE REQUISITE-CARE. IN-THIS SENSE, EACH FORM OF INSTITUTIONALIZED EXPLOITATION WILL HAVE-RULES ABOUT THE "HUMANE" CARE OF ANIMALS THAT ARE TAILORED TO THAT-PARTICULAR USE OF-ANIMAL PROPERTY AND THAT REFLECT THE PARTICULAR CONCERNS-OF THAT EXPLOITATIVE ACTIVITY.-------  TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SEEK THE INCREMENTAL ERADICATION OF THE PROPERTY-STATUS OF ANIMALS, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THERE IS A-CORRESPONDING RECOGNITION-OF THE INTERESTS OF ANIMALS IN NOT BEING REGARDED-AS PROPERTY, OR, AS REGAN-WOULD SAY, IN NOT BEING TREATED EXCLUSIVELY AS A MEANS TO HUMAN ENDS. ...TO-ERADICATE THE PROPERTY-STATUS OF ANIMALS, THERE MUST BE A RECOGNITION OF AN-INTEREST THAT IS NONINSTITUTIONAL, OR THAT IS NOT SIMPLY AN INTEREST THAT-ENSURES THE ANIMAL IS-USED "WISELY" IN A CONTEXT OF EXPLOITATION. IT IS ONLY-THROUGH RECOGNITION-OF EXTRA OR NONINSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS THAT INCREMENTAL-ERADICATION OF PROPERTY STATUS CAN BE ACHIEVED; RECOGNITION OF INSTITUTIONAL-INTERESTS, SUCH AS THE INTEREST OF A TURKEY DESTINED FOR SLAUGHTER IN BEING-FED, MERELY REINFORCES-AND SUPPORTS THE PROPERTY STATUS OF ANIMALS. ...-------  CRITERION #4: ANIMAL INTERESTS CANNOT BE "TRADABLE-------"  ...IF THERE IS TO BE AN INCREMENTAL ERADICATION OF THE PROPERTY STATUS OF-ANIMALS, THEN THERE MUST BE A RECOGNITION THAT ANIMALS HAVE INTERESTS THAT-GO BEYOND THOSE INTERESTS THAT-MUST BE RESPECTED IF-WE ARE TO EXPLOIT-ANIMALS EFFICIENTLY. AND, FOLLOWING THE SECOND SALIENT ASSUMPTION OF ANIMAL-RIGHTS THEORY, THESE NON-INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS CANNOT BE TRADABLE JUST-BECAUSE THE AGGREGATION OF CONSEQUENCES INDICATES THAT THE TRADE IS-JUSTIFIED TO SECURE THE HUMAN "BENEFIT.--INDEED, ANIMALS ARE PROPERTY-PRECISELY BECAUSE ANIMALS HAVE NO INTERESTS (BEYOND THOSE THAT MUST BE-OBSERVED IF-THE ANIMALS ARE TO SERVE THEIR "PURPOSE" AS OUR PROPERTY) THAT-ARE SAFE FROM BEING BALANCED AWAY AS SOON AS SOME HUMAN "BENEFIT" IS-IDENTIFIED.-------  IN ONE SENSE, THIS CRITERION SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE INCREMENTAL-ERADICATION OF PROPERTY STATUS IS INDEED AN INCREMENTAL "ASSEMBLY" OF-PERSONHOOD STATUS FOR NONHUMANS THROUGH THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT-VALUE OF ANIMALS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE ANIMALS AS HAVING ANY-VALUE EXCEPT FOR THEIR VALUE TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, PHILOSOPHER JOSEPH RAZ-CLAIMS THAT ALTHOUGH ANIMALS MAY HAVE SOME VALUE APART FROM THEIR-INSTRUMENTAL USE TO PEOPLE, ANIMALS CANNOT HAVE INHERENT VALUE BECAUSE ANY-VALUE OF THE ANIMAL ULTIMATELY DERIVES FROM THE ANIMAL'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE-HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING OF-SOME HUMAN OR HUMANS, WHO DO HAVE INHERENT-VALUE.- RAZ'S VIEWS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY PEOPLE'S VIEWS. THE FOURTH-CRITERION ENSURES THAT EACH INCREMENTAL MOVE PROVIDES FOR AND PROTECTS SOME-NOTION OF THE INHERENT VALUE OF ANIMALS.-------  IN ONE SENSE, THIS CRITERION COULD BE SAID TO ADDRESS THE ENFORCEABILITY OF-PROTECTION FOR RECOGNIZED INTERESTS. ONE COULD SAY THAT UNDER SLAVERY AS-PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE WERE SOME LAWS THAT SEEMED TO-RECOGNIZE THAT SLAVES HAD INTERESTS OTHER THAN ONES DIRECTLY RELATED TO-KEEPING A SLAVE ALIVE AND FIT FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE THE SLAVE WAS INTENDED.-FOR THE MOST PART, HOWEVER, THESE INTERESTS WERE IGNORED WHENEVER THEY-CONFLICTED WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE MASTER WHOSE PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE HELD-TO OUTWEIGH THE SLAVE'S INTERESTS. IF ANIMAL INTERESTS ARE TO BE TAKEN-SERIOUSLY, THEN, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW REGULATES THE USE OF ANIMAL-PROPERTY BEYOND-WHAT IS NECESSARY TO-EXPLOIT THE ANIMAL PROPERTY, THAT-REGULATION MUST BE HELD AS ELIMINATING THE PROPERTY RIGHT TO THE EXTENT-NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE INTEREST. OTHERWISE, THE VICTORY FOR ANIMALS WILL-BE ILLUSORY; AS SOON AS THE RIGHTS OF HUMAN PROPERTY OWNERS ARE TRIGGERED,-THE ANIMAL INTEREST WILL BE IGNORED.-------  ACCORDINGLY, THE INTEREST OF THE ANIMAL MUST-BE SEEN EXPLICITLY AS-AN-INTEREST THAT IS TO BE PROTECTED AS WOULD A TRUE "RIGHT" WITHIN THE LEGAL-SYSTEM. THE INTEREST WOULD NOT BE A-"RIGHT" IN THE FULL SENSE IN THAT SINCE-ANIMALS WOULD NOT YET POSSESS THE BASIC RIGHT NOT TO BE REGARDED AS PROPERTY-(THEY WOULD STILL BE USED FOR FOOD AND IN EXPERIMENTS), THEY WOULD HAVE-NONBASIC RIGHTS THAT COULD BE SAID TO BE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE BASIC RIGHT-NOT TO BE PROPERTY. THESE NONBASIC RIGHTS MUST, HOWEVER, BE TREATED AS-THOUGH THEY WERE RIGHTS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE REGARDED AS-PROTECTING INTERESTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO INTEREST BALANCING.-------  TO PROTECT ANIMAL INTERESTS IN THIS MANNER WOULD REQUIRE A VERY DELIBERATE-AND INTENTIONAL RECOGNITION OF A TYPE OF LEGAL NORM THAT OUR LEGAL SYSTEM-DOES NOT YET RECOGNIZE: A NORM THAT FUNCTIONS LIKE A TRUE RIGHT IN THAT IT-RECOGNIZES AN INTEREST THAT CANNOT BE BALANCED AWAY, BUT THAT IS HELD BY A-BEING WHO HAS NOT YET ACHIEVED THE STATUS OF BEING A HOLDER OF THE BASIC-RIGHT NOT TO BE REGARDED EXCLUSIVELY AS A MEANS TO AN END. INDEED, EVERY-TIME WE RECOGNIZE SUCH A RIGHT, WE MOVE AWAY FROM TREATING THE BEING-EXCLUSIVELY AS A MEANS TO HUMAN ENDS; THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BEING'S MOST-FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS IN NOT BEING EATEN OR USED IN EXPERIMENTS OR KEPT IN A-ZOO HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECOGNIZED. THESE INCREMENTAL MEASURES MAY BE SEEN,-HOWEVER, AS RECOGNIZING PIECES OF THE BASIC RIGHT NOT TO BE REGARDED AS-PROPERTY. SO, ALTHOUGH THESE INTERESTS REPRESENT NONBASIC RIGHTS IN ONE-SENSE (THE ANIMAL DOES NOT YET BY DEFINITION HAVE THE BASIC RIGHT OF NOT-BEING PROPERTY), THE INTERESTS ARE MORE PROPERLY REGARDED AS "PARTS" OF THE-BASIC RIGHT OF ANIMALS NOT TO BE TREATED EXCLUSIVELY AS MEANS TO HUMAN ENDS.-------  ..IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THAT ANIMALS HAVE SUCH INTERESTS, IT IS NECESSARY-THAT THESE INTERESTS BE UNDERSTOOD AS TRUMPING THE INTERESTS OF PROPERTY-OWNERS. AND IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE LEGAL-SYSTEM TO-RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS-ANIMALS WHO HOLD THIS INTEREST, AND NOT THEIR-OWNERS OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE USDA, WHICH PROTECTS ONLY-THOSE ANIMAL INTERESTS THAT MAKE ANIMALS PROPERTY IN THE FIRST-PLACE. IT-WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RECOGNIZE THAT ANIMALS (OR, MORE PROPERLY-SPEAKING, THE GUARDIANS OF ANIMALS) HAVE STANDING TO ARTICULATE THESE-INTERESTS AGAINST PROPERTY OWNERS, WHICH WOULD FUNCTIONALLY REQUIRE THAT-SOME SORT OF GUARDIAN BE RECOGNIZED.-------  BECAUSE ANIMALS ARE REGARDED AS PROPERTY, AND PROPERTY IS, BY DEFINITION AND-SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS OF ACCEPTED UNDERSTANDING, THAT WHICH CANNOT HAVE-LEGAL RELATIONS WITH PERSONS OR OTHER PROPERTY, COURTS HAVE DEVELOPED-DOCTRINES THAT PRECLUDE ANIMALS OR THEIR SURROGATES FROM ARTICULATING THEIR-INTERESTS IN COURTS OF LAW AND BEFORE REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS EXCLUSION IS-BASED ON THE SUPPOSED INABILITY (IN TERMS OF THE POWER OF THE COURT) TO-ADJUDICATE CLAIMS MADE BY PROPERTY OR THOSE WHO PURPORT TO REPRESENT THAT-PROPERTY. SO, IF THE ... NON-INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS OF ANIMALS ARE TO BE-NON-TRADABLE, THEN THOSE INTERESTS, WHICH MUST BE SEEN AS RECOGNIZING-"MINITRUMPS" OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANIMAL OWNERS, MUST-BE PROTECTED BY-THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS WILL REQUIRE-THAT ANIMAL INTERESTS HAVE LEGAL-STANDING AND THAT SOME HUMAN ACTOR (AND THIS COULD BE THE POLICE) HAVE-STANDING TO ARTICULATE THOSE CLAIMS BEFORE THE APPROPRIATE BODY. THIS IS, OF-COURSE, NOT A NEW IDEA. IN SHOULD TREES HAVE STANDING? -- TOWARD LEGAL-RIGHTS FOR NATURAL OBJECTS, CHRISTOPHER STONE ARGUED THAT THE INHERENT VALUE-OF NONHUMANS COULD BE RECOGNIZED AND PROTECTED BY GUARDIANS JUST AS ARE THE-RIGHTS-(BASIC RIGHTS AND NONBASIC RIGHTS) OF CHILDREN OR THE MENTALLY-DISABLED.-------  CRITERION #5: THE PROHIBITION SHOULD NOT SUBSTITUTE AN ALTERNATIVE, AND-SUPPOSEDLY MORE "HUMANE" FORM OF EXPLOITATION-------  THIS FIFTH CRITERION FOLLOWS FROM BOTH ASPECTS OF RIGHTS THEORY IDENTIFIED-AT THE OUTSET OF THIS SECTION: THAT RIGHTS THEORY REQUIRES ERADICATION OF-THE PROPERTY STATUS OF ANIMALS AND THAT THE RIGHT OF ANIMALS NOT TO BE-REGARDED AS PROPERTY CANNOT BE COMPROMISED FOR CONSEQUENTIAL REASONS. IN-MANY RESPECTS, THIS FIFTH CRITERION IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE GROUP-BECAUSE IT OFTEN WILL BE THE MOST HELPFUL IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PROPOSED-INCREMENTAL MEASURE IS CONSISTENT WITH RIGHTS THEORY, ALTHOUGH, LIKE THE-OTHER CRITERIA, THIS ONE IS NOT EXACT AND WILL NOT PROVIDE AN EASY ANSWER IN-ALL CASES. BUT THEN, THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO MAKE A MORALLY INFORMED DECISION,-AND NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT IS ALWAYS RIGHT.-------  THE FIFTH CRITERION HOLDS THAT IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH RIGHTS THEORY TO-TREAT SOME ANIMALS EXCLUSIVELY AS MEANS TO THE ENDS OF OTHERS, OR AS-PROPERTY, IN ORDER TO SECURE SOME BENEFIT THAT IT IS HOPED WILL EVENTUALLY-SECURE A HIGHER MORAL STATUS FOR OTHER ANIMALS. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM-FOR THE NEW WELFARIST WHO PURPORTS TO ENDORSE THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF ANIMAL-RIGHTS BY USING SHORT-TERM WELFARIST REFORMS AS A MEANS-TO THE END OF-ABOLITION OF INSTITUTIONALIZED EXPLOITATION.-------  THE NEW WELFARIST DISREGARDS THE INHERENT VALUE OF SOME ANIMALS IN ORDER TO-SECURE A BENEFIT FOR OTHER ANIMALS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL ANIMAL WELFARE-ACT PROVIDES THAT ANIMALS- MAY BE USED IN BIOMEDICAL EXPERIMENTS AS LONG AS-THEIR USE IS "HUMANE" AND THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO SUFFER "UNNECESSARILY." THE-NEW WELFARISTS, WHO SUPPORTED THE 1985 AMENDMENTS TO THE ACT, BELIEVE THAT-THE ACT WILL ITSELF REDUCE ANIMAL SUFFERING, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT LAWS-LIKE THE ACT ARE "STEPPING STONES" TO THE FUTURE RECOGNITION AND RESPECT OF-ANIMALS OTHER THAN THE ONES WHOSE INTERESTS ARE NOW BEING IGNORED. THIS-ARTICLE ARGUED EARLIER-THAT THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER LAWS-LIKE THE ACT ACTUALLY REDUCE ANIMAL SUFFERING, AND THAT, GIVEN THE-STRUCTURAL DEFECTS OF WELFARE THEORY GENERALLY, SUCH LAWS WILL GENERALLY BE-HELD ONLY TO REQUIRE THAT CONDUCT THAT FACILITATES THE USE OF THE ANIMAL AS-PROPERTY. APART FROM THE RATHER PUZZLING LOGIC OF HOW WE GET TO A-NON-PROPERTY STATUS OF ANIMALS BY PERSISTENT REINFORCEMENT OF THE PROPERTY-PARADIGM, THERE IS SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE ON A THEORETICAL LEVEL WHEN A-RIGHTS ADVOCATE EXPLICITLY ENDORSES THE PROPERTY STATUS OF ANIMALS AS A WAY-OF ERADICATING THAT STATUS ON AN INCREMENTAL BASIS.-------  ...SO, FOR EXAMPLE, A COMPLETE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CHIMPANZEES IN-CERTAIN PROCEDURES CAN REASONABLY BE SAID TO CONSTITUTE THE PROHIBITION OF A-CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY, BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADVOCATE URGES OR ACCEPTS-THAT OTHER ANIMALS,-SUCH AS DOGS, SHOULD-BE USED INSTEAD...SUCH A RULE WOULD-VIOLATE THE FUNDAMENTAL PROSCRIPTION AGAINST SPECIESISM.-----IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND MORE FULLY THE POINT OF THIS-FIFTH CRITERION,-CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:-ANIMAL ADVOCATES PROPOSE TO LOBBY FOR A LAW-THE PREAMBLE OF WHICH EXPLICITLY-RECOGNIZES THAT ANIMALS HAVE MORAL-INTERESTS AND THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF BATTERY HENS PER CAGE DISRESPECTS-THOSE MORAL INTERESTS. THE BODY OF THE LAW PROVIDES THAT IN RECOGNITION OF-THE INTERESTS THAT HENS HAVE, NO MORE THAN TWO SHALL BE PLACED IN BATTERY-CAGES, AND THESE CAGES SHALL BE ENLARGED TO PROVIDE 196 INCHES OF FLOORSPACE-RATHER THAN 144 INCHES. THE EGG INDUSTRY OBJECTS TO THIS ARRANGEMENT-VEHEMENTLY AS IT IS "UNNECESSARY" TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF ANIMAL PROPERTY-AND WILL, IN FACT, IMPOSE A VERY SIGNIFICANT COST ON THE OWNERSHIP OF ANIMAL-PROPERTY IN THIS CONTEXT. THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THIS INTEREST MUST BE-PROTECTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND CONTAINS PENALTIES-TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERESTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED SUBJECT TO COMPLETE-DEFEASANCE THROUGH A CLAIM OF HUMAN "BENEFIT.-------"  THE TRADITIONAL WELFARIST WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BECAUSE IT-WILL, IN THE WELFARIST'S VIEW, REDUCE ANIMAL SUFFERING. THE NEW WELFARIST,-WHO SEEKS AS A LONG-TERM GOAL THE ABOLITION OF ANIMAL EXPLOITATION, WILL-ALSO UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT THIS, NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WILL SUPPOSEDLY REDUCE-SUFFERING, BUT BECAUSE IT IS A "STEPPING STONE" OR "SPRINGBOARD" INTO-ABOLITION AT SOME FUTURE TIME. THE NEW WELFARIST AND THE TRADITIONAL-WELFARIST HAVE THE SAME VIEW -- THAT THE MEASURE WILL REDUCE SUFFERING- --BUT THE NEW WELFARIST, UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL WELFARIST, BELIEVES THAT-BECAUSE THE MEASURE WILL REDUCE SUFFERING, IT WILL ACT AS AN INCREMENTAL-MEASURE ON THE ROAD TO THE LONG-TERM GOAL.-------  THE ANIMAL RIGHTS ADVOCATE FIRST DISMISSES THE VIEW THAT AVOIDING PAIN AND-SUFFERING ARE THE ONLY INTERESTS THAT ANIMALS (HUMAN OR NONHUMAN) HAVE. IF-PAIN AND SUFFERING WERE THE ONLY RELEVANT MORAL INTERESTS, THEN WHAT WOULD-PREVENT US FROM USING SMALL NUMBERS OF "UNDESIRABLE" HUMANS TO ERADICATE-LARGE AMOUNTS OF HUMAN PAIN AND SUFFERING? OBVIOUSLY, ALTHOUGH WE ALL HAVE-STRONG INTERESTS IN AVOIDING PAIN AND SUFFERING, WE DO LIMIT THE WAYS IN-WHICH PAIN AND SUFFERING CAN BE ALLEVIATED SO AS TO RESPECT OTHER-INTERESTS -- SUCH AS THE RIGHTS OF HUMANS (AND NONHUMANS) -- AS WELL.-SECOND, THE RIGHTS ADVOCATE DISMISSES THE NEW WELFARIST VIEW, ALSO-ARTICULATED BY SINGER, THAT A MEASURE THAT REDUCES PAIN AND SUFFERING WILL-LEAD TO INCREMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF EQUAL CONSIDERATION-FOR EQUAL INTERESTS (SINGER) OR THE ABOLITION OF ALL INSTITUTIONALIZED-EXPLOITATION (REGAN) SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SUPPOSEDLY REDUCES PAIN AND-SUFFERING. THE RIGHTS ADVOCATE KNOWS THAT SOME MEASURES THAT SUPPOSEDLY-REDUCE PAIN AND SUFFERING WILL DO NOTHING MORE THAN ASSURE THAT ANIMALS-RECEIVE PROTECTION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR STATUS AS PROPERTY, AND-THAT FACILITATES THEIR USE AS PARTICULAR TYPES OF PROPERTY.-------  THE RIGHTS ADVOCATE BEGINS BY ASKING WHETHER THE PROPOSAL CONTAINS A-PROHIBITION OR A REGULATION, AND CONCLUDES THAT THE PROPOSAL PROHIBITS-KEEPING MORE THAN TWO HENS IN THE CAGE. SHE IS UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER, EVEN-IF THE PROPOSAL IS A PROHIBITION, IT CONSTITUTES A PROHIBITION OF AN-ACTIVITY THAT IS CONSTITUTIVE OF THE OVERALL FORM OF EXPLOITATION. SHE ERRS-IN FAVOR OF REGARDING THE MEASURE AS PROHIBITING A CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY.-SHE IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF AN-INTEREST THAT IS EXTRA-INSTITUTIONAL IN THAT IT PROVIDES FOR THE RECOGNITION-OF AN INTEREST THAT IS NOT TIED TO THE PROPERTY STATUS OF THE HENS. THE-PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT THE HENS HAVE INHERENT VALUE BEYOND THEIR STATUS AS-PROPERTY, WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY ONLY THAT LEVEL OF REGULATION THAT FACILITATED-ANIMAL USE. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES THAT THESE INTERESTS CANNOT BE-TRADED AWAY AND CONSTITUTE PROTO-RIGHTS.-------  THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IT IS, ON ITS FACE, NOT ONLY-CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUS OF ANIMALS AS PROPERTY THAT, AS A GENERAL MATTER,-LACKS INHERENT VALUE, BUT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT EXPLICITLY TRADES AWAY THE-BASIC RIGHT OF THE HENS NOT TO BE PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF A RECOGNITION OF-MORAL STATUS THAT FALLS SHORT OF RECOGNITION OF THE BASIC RIGHT, OR THE-COMPLETE PROTECTION OF SOME INTEREST THAT THE ANIMAL HAS IN, FOR EXAMPLE,-BODILY MOVEMENT. BY AGREEING TO THE TWO-HEN ARRANGEMENT, ANIMAL ADVOCATES-ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE PROTO-RIGHTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENDORSING AN-ALTERNATIVE FORM OF EXPLOITATION -- TWO HENS IN A CAGE -- THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY-MORE "HUMANE.-------"  IN THE-PRESENT CASE, IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SAY THAT THE INTEREST INVOLVED-IS THE INTEREST THAT THE HENS HAVE -- ALL OF THEM -- IN NOT BEING IN THE-BATTERY CAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IN HAVING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT IS-APPROPRIATE TO THE SPECIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES AND-RESPECTS THAT INTEREST, THEN THE PROHIBITION ARGUABLY DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE-ANOTHER FORM OF EXPLOITATION AND IS ACCEPTABLE. THAT IS, ASSUME THAT A-PROHIBITION ABOLISHES THE BATTERY CAGE ENTIRELY-AND REPLACES IT WITH A-REARING SYSTEM THAT ACCOMMODATES ALL OF THE HEN'S INTERESTS IN FREEDOM OF-MOVEMENT AND THEREBY FULLY RECOGNIZES-THE INTEREST OF THE HEN'S BODILY-INTEGRITY. SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS MAY BE ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT THE-PROHIBITION ENDS A PARTICULAR FORM OF EXPLOITATION THAT HAS VIOLATED A-PARTICULAR NON-INSTITUTIONAL, NON-TRADABLE INTEREST THAT WE HAVE NOW DECIDED-TO RESPECT. BUT THIS SORT OF SUBSTITUTION DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY FROM MERELY-REMOVING TWO OF THE HENS FROM THE CAGE IN THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET-ABOLISHED THE INSTITUTIONALIZED EXPLOITATION, THE SUBSTITUTION ELIMINATES-THE EXPLOITATION INVOLVED IN THE CONFINEMENT SYSTEM THROUGH A FULL-RECOGNITION OF THE INTEREST OF THE HENS IN THEIR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT.-------  IN ANY EVENT, ANY SUBSTITUTION OF EXPLOITATION RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR-THE RIGHTS ADVOCATE. IF THE INCREMENTAL ERADICATION OF THE PROPERTY STATUS-OF ANIMALS IS GOING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH RIGHTS THEORY, IT IS IMPORTANT-THAT PROPOSED MEASURES NOT SUBSTITUTE ONE FORM OF EXPLOITATION FOR ANOTHER,-SUPPOSEDLY MORE "HUMANE" FORM OF EXPLOITATION. OFTENTIMES, THE ALTERNATIVE-FORM OF EXPLOITATION WILL PROVIDE IN GENERAL TERMS FOR "HUMANE" TREATMENT,-WHICH THEN FEEDS THE WHOLE MATTER RIGHT BACK THROUGH THE MECHANISMS OF LEGAL-WELFARISM WHICH, AS ARGUED BEFORE, ARE STRUCTURALLY DEFECTIVE AND-SYSTEMATICALLY DEVALUE ANIMAL INTERESTS. BUT EVEN IF THE SUBSTITUTE FORM OF-EXPLOITATION IS MORE DEFINITE (I.E., THERE SHALL BE NO MORE THAN TWO BIRDS-PER CAGE), AND EVEN IF THE PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT THE ANIMALS HAVE-SOME-INHERENT VALUE THAT JUSTIFIES THE RECOGNITION OF A NON-INSTITUTIONAL,-NON-TRADABLE INTEREST, THAT RECOGNITION COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF ENDORSING-ANOTHER FORM OF EXPLOITATION THAT RESTS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE STATUS OF-ANIMALS AS PROPERTY. THIS SACRIFICES THE MORAL RIGHT OF THE ANIMAL NOT TO BE-PROPERTY FOR A PROTO-RIGHT THAT IS DESIGNED TO EFFECT THE INCREMENTAL-ERADICATION OF PROPERTY-STATUS. THE SUBSTITUTION OF EXPLOITATION RAISES-ISSUES OF MORAL CONFLICT WITH RIGHTS THEORY, AND INCOHERENCE IN LIGHT OF THE-FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS OF THAT THEORY.-------  THIS DISCUSSION DOES SERVE, HOWEVER, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AS A PRACTICAL-MATTER, CERTAIN CAMPAIGNS WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES TO-PURSUE IF THEY AGREE WITH THIS FIFTH CRITERION. IT SEEMS THAT THE RIGHTS-ADVOCATE REALLY HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO CONDEMN ANY FORM-OF SUBSTITUTE-EXPLOITATION, UNLESS THAT ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT COMPLETELY ERADICATES AN-ACTIVITY CONSTITUTIVE OF ANIMAL EXPLOITATION THROUGH THE FULL RECOGNITION OF-RELEVANT ANIMAL INTERESTS. THE ANIMAL ADVOCATE MUST NOT HERSELF SUGGEST AN-ALTERNATIVE, AND MUST NOT AGREE TO ANY ALTERNATIVE OFFERED BY THE EXPLOITER.-TO DO EITHER WOULD INVOLVE THE RIGHTS ADVOCATE SACRIFICING THE BASIC RIGHT-OF ANIMALS NOT TO BE PROPERTY IN ORDER TO SECURE A LESS-THAN-BASIC-PROTO-RIGHT THAT, WHILE IT DOES RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT THAT ANIMALS HAVE-PERSON-LIKE INTERESTS THAT TRANSCEND THEIR STATUS AS PROPERTY, IS ACHIEVED-AT THE COST OF REINFORCING THE NOTION THAT A "BETTER" SYSTEM OF ANIMAL-SLAVERY IS ACCEPTABLE. THESE CONSIDERATIONS WOULD MILITATE IN FAVOR OF-CONDUCTING THE SORT OF CAMPAIGN THAT MAY NOT SUCCEED (AT LEAST INITIALLY),-BUT THAT WILL HAVE A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL EFFECT ON EDUCATING MEMBERS OF THE-PUBLIC-ABOUT ANIMAL EXPLOITATION. AND IN MANY-RESPECTS, SUCH EDUCATION,-WHETHER SOUGHT DIRECTLY-IN THE CLASSROOM OR AS PART OF A MILITANT CAMPAIGN-SUCH AS ONE THAT SUPPORTS A LAW TO DEMAND THE END OF THE EGG BATTERY AND-THAT URGES NO SUBSTITUTE FORM OF EXPLOITATION (RATHER THAN A REACTIONARY AND-CONSERVATIVE WELFARIST CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THE MATTERS MORE "HUMANE" FOR THE-HENS) IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING THAT THE ANIMAL RIGHTS ADVOCATE CAN DO AT-THIS STAGE OF HISTORY IN ANY EVENT.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
