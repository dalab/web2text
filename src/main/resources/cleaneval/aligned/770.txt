BUT, AS PET OWNERS CAN ATTEST,-TAKING-CARE OF THEM IS HARD------ WORK. ANIMAL CARETAKERS, SOMETIMES CALLED ANIMAL ATTENDANTS OR ANIMAL KEEPERS, FEED,------ WATER, GROOM, BATHE, AND EXERCISE ANIMALS-AND CLEAN, DISINFECT, AND REPAIR THEIR CAGES.------ THEY ALSO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS, PROVIDE COMPANIONSHIP, AND OBSERVE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES-------THAT COULD-INDICATE ILLNESS OR INJURY.---------------------- KENNELS, ANIMAL SHELTERS,-ANIMAL HOSPITALS AND CLINICS, STABLES, LABORATORIES, AQUARIUMS,------ AND ZOOLOGICAL PARKS ALL HOUSE ANIMALS AND EMPLOY CARETAKERS. JOB TITLES AND DUTIES VARY------ BY EMPLOYMENT SETTING.--------------------- KENNEL STAFF USUALLY CARE-FOR SMALL COMPANION ANIMALS LIKE DOGS AND CATS WHILE THEIR------ OWNERS ARE WORKING OR TRAVELING OUT OF TOWN. BEGINNING ATTENDANTS PERFORM BASIC TASKS,------ SUCH AS CLEANING CAGES AND DOG RUNS, FILLING FOOD AND WATER DISHES, AND EXERCISING------ ANIMALS. EXPERIENCED ATTENDANTS MAY PROVIDE BASIC ANIMAL HEALTH CARE, BATHE-AND GROOM------ ANIMALS, AND CLEAN THEIR EARS. CARETAKERS-WHO WORK IN KENNELS ALSO SELL PET FOOD AND------ SUPPLIES, ASSIST IN OBEDIENCE TRAINING, HELP WITH-BREEDING, OR PREPARE ANIMALS FOR------ SHIPPING.--------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN GROOMING, OR MAINTAINING A PET'S------USUALLY A DOG'S------ OR CAT'S------APPEARANCE ARE CALLED GROOMERS. SOME GROOMERS WORK IN KENNELS AND OTHERS------ OPERATE THEIR OWN GROOMING BUSINESS. GROOMERS ANSWER TELEPHONES, SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS,------ DISCUSS WITH CLIENTS HOW THEY WANT THEIR PETS TO LOOK, AND COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE------ PET'S DISPOSITION AND VETERINARIAN. GROOMING THE PET INVOLVES SEVERAL STEPS: AN INITIAL------ BRUSH-OUT IS FOLLOWED BY A FIRST CLIPPING OF HAIR OR FUR USING ELECTRIC CLIPPERS, COMBS,------ AND GROOMING SHEARS; THE GROOMER THEN CUTS THE NAILS, CLEANS-THE EARS, BATHES, AND------ BLOW-DRIES THE ANIMAL, AND ENDS WITH-A FINAL CLIPPING AND STYLING.---------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN ANIMAL SHELTERS PERFORM A-VARIETY OF-DUTIES AND WORK WITH A WIDE------ VARIETY OF ANIMALS. IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING TO THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE ANIMALS, CARETAKERS------ MUST-ALSO KEEP RECORDS OF THE-ANIMALS RECEIVED-AND DISCHARGED AND ANY TESTS OR TREATMENTS-------DONE. SOME-VACCINATE NEWLY ADMITTED ANIMALS UNDER THE-DIRECTION OF-A VETERINARIAN, AND------ EUTHANIZE (PUT TO DEATH) SERIOUSLY ILL, SEVERELY INJURED,-OR UNWANTED ANIMALS. CARETAKERS------ IN ANIMAL SHELTERS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC,-ANSWERING TELEPHONE INQUIRIES, SCREENING------ APPLICANTS FOR ANIMAL ADOPTION, OR EDUCATING VISITORS ON NEUTERING AND OTHER ANIMAL HEALTH------ ISSUES.---------------------- WORKERS IN STABLES SADDLE AND UNSADDLE HORSES, GIVE THEM RUBDOWNS, AND WALK THEM THROUGH A------ COOL-OFF AFTER A RIDE. THEY ALSO FEED, GROOM, AND EXERCISE THE HORSES, CLEAN OUT STALLS------ AND REPLENISH BEDDING, POLISH SADDLES, CLEAN AND ORGANIZE THE TACK (HARNESS, SADDLE, AND------ BRIDLE) ROOM, AND STORE SUPPLIES AND FEED. EXPERIENCED STAFF MAY HELP TRAIN HORSES.--------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN ANIMAL HOSPITALS OR CLINICS ARE CALLED VETERINARY ASSISTANTS.------ VETERINARIANS RELY ON CARETAKERS TO KEEP A CONSTANT EYE ON THE CONDITION OF ANIMALS UNDER------ THEIR CHARGE. CARETAKERS WATCH AS ANIMALS RECOVER FROM SURGERY, CHECK WHETHER DRESSINGS------ ARE STILL ON CORRECTLY, OBSERVE THE ANIMALS' OVERALL ATTITUDE, AND NOTIFY A DOCTOR IF------ ANYTHING SEEMS OUT OF THE ORDINARY. WHILE AMONG THE ANIMALS, CARETAKERS CLEAN CONSTANTLY------ TO MAINTAIN SANITARY CONDITIONS IN THE HOSPITAL.--------------------- LABORATORY ANIMAL CARETAKERS WORK IN RESEARCH FACILITIES AND ASSIST WITH THE CARE OF A------ WIDE VARIETY OF ANIMALS, INCLUDING MICE, RATS, SHEEP, PIGS, CATTLE, DOGS, CATS, MONKEYS,------ BIRDS, FISH, AND FROGS. THEY FEED AND WATER THE ANIMALS, CLEAN CAGES AND CHANGE BEDDING,------ AND EXAMINE THE ANIMALS FOR SIGNS OF ILLNESS, DISEASE, OR INJURY. THEY MAY ADMINISTER------ MEDICATIONS ORALLY OR TOPICALLY ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS, PREPARE SAMPLES FOR LABORATORY------ EXAMINATION, STERILIZE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT, AND RECORD INFORMATION REGARDING GENEALOGY,------ DIET, WEIGHT, MEDICATIONS, AND FOOD INTAKE. THEY WORK WITH SCIENTISTS, PHYSICIANS,------ VETERINARIANS, AND LABORATORY TECHNICIANS.--------------------- IN ZOOS, CARETAKERS CALLED KEEPERS PREPARE THE DIETS AND CLEAN THE ENCLOSURES OF ANIMALS,------ AND SOMETIMES ASSIST IN RAISING THEIR WARDS. THEY WATCH FOR ANY SIGNS OF ILLNESS OR------ INJURY, MONITOR EATING PATTERNS OR ANY CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR, AND RECORD THEIR OBSERVATIONS.------ KEEPERS ALSO MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS AND ASSURE-THAT THE VISITING PUBLIC BEHAVES RESPONSIBLY------ TOWARD THE EXHIBITED ANIMALS. DEPENDING ON THE ZOO, KEEPERS MAY BE ASSIGNED TO WORK WITH A------ BROAD GROUP OF ANIMALS SUCH AS MAMMALS, BIRDS, OR REPTILES, OR THEY MAY WORK WITH A------ LIMITED COLLECTION OF ANIMALS SUCH AS PRIMATES, LARGE CATS, OR SMALL MAMMALS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WORKING CONDITIONS----------------------------------- PEOPLE WHO LOVE ANIMALS GET SATISFACTION FROM WORKING WITH AND HELPING ANIMALS.------ HOWEVER, SOME OF THE WORK MAY BE UNPLEASANT AND PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DEMANDING.------ CARETAKERS HAVE-TO CLEAN ANIMAL CAGES AND LIFT, HOLD, OR RESTRAIN ANIMALS, RISKING------ EXPOSURE TO BITES OR SCRATCHES. THEIR WORK OFTEN INVOLVES KNEELING, CRAWLING, REPEATED------ BENDING, AND-LIFTING HEAVY SUPPLIES LIKE BALES OF HAY OR BAGS OF FEED. ANIMAL CARETAKERS------ MUST TAKE PRECAUTIONS WHEN TREATING ANIMALS WITH GERMICIDES OR INSECTICIDES. THE WORK------ SETTING CAN BE NOISY. ANIMAL CARETAKERS WHO WITNESS ABUSED ANIMALS OR ASSIST IN THE------ EUTHANIZING OF UNWANTED, AGED, OR HOPELESSLY INJURED ANIMALS MAY EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL------ STRESS.--------------------- CARETAKERS MAY WORK OUTDOORS IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER. HOURS ARE IRREGULAR. ANIMALS HAVE TO------ BE FED EVERY DAY, SO CARETAKERS MUST WORK WEEKEND AND HOLIDAY SHIFTS. IN SOME ANIMAL------ HOSPITALS, RESEARCH FACILITIES, AND ANIMAL SHELTERS AN ATTENDANT IS ON DUTY 24 HOURS A------ DAY, WHICH MEANS NIGHT SHIFTS. MOST FULL-TIME CARETAKERS WORK ABOUT 40 HOURS A WEEK; SOME------ WORK 50 HOURS A WEEK OR MORE. CARETAKERS OF SHOW AND SPORTS ANIMALS TRAVEL TO------ COMPETITIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EMPLOYMENT----------------------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS HELD ABOUT 163,000 JOBS IN------ ABOUT 33,000 OF THE TOTAL WORKED AS------ VETERINARY ASSISTANTS IN VETERINARY SERVICES. THE REMAINDER WORKED PRIMARILY IN BOARDING------ KENNELS, BUT ALSO IN ANIMAL SHELTERS, STABLES, GROOMING SHOPS, ZOOS, AND LOCAL, STATE, AND------ FEDERAL AGENCIES. IN 1996, 2 OUT OF EVERY 10 CARETAKERS WAS SELF-EMPLOYED, AND 4 IN------ 10 WORKED PART TIME.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRAINING, OTHER QUALIFICATIONS, AND ADVANCEMENT----------------------------------- MOST ANIMAL CARETAKERS ARE TRAINED ON THE JOB. EMPLOYERS GENERALLY PREFER TO HIRE------ PEOPLE WITH SOME EXPERIENCE WITH ANIMALS. SOME TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR------ SPECIFIC TYPES OF ANIMAL CARETAKERS, BUT FORMAL TRAINING IS USUALLY NOT NECESSARY FOR------ ENTRY-LEVEL POSITIONS.---------------------- MOST PET GROOMERS LEARN THEIR TRADE BY COMPLETING AN INFORMAL APPRENTICESHIP, USUALLY------ LASTING 6 TO 10 WEEKS, UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN EXPERIENCED GROOME-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RS OFTEN CHOOSE TO OPEN THEIR OWN SHOPS.--------------------- BEGINNING ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN KENNELS LEARN ON THE JOB, AND USUALLY START BY CLEANING------ CAGES AND FEEDING AND WATERING ANIMALS. KENNEL CARETAKERS MAY BE PROMOTED TO KENNEL------ SUPERVISOR, ASSISTANT MANAGER, AND MANAGER, AND THOSE WITH ENOUGH CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE------ MAY OPEN UP THEIR OWN KENNELS. THE AMERICAN BOARDING KENNELS ASSOCIATION (ABKA) OFFERS A------ 3-STAGE, HOME-STUDY PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN PET CARE. THE FIRST TWO STUDY------ PROGRAMS ADDRESS BASIC AND ADVANCED PRINCIPLES OF ANIMAL CARE, WHILE THE THIRD PROGRAM------ FOCUSES ON IN-DEPTH ANIMAL CARE AND GOOD BUSINESS PROCEDURES. THOSE WHO COMPLETE THE THIRD------ PROGRAM AND PASS ORAL AND WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS ADMINISTERED BY THE ABKA BECOME CERTIFIED------ KENNEL OPERATORS (CKO).---------------------- THERE ARE NO FORMAL EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN VETERINARY------ FACILITIES.-THEY ARE TRAINED ON THE JOB, USUALLY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A VETERINARIAN OR------ VETERINARY TECHNICIAN. THEY START BY PERFORMING TASKS RELATED TO BASIC ANIMAL HEALTH CARE,------ SUCH AS KEEPING CAGES AND EXAMINATION AREAS SANITARY. THEY ALSO HELP VETERINARIANS PREPARE------ FOR SURGERY, STERILIZE SURGICAL EQUIPMENT, OBSERVE RECOVERING ANIMALS, AND GIVE------ MEDICATIONS AND BASIC MEDICAL TREATMENT UNDER THE DIRECTIONS OF A VETERINARIAN OR------ VETERINARY TECHNICIAN. HIGHLY MOTIVATED VETERINARY ASSISTANTS MAY BECOME VETERINARY------ TECHNICIANS, WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING FROM ONE OF APPROXIMATELY 65 ACCREDITED VETERINARY------ TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS.--------------------- EMPLOYERS OF ENTRY-LEVEL LABORATORY-ANIMAL CARETAKERS GENERALLY REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL------ DIPLOMA OR GENERAL EDUCATIONAL-DEVELOPMENT (GED) TEST. A FEW COLLEGES AND VOCATIONAL------ SCHOOLS OFFER PROGRAMS IN LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE WHICH PROVIDE TRAINING FOR TECHNICIAN------ POSITIONS, BUT SUCH TRAINING IS NOT STRICTLY NECESSARY. NEW ANIMAL CARETAKERS WORKING IN------ LABORATORIES BEGIN BY PROVIDING BASIC CARE TO LABORATORY ANIMALS.-WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING------ AND EXPERIENCE, THEY MAY ADVANCE TO MORE TECHNICAL POSITIONS IN LABORATORY ANIMAL CARE,------ SUCH AS RESEARCH ASSISTANT, MID-LEVEL TECHNICIAN, OR SENIOR-LEVEL TECHNOLOGIST. THE------ AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE (AALAS) OFFERS CERTIFICATION FOR THREE------ LEVELS OF TECHNICIAN COMPETENCE. THOSE WHO WISH TO BECOME CERTIFIED-AS ASSISTANT------ LABORATORY ANIMAL TECHNICIANS (ALAT) MUST SATISFY EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS------ BEFORE TAKING AN EXAMINATION ADMINISTERED BY AALAS.---------------------- SOME ZOOLOGICAL PARKS MAY REQUIRE THEIR CARETAKERS TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN BIOLOGY,------ ANIMAL SCIENCE, OR A RELATED FIELD. MOST REQUIRE EXPERIENCE WITH ANIMALS, PREFERABLY AS A------ VOLUNTEER OR PAID KEEPER IN A ZOO. ZOO KEEPERS MAY ADVANCE TO SENIOR KEEPER, ASSISTANT------ HEAD KEEPER, HEAD KEEPER, AND ASSISTANT CURATOR, BUT FEW OPENINGS OCCUR, ESPECIALLY FOR------ THE HIGHER-LEVEL POSITIONS.--------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN ANIMAL SHELTERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING,------ BUT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WORKSHOPS ARE INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE HUMANE SOCIETY------ OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE NATIONAL ANIMAL CONTROL ASSOCIATION. WORKSHOP TOPICS INCLUDE------ CRUELTY INVESTIGATIONS, APPROPRIATE METHODS OF EUTHANASIA FOR SHELTER ANIMALS, AND------ TECHNIQUES FOR-PREVENTING-PROBLEMS WITH WILDLIFE. WITH EXPERIENCE AND-ADDITIONAL-TRAINING,------ CARETAKERS IN ANIMAL SHELTERS MAY BECOME AN ADOPTION COORDINATOR, ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER,------ EMERGENCY RESCUE DRIVER, ASSISTANT SHELTER MANAGER, OR SHELTER DIRECTOR.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JOB OUTLOOK----------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANIMAL CARETAKERS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE GOOD. THE------ OUTLOOK FOR CARETAKERS IN ZOOS, HOWEVER, IS NOT FAVORABLE; JOBSEEKERS WILL FACE KEEN------ COMPETITION BECAUSE OF EXPECTED SLOW GROWTH IN ZOO CAPACITY, LOW TURNOVER, AND THE FACT------ THAT THE OCCUPATION ATTRACTS MANY CANDIDATES.--------------------- EMPLOYMENT IS EXPECTED TO GROW------------------ FASTER THAN THE AVERAGE---- FOR------ ALL OCCUPATIONS THROUGH THE YEAR------ THE GROWTH OF THE PET POPULATION, WHICH DRIVES------ EMPLOYMENT OF ANIMAL CARETAKERS IN KENNELS, GROOMING SHOPS, ANIMAL SHELTERS, AND------ VETERINARY CLINICS AND HOSPITALS, IS EXPECTED TO SLOW. NEVERTHELESS, PETS REMAIN POPULAR------ AND PET OWNERS------INCLUDING A LARGE NUMBER OF BABY BOOMERS WHOSE DISPOSABLE INCOME IS------ EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS THEY AGE------MAY INCREASINGLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GROOMING------ SERVICES, DAILY AND OVERNIGHT BOARDING SERVICES, AND VETERINARY SERVICES, SPURRING------ EMPLOYMENT GROWTH FOR ANIMAL CARETAKERS AND VETERINARY ASSISTANTS. DEMAND FOR ANIMAL------ CARETAKERS IN ANIMAL SHELTERS IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STEADY. COMMUNITIES ARE INCREASINGLY------ RECOGNIZING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ANIMAL ABUSE AND ABUSE TOWARD HUMANS, AND SHOULD------ CONTINUE TO COMMIT FUNDS TO ANIMAL SHELTERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE WORKING HAND-IN-HAND WITH------ SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TEAMS.---------------------- DESPITE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR ANIMAL CARETAKERS, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF JOBS WILL------ RESULT FROM THE NEED TO REPLACE WORKERS LEAVING THE FIELD. MANY ANIMAL-CARETAKER JOBS THAT------ REQUIRE LITTLE OR NO TRAINING HAVE WORK SCHEDULES WHICH TEND TO BE FLEXIBLE; THEREFORE, IT------ IS IDEAL FOR PEOPLE SEEKING THEIR FIRST JOB AND FOR STUDENTS AND OTHERS LOOKING FOR------ TEMPORARY OR PART-TIME WORK. BECAUSE TURNOVER IS QUITE HIGH, LARGELY DUE TO THE HARD-------PHYSICAL LABOR, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF JOBS SHOULD BE VERY GOOD. MUCH OF THE WORK OF------ ANIMAL CARETAKERS IS SEASONAL, PARTICULARLY DURING VACATION PERIODS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EARNINGS----------------------------------- ANIMAL CARETAKERS WHO WORKED FULL TIME EARNED A MEDIAN WEEKLY SALARY OF $290 IN------------ THE MIDDLE 50 PERCENT EARNED BETWEEN $220 AND----- $THE BOTTOM 10 PERCENT EARNED LESS THAN------ $170; THE TOP 10 PERCENT EARNED MORE THAN $500 A WEEK. ACCORDING TO A SALARY SURVEY BY THE------ NATIONAL ANIMAL CONTROL ASSOCIATION, NONSUPERVISORY ANIMAL CARETAKERS WORKING IN ANIMAL------ CARE AND CONTROL AGENCIES EARNED A YEARLY AVERAGE OF ABOUT $17,100 IN------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ RELATED OCCUPATIONS----------------------------------- OTHERS WHO WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH ANIMALS INCLUDE ANIMAL BREEDERS, ANIMAL-TRAINERS, ------LIVESTOCK FARM WORKERS, RANCHERS,------------------ VETERINARIANS----, VETERINARY------ TECHNICIANS AND TECHNOLOGISTS, AND-WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS AND ZOOLOGISTS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION----------------------------------- FOR MORE INFORMATION ON JOBS IN ANIMAL CARETAKING AND CONTROL, AND THE ANIMAL SHELTER------ AND CONTROL PERSONNEL TRAINING PROGRAM, WRITE TO:---------- THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES, 2100 L ST.
