---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT AT THE---- FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: IN A WORD-- CONTINUITY------------------------------------------------------------ PREPARED REMARKS OF--------------------------------------------------------------- TIMOTHY J. MURIS-------- CHAIRMAN-------- FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION-------------------------------------------------------------- BEFORE--------------------------------------------------------------- AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION-------- ANTITRUST SECTION ANNUAL MEETING---------------------------------------------------------- CHICAGO, ILLINOIS-------- AUGUST 7,----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2001  INTRODUCTION--------------------------------- GOOD AFTERNOON. I AM DELIGHTED TO-BE HERE, AND-I AM HONORED TO BE BACK AT---- THE FTC AS ITS CHAIRMAN.------------ AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW, THIS IS MY THIRD TOUR AT THE FTC. I FIRST SERVED AS ASSISTANT---- TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF POLICY PLANNING AND EVALUATION IN THE MID 1970S. I---- RETURNED IN-1981 TO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER PROTECTION, AND THEN-----BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION IN ------I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO THE---- INSTITUTION AND ITS MISSION OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS THROUGH ACTIVELY ENFORCING OUR---- ANTITRUST AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. I RETURN AS CHAIRMAN WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION OF---- THE CHALLENGES AND EXCITEMENT THAT LIE AHEAD.----------- THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION ABOUT POSSIBLE CHANGES AT THE COMMISSION. SOME---- PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL-CONTINUITY-FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION,---- WITH CHANGES MAINLY AT THE MARGINS. OTHERS AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE CONTINUITY BUT---- HEDGED THEIR BETS - THEY WERE UNCERTAIN HOW WIDE THE MARGINS MIGHT BE. OTHERS PREDICTED---- - PERHAPS WISHFULLY - THAT CHANGES WOULD BE MORE DRAMATIC. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ANTICIPATED---- SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED MERGER ENFORCEMENT. I EXPECT THE LAST GROUP WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. A---- VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IS NECESSARY TO FULFILL THE AGENCY'S MISSION TO PROTECT---- CONSUMERS. THE FIRST GROUP HAS IT RIGHT. CONTINUITY WILL BE-THE NORM, WITH CHANGES AT THE---- MARGINS.------------ WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A FIRST-RATE STAFF. IN THE OPERATING BUREAUS, WE HAVE: HOWARD BEALES,---- DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER PROTECTION; BILL KOVACIC, GENERAL COUNSEL; DAVID---- SCHEFFMAN, DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ECONOMICS; AND JOE SIMONS, DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF---- COMPETITION. ALL HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR FIELDS; EACH HAS SUBSTANTIAL PRIOR ----EXPERIENCE AT THE FTC; AND EACH HAS EXTENSIVE POST-FTC EXPERIENCE RELATED TO THE AGENCY'S---- MISSION. JOINING THIS GROUP ARE ANNA DAVIS, DIRECTOR OF CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS, WHO ALSO---- PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT THE FTC, ROSEMARIE STRAIGHT, WHO-REMAINS AS-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AND---- TWO NEWCOMERS: TED CRUZ, WHO IS OUR NEW DIRECTOR OF POLICY PLANNING,-AND CATHY MACFARLANE,---- WHO WILL HEAD OUR OFFICE OF-PUBLIC AFFAIRS. I APPOINTED THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR---- SUPERB QUALIFICATIONS AND, LIKE ME, THEY ARE COMMITTED TO THE FTC AND ITS MISSION.------------ TODAY, I WILL SKETCH A VISION OF THE LANDSCAPE AHEAD. ALONG THE WAY, I WILL RETRACE THE---- ORIGINS OF SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT I EXPECT TO FOLLOW. YOU WILL SEE THAT CONTINUITY---- SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE. THERE IS MUCH GROUND TO COVER, AND I WILL TOUCH ON EACH---- TOPIC ONLY BRIEFLY. YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS IN THE COMING MONTHS.------------ BEFORE CONTINUING, I SHOULD REPEAT THE STANDARD DISCLAIMER THAT MY REMARKS TODAY ARE MY---- OWN, AND NOT NECESSARILY THOSE OF THE COMMISSION OR-OF ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER.---------------------------------- I. WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT-CONTINUITY?--------------------- ANTITRUST HAS BECOME AN AREA OF BIPARTISAN COOPERATION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE---- DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT SPECIFIC CASES, THERE IS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT THAT-THE PURPOSE OF---- ANTITRUST IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS, THAT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS SHOULD GUIDE CASE SELECTION, AND---- THAT HORIZONTAL CASES, BOTH MERGERS AND AGREEMENTS AMONG COMPETITORS, ARE THE MAINSTAYS OF---- ANTITRUST. MOREOVER, TODAY THERE IS BIPARTISAN RECOGNITION THAT ANTITRUST LAW IS A WAY OF---- HELPING TO ORGANIZE OUR ECONOMY. A FREELY FUNCTIONING MARKET, SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF---- ANTITRUST, PROVIDES MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS.------------ BOB PITOFSKY'S TENURE AS-FTC CHAIRMAN WAS IN-THAT VEIN OF BIPARTISANSHIP. IN FACT, HE ----AND HIS APPOINTEES PRAISED THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PREDECESSOR, JANET STEIGER,-WHO WAS---- APPOINTED BY THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH. BOB WAS CLEARLY ONE OF THE-MOST EFFECTIVE CHAIRMEN---- IN-THE HISTORY OF THE COMMISSION.---------------------------------^ OF COURSE, BOB BROUGHT---- HIS INTELLECT, SCHOLARSHIP, AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS TO THE JOB. BUT A KEY REASON FOR BOB'S---- SUCCESS AS CHAIRMAN WAS THAT HIS-AGENDA AND-ENFORCEMENT POLICIES REFLECTED THE BIPARTISAN---- CONSENSUS. THOSE POLICIES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF HIS PREDECESSOR---- IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. THERE WERE CHANGES AT THE MARGINS, AND, AS WOULD ANY NEW---- CHAIRMAN, BOB FACED SOME NEW CHALLENGES. THAT IS MY MESSAGE TODAY - THERE WILL BE SOME---- CHANGES AT THE MARGINS, BUT MAINLY THERE WILL BE CONTINUITY. THERE WILL NOT BE A SEA---- CHANGE IN ENFORCEMENT.----------- BOB PITOFSKY SET A HIGH STANDARD, AND HE SHOULD BE-APPLAUDED FOR HIS EFFORTS ON BEHALF---- OF CONSUMERS. HE AND I MAY DIFFER ON CERTAIN POINTS, BUT I, TOO, INTEND TO CHARACTERIZE MY---- TENURE BY WHAT I DO, RATHER THAN WHAT I DO NOT DO. LET ME TURN TO SOME SPECIFIC AREAS OF---- ANTITRUST.----------------------------------  II. MERGER ENFORCEMENT-------------------- THIS YEAR IS THE---- 25^TH------ ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO---- ACT.---------------------------------------------- THE PASSAGE OF HSR AND THE RESULTING EVOLUTION OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT POLICY HAS---- UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT STATUTORY DEVELOPMENT IN ANTITRUST FOR SEVERAL---- DECADES. LIKE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT GENERALLY, MERGER ENFORCEMENT IS ABOUT PROTECTING---- CONSUMERS FROM UNWARRANTED EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER. AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FTC, I TAKE---- THAT MANDATE VERY SERIOUSLY. I DO NOT SEE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN-BASIC MERGER ENFORCEMENT-----FROM THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION. WE WILL APPLY THE-MERGER GUIDELINES---------------------------------------TO THE AVAILABLE FACTS, AS DID THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION.-PROBLEMATIC MERGERS WILL FACE THE---- SAME HURDLES THEY DID DURING THE 1990S.-------------------- A. EVOLUTION OF MERGER POLICY IN THE 1970S AND EARLY 1980S-------------------- LET ME ADD SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHY CONTINUITY IS APPROPRIATE. BY THE TIME OF---- THE---- GENERAL DYNAMICS----- DECISION IN 1974,---------------------------------- IT WAS---- CLEAR-THAT MERGER POLICY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE TO REFLECT NEW REALITIES. CASES LIKE---- VON'S--------- WERE RELICS OF THE PAST.---------------------------------- ECONOMIC RESEARCH DEBUNKED THE---- FEARS OF MARKET CONCENTRATION AT EVEN LOW LEVELS.---------------------------------- RIGID---- RELIANCE ON CONCENTRATION STATISTICS AND STRUCTURAL PRESUMPTIONS WOULD NO LONGER SUFFICE;---- WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS OF THE MARKET. THERE WAS GROWING---- AWARENESS THAT WE LIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY - MARKET BOUNDARIES DON'T NECESSARILY END AT---- THE U.S. BORDER. AND THERE WAS A GROWING REALIZATION THAT EFFICIENCIES ARE IMPORTANT.----------- THOSE CHANGES WERE REFLECTED IN 1982 MERGER GUIDELINES,-------------------------------------- PROMULGATED DURING BILL BAXTER'S REGIME AT THE ANTITRUST DIVISION. THE NEW GUIDELINES WERE---- A MILESTONE IN ANTITRUST. THEY INCORPORATED AN ECONOMICALLY SOUND ANALYTICAL STRUCTURE---- THAT WAS WORKABLE IN PRACTICE AND PROVIDED CLEAR GUIDEPOSTS FOR BUSINESSES AND ANTITRUST---- PRACTITIONERS.------------ THE 1982 GUIDELINES LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR TODAY'S MERGER ENFORCEMENT. ALTHOUGH---- IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS, THE CORE ANALYTICAL STRUCTURE REMAINS THE SAME. THE GUIDELINES---- HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE INFLUENTIAL. THE COURTS INCREASINGLY---- FOLLOW THEM, AND THEY HAVE GREATLY INFLUENCED MERGER ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE WORLD. BILL---- BAXTER IS, UNFORTUNATELY, NO LONGER WITH US, BUT HIS LEGACY LIVES ON. HIS GUIDELINES WERE---- APPLIED BY BOB PITOFSKY'S COMMISSION, AND I EXPECT TO DO THE SAME.----------- IN FACT, I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY IMPLEMENTERS OF THE 1982 GUIDELINES' ANALYTICAL---- STRUCTURE. WE WERE AN ACTIVE, EVEN PROACTIVE COMMISSION BACK THEN. I BECAME DIRECTOR OF---- THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION IN 1983, AND DURING MY 2X YEARS IN THAT POSITION, WE DEALT WITH---- MATTERS SUCH AS:------------------ TEXACO-GETTY--------------------------------------- AND---- SOCAL-GULF------------------------------------------------- TWO TRANSACTIONS THAT,---- AT THAT TIME-----, WERE-------- CONSIDERED LARGE OIL MERGERS;---------------- ONE OF THE FIRST CONSUMER BRANDED PRODUCTS MERGERS ANALYZED UNDER THE GUIDELINES;----------------------------------------------------------- ONE OF THE FIRST INSTANCES OF----- "COMPETING MERGERS-----" - TWO MERGERS IN THE------------ CARBON BLACK----- INDUSTRY;------------------------------------------------------- WARNER-POLYGRAM-----, A LARGE MERGER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY;---------------------------------------------------------- THE---- GM-TOYOTA----- JOINT VENTURE IN CALIFORNIA;-------------------------------------------------------- PILKINGTON BROTHERS,----- A FLAT GLASS MERGER THAT INVOLVED A NON-DOMESTIC COMPANY.--------------------------------------------------------------- ALLIED CORP.,----- A MERGER INVOLVING AVIONICS FOR GENERAL AVIATION AIRCRAFT.------------------------------------------------------------------ THESE WERE IMPORTANT CASES, AND THEIR INFLUENCE-IS PRESENT-TODAY. OUR ANALYSIS OF THE---- TEXACO/GETTY--------- AND---- SOCAL/GULF----- TRANSACTIONS, AND THE 1982 FTC OIL MERGER REPORT,---------------------------------------- LAID OUT MOST OF-THE BASICS OF-HOW THE FTC-HAS ANALYZED MUCH LARGER OIL MERGERS OVER THE---- PAST DECADE. THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS MERGER INVESTIGATION WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO USE---- STATISTICAL METHODOLOGIES TO ANALYZE SUBSTITUTABILITY OF BRANDED PRODUCTS. THAT ANALYSIS---- BY OUR BUREAU OF ECONOMICS STIMULATED FURTHER RESEARCH AND PAVED THE WAY FOR TODAY'S MAJOR---- COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF ECONOMISTS DOING ECONOMETRIC ANALYSES OF CONSUMER DEMAND FOR BRANDED---- PRODUCTS.---------------- WARNER-POLYGRAM----- PRESENTED VERY COMPLEX ISSUES IN ANALYZING COORDINATED---- INTERACTION IN A DYNAMIC INDUSTRY THAT THRIVES BY CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NEW,---- DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS. BOTH---- WARNER-POLYGRAM----- AND THE TWO---- CARBON BLACK--------- MERGERS WERE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED IN COURT. THE---- WARNER-POLYGRAM----- DECISION HAS---- BEEN VERY INFLUENTIAL IN THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS UNDER---- SECTION 13(B) OF THE FTC ACT.----------- FINALLY, THE-COMMISSION'S LENGTHY, VERY EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE GM-TOYOTA JOINT---- VENTURE WAS IMPORTANT, BOTH FOR THE U.S. AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND AMERICAN CONSUMERS, AND---- IN GUIDING LATER THINKING ABOUT JOINT VENTURES. OUR EXAMINATION OF THE POTENTIAL---- EFFICIENCIES OF THE JOINT VENTURE WAS CONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME. TODAY, HOWEVER, THERE ARE---- FEW WHO WOULD ARGUE WITH ALLOWING THE VENTURE TO PROCEED.-------------------- B. THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTS-------------------- THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE INVOLVED WITH MERGERS IN THOSE EARLY DAYS FOLLOWING THE---- 1982 GUIDELINES KNOW THAT WE ALL HAD A LOT TO LEARN. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THE---- GUIDELINES' NEW APPROACH TO MARKET DEFINITION. WE ALSO QUICKLY LEARNED THAT MERGER---- ANALYSIS UNDER THIS NEW REGIME WAS INCREDIBLY------------ FACT INTENSIVE--------------.------------ JOHN ADAMS, ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THIS COUNTRY, ONCE DISCUSSED FACTS IN A---- MANNER DIRECTLY RELEVANT FOR US TODAY. IN 1770, ADAMS DEFENDED THE BRITISH OFFICER AND---- SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF MURDER IN THE BOSTON MASSACRE. HE SAID:-------------------- FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS---------; AND WHATEVER MAY BE OUR WISHES, OUR---- INCLINATIONS, OR THE DICTATES OF OUR PASSIONS, THEY CANNOT ALTER THE STATE OF FACTS AND---- EVIDENCE.------------------------------------------------ STUBBORN FACTS ARE WHAT CHANGED ANTITRUST LAW AND ENFORCEMENT AFTER THE 1970S. FOR---- EXAMPLE, A 1983 WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL ON THE GM-TOYOTA JOINT VENTURE STATED:------------------------------- [T]HE RULES OF ANTITRUST LAW AS THEY HAD DEVELOPED [IN THE 1960S AND 1970S] WERE------ UNDERMINED BY OBSERVATION OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS.----------------------------------------------------------------- WE LEARNED LONG AGO THAT---- FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS----- IN MERGER ENFORCEMENT. NO---- ECONOMIC THEORY OR STORY-BASED ADVOCACY ABOUT A MERGER WILL GIVE YOU A RELIABLE ANSWER---- UNLESS THE FACTS FIRMLY SUPPORT IT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AS IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHY NO---- CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION OR CHANGE IN FACES IN THE AGENCIES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE---- MERGER ENFORCEMENT. JUST AS WE HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT A MERGER LIKELY WILL BE---- ANTICOMPETITIVE, YOU WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WITH SOUND, STUBBORN FACT-BASED ANALYSES THE---- CLAIMS THAT YOU MAKE.-------------------- C. MAINTAINING THE BASIC APPROACH-------------------- BY SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUITY, I DO NOT MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT I AGREED WITH---- EVERY SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT ACTION OF THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION; I DID NOT. OVERWHELMINGLY,---- HOWEVER, WHEN THE PARTIES PUSHED THE COMMISSION INTO COURT, THE COMMISSION WON. SO, HOW---- STUBBORN DO YOUR FACTS HAVE TO BE? I AGREE WITH THE APPROACH OF THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION.---- IF A MERGER APPEARS PROBLEMATIC, THE FACTS ON YOUR SIDE HAVE TO BE STUBBORN ENOUGH-TO-----CONVINCE A-FEDERAL JUDGE THAT WE CANNOT OBTAIN A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.------------ I KNOW THAT SOME IN THE PRESS AND THE-BAR THINK THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WILL RELAX---- ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT.-I URGE THEM, AND YOU, TO WATCH WHAT WE DO. I CAN TELL YOU---- UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT IF YOU COME IN WITH TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD NOT FLY IN THE PAST, YOU---- ARE LIKELY TO-------CRASH-----"UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPELLING, STUBBORN FACTS ON YOUR SIDE. TO---- SOME OF YOU, LET ME SAY IT MORE BLUNTLY. A FEW MEMBERS OF THE MERGER BAR HAVE BEEN TELLING---- THE PRESS THAT WE ARE GOING TO-HAVE MORE-RELAXED STANDARDS. THOSE FOLKS WILL BE DOING---- THEIR ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CLIENTS-A BIG DISSERVICE IF THOSE CLIENTS ACT ON THAT---- PRESUMPTION. IF YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED MERGER ATTORNEY, YOU KNOW A PROBLEMATIC MERGER WHEN---- YOU SEE IT.------------------- D. ATTENTION TO COMPETITIVE EFFECTS THEORIES-------------------- STAYING THE COURSE DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL STOP THINKING ABOUT THE THEORIES WE---- APPLY. THEORIES OF ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECTS HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME, AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO---- SO. FOR EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD WHAT COULD BE CALLED----- "UNILATERAL---- EFFECTS-----" THEORIES, THEY HAVE EVOLVED, AND THEY HAVE BEEN MORE WIDELY APPLIED SINCE---- THE 1992 REVISION OF THE GUIDELINES.-------------------------------------SOME QUESTION---- WHETHER THE AGENCY HAS GONE TOO FAR IN APPLYING UNILATERAL EFFECTS THEORIES. ONE ARGUMENT---- IS THAT WE MAY BE IN DANGER OF RETURNING TO ANTITRUST THAT FOCUSED ON THE ELIMINATION OF---- COMPETITION BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE MERGER, RATHER THAN COMPETITION AT THE MARKET---- LEVEL. I WOULD NOT GO THAT FAR. IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THEORY HAS OUTSTRIPPED---- REALITY. I DO AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FACTS TO APPLY A UNILATERAL---- EFFECTS THEORY.----------- THE ANALYSIS OF UNILATERAL EFFECTS OFTEN RELIES SUBSTANTIALLY ON ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS---- OF SCANNER DATA. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA.---- ALTHOUGH THE ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, THE THEORIES UNDERLYING MERGER SIMULATION MODELS---- ARE BASED ON SIMPLE AND RESTRICTIVE ASSUMPTIONS. THESE CAN BE USEFUL TOOLS, BUT WE ARE---- LOOKING AT THEM MORE CLOSELY TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THEIR STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS.------------ COORDINATED INTERACTION THEORIES HAVE ALSO EVOLVED. IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN MORE---- FOCUS ON THEORIES OF COORDINATED INTERACTION INVOLVING ALLEGED PRICE DISCRIMINATION. THIS---- IS AN AREA IN WHICH FACTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT PRICE---- DIFFERENCES-----,---- THEMSELVES, ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF PRICE DISCRIMINATION. PRICE DISCRIMINATION REQUIRES, AMONG---- OTHER THINGS,----- "SYSTEMATIC-----" PRICING POLICIES THAT RESULT IN EVIDENCE OF---- ACTUAL--------- TRANSACTION PRICES THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A THEORY OF PRICE DISCRIMINATION.-------------------- E. AREAS WHERE ENFORCEMENT POLICY IS STILL EVOLVING-------------------- ALTHOUGH THE BASICS OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT ARE FIRMLY IN PLACE, THERE ARE IMPORTANT---- SUBSTANTIVE AREAS THAT ARE STILL EVOLVING:----- "HIGH TECH-----"MERGERS INVOLVING---- SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION ISSUES; EFFICIENCIES; AND REMEDIES.--------------------------  HIGH TECH MERGERS------------------------------------ MERGER ANALYSIS IN----- "HIGH TECH-----" INDUSTRIES IS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN---- IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. THE BASIC GUIDELINES ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED. WE SHOULD PROCEED,---- HOWEVER, COGNIZANT OF OUR LESSER EXPERIENCE IN HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES. MOREOVER, THE HIGH---- TECH ARENA, BY ITS NATURE, IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. NEW HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES, OFTEN WITH---- NEW TECHNICAL ISSUES, CONTINUE TO BE BORN AND TO CHANGE.------------ ONE ASPECT OF HIGH TECH MAY WARRANT ESPECIALLY CLOSE SCRUTINY. THE FIERCE COMPETITION---- FOR SUCCESS IN THESE INDUSTRIES OFTEN RESULTS IN THE----- "WINNER-----" ENJOYING A---- (PERHAPS SHORT-LIVED) MONOPOLY. WE SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY RELUCTANT TO ALLOW THOSE FIRMS TO---- MERGE WITH ACTUAL (OR POTENTIAL) COMPETITORS. THIS WAS PART OF THE BASIS FOR MY CRITICISM---- OF THE CLINTON ANTITRUST DIVISION'S FAILURE TO CHALLENGE THE MICROSOFT-WEB TV MERGER.---------------------------------------------------- GIVEN THE RELATIVE NEWNESS OF APPLYING THE GUIDELINES TO HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES, WE---- SHOULD ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS MONITOR THE OUTCOMES WHEN---- WE DECIDE NOT TO INTERVENE. WE WILL LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE BUREAU OF ECONOMICS---- IN THESE RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINATIONS TO HELP INFORM FUTURE DECISIONS.--------------------------- EFFICIENCIES------------------------------------ THE AGENCIES HAVE COME FAR IN RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MERGER EFFICIENCIES. IN---- 1980, I WROTE AN ARTICLE ARGUING THAT THE AGENCIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE RELEVANCE OF---- MERGER EFFICIENCY CLAIMS.------------------------------------ TODAY, THERE IS NO QUESTION---- THAT THEY ARE RELEVANT, AS THE 1992 HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES REFLECTED. THE---- 1997 REVISION OF THE EFFICIENCIES SECTION OF THE GUIDELINES FURTHER IMPROVED THE ANALYTICAL---- TREATMENT OF EFFICIENCIES. AND A GROWING NUMBER OF COURTS NOW RECOGNIZE THE RELEVANCE OF---- EFFICIENCY CLAIMS.------------ DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, THE TREATMENT OF EFFICIENCIES IN MERGER ENFORCEMENT HAS ROOM FOR---- FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. I HAVE ARGUED THAT THE AGENCIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL CLASSES---- OF EFFICIENCIES, AND THAT THEIR ARGUMENT IN COURT IS STILL MUCH TOO HOSTILE.-----------------------------------------THE ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE BASED ON FACTS AND---- STUDY. THESE ARE CHANGES AT THE MARGIN, HOWEVER. FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE 1980S AND AS A---- CONSULTANT, FEW CASES WILL TURN SOLELY ON THE EFFICIENCY ISSUE. THE BEDROCK PRINCIPLE OF---- MERGER ENFORCEMENT REMAINS THE SAME - PROTECT CONSUMERS. IN EFFICIENCIES, AS IN ANY OTHER---- ANALYSIS, THE FACTS ARE CRUCIAL. EFFICIENCY CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT FIRMLY BASED IN STUBBORN---- FACTS WILL BE GIVEN NO WEIGHT.-------------------------- REMEDIES------------------------------------ THE COMMISSION'S RECENT POSTURE ON MERGER REMEDIES IS CONTROVERSIAL WITHIN THE BAR.---- MERGER REMEDIES, LIKE OTHER ASPECTS OF ANTITRUST, HAVE EVOLVED DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS.---- DURING MUCH OF THE----0S, THE AGENCY RESOLVED CASES RELATIVELY LESS FREQUENTLY WITH---- SETTLEMENTS. WHEN WE DID SETTLE, HOWEVER, WE INSISTED ON STRONG STRUCTURAL RELIEF. OUR---- LENGTHY REVIEW AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR REMEDIES IN THE TEXACO-GETTY MATTER IN-1984 LED SOME---- LAWYERS FOR TEXACO TO SUGGEST THAT WE-WERE A DISTRACTION FROM THEIR GOALS. THAT VIEW OF---- OUR ROLE IS MISINFORMED. AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT.---- NOW, AS THEN, WE MUST PROTECT CONSUMERS, NOT HELP YOU GET YOUR DEAL THROUGH AT CONSUMERS'---- EXPENSE.----------- ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES THE COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY USED-IS AN UP-FRONT-BUYER OF DIVESTED---- ASSETS. MUCH OF THE CRITICISM IN THE BAR HAS BEEN THAT-THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND---- VETTING AN UP-FRONT BUYER SLOWS DOWN THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS. A COUNTERVAILING---- CONSIDERATION IS THAT AN UP-FRONT BUYER CAN PROVIDE ADDED ASSURANCE THAT A SETTLEMENT WILL---- WORK AS PLANNED. IT MAY BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN PROPOSED DIVESTITURE INVOLVES AN ASSET---- PACKAGE THAT CONSTITUTES LESS THAN AN ONGOING BUSINESS, WHOSE VIABILITY IS SOMEWHAT---- UNCERTAIN, OR ASSETS THAT MAY DETERIORATE OVER TIME. THERE IS THUS AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR---- UP-FRONT BUYERS ON OCCASION.------------ AN UP-FRONT BUYER IS NOT AN END IN ITSELF, OF COURSE. OUR PRINCIPAL GOAL IS TO PROTECT---- CONSUMERS. WE WILL REQUIRE A DIVESTITURE THAT WILL LIKELY CREATE A VIABLE------------ BUSINESS---- ENTITY-------------- (RATHER THAN A CREATION OF LAWYERS) TO RESOLVE THE COMPETITIVE---- PROBLEMS POSED BY THE MERGER. WE MAY BE CONFIDENT BEFORE IDENTIFYING ONE SPECIFIC BUYER---- THAT ACCEPTABLE CANDIDATES EXIST. AS WITH SO MUCH ELSE OF MODERN MERGER ANALYSIS, THE---- ISSUE IS HIGHLY FACT SPECIFIC.------------------- F. THE MERGER REVIEW PROCESS-------------------- AS I NOTED EARLIER, THIS YEAR MARKS THE---- 25^TH------ ANNIVERSARY OF THE---- HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT. A LOT HAS CHANGED. WHEN I BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF---- COMPETITION IN 1983, THE MERGER REVIEW PROCESS UNDER HSR WAS STILL EVOLVING; WE WERE STILL---- ON THE LEARNING CURVE. TODAY, WE HAVE A WELL-FUNCTIONING PROGRAM IN PLACE - NOT PERFECT,---- AS ALL OF YOU WILL AGREE, BUT IT DOES A REMARKABLE JOB. WE HAVE A SMALLER PROFESSIONAL---- STAFF THAN WE DID IN THE EARLY 1980S, AS WELL AS FEWER SUPPORT STAFF, BUT WE REVIEW MANY---- TIMES MORE MERGER FILINGS. WE HAVE HIGHLY SKILLED AND DEDICATED LAWYERS AND ECONOMISTS,---- AND AN EXCELLENT SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM. THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION AND BUREAU OF ECONOMICS---- WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER. MERGER REVIEW IS FIRMLY GROUNDED IN FACTS AND SOUND ECONOMIC---- ANALYSIS.------------ BUT AS I SAID, NOT ALL IS PERFECT. THOUSANDS OF MERGERS ARE FILED EACH YEAR, AND SOME---- QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTIONS MAY SLIP THROUGH THE SCREENING PROCESS. THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO---- THE HSR ACT, WHICH INCREASED THE FILING THRESHOLD, MAY HAVE MADE IT MORE LIKELY THAT WE---- WILL MISS-A FEW PROBLEMATIC TRANSACTIONS. I HAVE DIRECTED BC DIRECTOR JOE SIMONS TO---- INCREASE OUR EFFORTS IN REVIEWING THE BUSINESS-PRESS AND OTHER SOURCES TO IDENTIFY-----POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC MERGERS. IF YOU HAVE CLIENTS THAT ARE CONCERNED WITH A---- TRANSACTION, LET US KNOW---- - WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN CONSUMMATED-----.-WE ARE QUITE---- PREPARED TO GO AFTER-CONSUMMATED MERGERS-OR MERGERS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO REQUIRE AN HSR---- FILING. IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE-PARTIES WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH-----THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE HSR REGULATIONS, OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST---- ANTICOMPETITIVE MERGERS. SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT, DURING MY TENURE AS BUREAU DIRECTOR,---- WE BROUGHT THE FIRST 7(A) CASE.----------------------------------------------- LET ME TURN NOW TO---- 2^ND------ REQUESTS. THE BURDENS OF THE---- 2^ND------ REQUEST---- PROCESS CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN. ALTHOUGH THE AGENCIES HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS TO---- REDUCE THE BURDEN, THERE IS ROOM FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. THE NUMBER OF BOXES OF DOCUMENTS---- SUBMITTED FOR A TYPICAL---- 2^ND------ REQUEST HAS SKY-ROCKETED. WHERE ONCE WE HAD---- HUNDREDS OF BOXES, IN SOME MATTERS WE NOW HAVE---- THOUSANDS----- OF BOXES. OF COURSE,---- SOME MERGERS ARE VERY COMPLEX AND TEND TO INVOLVE VOLUMES OF DOCUMENTS. MOREOVER, I HAVE---- WORKED ON ENOUGH MERGERS TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE THE AGENCY'S JOB---- EASY. IN ANY EVENT, GIVEN THE-BURDENS INVOLVED FOR BOTH THE MERGING PARTIES AND AGENCY---- STAFF, WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO DO OUR JOBS MORE EFFICIENTLY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHAT---- YOU SUBMIT IS AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE TO OUR DOING OUR JOB OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. WE WILL---- HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS IN THE COMING MONTHS.------------ WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE MERGER INVESTIGATIONS MORE EFFICIENT IN OTHER WAYS. AS WE---- ALL KNOW, THE STATUTORY DEADLINES ARE ALMOST NEVER BINDING FOR A PROBLEMATIC MERGER.---- BECAUSE THE DEADLINES ARE TOO SHORT TO ANALYZE A COMPLEX MERGER FULLY, WE USUALLY ARRANGE---- AN ACCOMMODATION FOR MORE TIME. NONETHELESS, MERGER INVESTIGATIONS, ON AVERAGE, PROBABLY---- TAKE LONGER THAN NECESSARY. WE WILL TRY TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS FURTHER.------------ IMPROVED COMMUNICATION IS PART OF THE ANSWER. BOTH SIDES HAVE TO JOIN ISSUE ON THE---- CRITICAL ASPECTS OF A MERGER. IF A MERGER APPEARS-PROBLEMATIC, THE BURDEN IS ON THE---- PARTIES TO CONVINCE US THAT THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS OR THAT ANY PROBLEMS CAN BE FULLY---- REMEDIED WITH A SUITABLE DIVESTITURE. WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING OUR POSITION IN POTENTIAL---- LITIGATION, WE CAN PROBABLY COMMUNICATE MORE CLEARLY TO THE PARTIES THE BASES OF OUR---- CONCERNS. JOE-SIMONS AND-I ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO IMPROVE THE---- MERGER REVIEW PROCESS WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE ABILITY TO DO OUR JOB.------------ IN THAT VEIN, WE WILL BE CONDUCTING----- "BEST PRACTICES-----" SESSIONS WITH THE---- ANTITRUST DIVISION, BEGINNING WITH 2D-REQUEST AND REMEDIES ISSUES, TO STRENGTHEN BOTH OF---- OUR AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION IS-PLANNING A SERIES OF----- "BROWN---- BAG-----" LUNCHES IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND SOME OF OUR REGIONAL OFFICES TO DISCUSS YOUR-----CONCERNS ABOUT REMEDIES. WE HOPE THAT THESE STEPS WILL OFFER ADDITIONAL BASES FOR---- IMPROVING THE MERGER REVIEW PROCESS.----------------------------------  III. INTERNATIONAL ANTITRUST--------------------- LET ME TURN TO A NEW TOPIC: COMPETITION POLICY IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY. INCREASINGLY, U.S.---- COMPANIES AND THE U.S. ANTITRUST AGENCIES INTERACT WITH OUR COMPETITION LAW COUNTERPARTS.---- THESE INTERACTIONS RAISE A MULTITUDE OF PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES. THE FTC IS---- CERTAIN TO GIVE INCREASING ATTENTION TO THESE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. AMONG OTHER MATTERS,---- WE WILL:-------------- CONTINUE INFORMATION EXCHANGES WITH FOREIGN ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO PROMOTE-------- THE EFFECTIVE HANDLING OF PARTICULAR MATTERS INVOLVING MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS;--------------- DEVOTE GREATER EFFORTS TO BI-LATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS TO-------- ESTABLISH A CONSENSUS ABOUT----- "BEST PRACTICES-----" IN PROCESS AND SUBSTANTIVE-------- ANALYSIS;--------------- CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN MULTINATIONAL INITIATIVES (OECD, WTO, GLOBAL COMPETITION-------- INITIATIVE, AND OTHERS) TO HELP STREAMLINE ANTITRUST PROCEDURES AND ENCOURAGING ACCEPTANCE-------- OF THE BEST ANALYTICAL METHODS; AND--------------- CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO ASSIST TRANSITION ECONOMIES TO BUILD SENSIBLE COMPETITION POLICY-------- AND CONSUMER PROTECTION SYSTEMS.---------------------  OUR GENERAL COUNSEL, BILL KOVACIC, HAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN HIS OFFICE AN INTERNATIONAL---- COORDINATION FUNCTION FOCUSING ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TRANSITION ECONOMIES. TO MANAGE---- THIS FUNCTION, I HAVE APPOINTED MY LONG-TIME FRIEND JIM HAMILL TO BE SENIOR COUNSEL FOR---- INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IN THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION'S---- INTERNATIONAL DIVISION, HEADED BY RANDY TRITELL, WILL CONTINUE TO HANDLE LIAISON WITH---- FOREIGN ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES AND MULTINATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.---------------------------------- IV. NON-MERGER ENFORCEMENT--------------------- LET ME MOVE TO A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF NON-MERGER ENFORCEMENT. THERE ARE SEVERAL---- IMPORTANT ISSUES HERE, SUCH AS COMPETITION IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY---- ISSUES. AS IN THE CASE OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT, FACTS ARE CRITICAL. OUR CASES WILL BE---- EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED. SOUND THEORY IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT MUST FIT THE FACTS OF THE CASE.----------------------------------------------------- MY INTEREST IN NON-MERGER ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISING. THE COMMISSION WAS VERY---- ACTIVE IN PURSUING NON-MERGER MATTERS WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION---- IN THE EARLY1980S. DURING MY TENURE, WE PUT 17 NON-MERGER CASES IN----- "PART III---------" ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION. IMPORTANT CASES SUCH AS---- TICOR-----,-------------------------------------------- SUPERIOR COURT TRIAL LAWYERS ASS'N,--------------------------------------------- MASS---- BOARD-----,-----------------------------------------DETROIT AUTO DEALERS,------------------------------------------------- TAXICABS-----,-----------------------------------------AND---- U-HAUL------------------------------------------WERE AMONG THAT GROUP. EACH CASE---- THAT WE LITIGATED WAS DECIDED AGAINST THE RESPONDENTS, INCLUDING THREE THAT WENT TO THE---- SUPREME COURT.----------------------------------------------- MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG NON-MERGER AGENDA. WE USED---- TO BELIEVE THAT ANTITRUST COUNSELING, AT LEAST FOR MAJOR COMPANIES, WOULD GENERALLY DETER---- ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCT. WE HAVE LEARNED, HOWEVER, FROM---- ADM-----,---------------------------------------- THE VITAMINS CASE,------------------------------------ NUMEROUS OTHER PRICE-FIXING CASES,---- AND FROM---- MICROSOFT-----,------------------------------------ THAT THE ANTITRUST---- AGENCIES MUST AGGRESSIVELY POLICE COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. IN A RECENT MATTER THE COMMISSION---- ISSUED COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THERE WAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT COMPETITORS ENGAGED IN---- PER---- SE----- VIOLATIONS.------------ LET ME NOW EXPLORE A FEW AREAS OF CURRENT INTEREST.------------------- A. HATCH-WAXMAN ISSUES-------------------- THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION WAS VERY ACTIVE IN LOOKING AT POTENTIAL ABUSES OF THE---- HATCH-WAXMAN ACT, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO PROMOTE GENERIC COMPETITION IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL---- INDUSTRY. WE ARE CONTINUING THOSE-EFFORTS. THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL---- INDUSTRY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO-AMERICAN CONSUMERS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACTIVE, ONGOING---- INVESTIGATIONS, AND WE ARE ALSO CONDUCTING A STUDY OF HATCH-WAXMAN RELATED ISSUES. AS YOU---- PROBABLY KNOW, A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MODIFY HATCH-WAXMAN TO---- CURB THE ALLEGED ABUSES. OUR STUDY AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN INVESTIGATING THESE ISSUES MAY---- PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE FOR POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF THE ACT.------------------- B. HORIZONTAL EMPHASIS-------------------- IT IS UNCONTROVERSIAL THAT HORIZONTAL ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF NON-MERGER---- ENFORCEMENT. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVE IN FINDING,---- INVESTIGATING, AND BRINGING ACTIONS AGAINST ANTICOMPETITIVE HORIZONTAL ACTIVITIES. WE---- ALREADY HAVE A NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES UNDER WAY. THE PROFESSIONS AND HEALTH CARE ARE---- AREAS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST.------------ ONE OF THE ISSUES WE WILL BE DEALING WITH IS THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR JUDGING SOME OF---- THESE HORIZONTAL AGREEMENTS. WHEN I WAS AT THE BUREAU OF COMPETITION IN THE 1980S, WE---- DEVELOPED A TRUNCATED RULE OF REASON ANALYSIS THAT THE COMMISSION ADOPTED IN---- MASSACHUSETTS---- BD. OF REGISTRATION OF OPTOMETRY.--------------------------------------------- MASS BOARD--------- APPLIED A STRUCTURED ANALYSIS THAT AVOIDED A RIGID---- PER SE-----/RULE OF REASON---- CATEGORIZATION. IT PROVIDED AN INTERMEDIATE FORM OF ANALYSIS FOR INHERENTLY SUSPECT---- RESTRAINTS THAT APPEAR LIKELY, ABSENT AN EFFICIENCY JUSTIFICATION, TO RESTRICT COMPETITION---- AND REDUCE OUTPUT. THE COMMISSION DECIDED NOT TO APPLY THE---- MASS BOARD----- METHODOLOGY---- IN THE---- CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION----- CASE, OPTING INSTEAD TO USE THE TRADITIONAL---- PER---- SE-----/RULE OF REASON CATEGORIZATION. IT HELD THE ADVERTISING RESTRAINTS IN THAT CASE TO---- BE UNLAWFUL UNDER BOTH THE---- PER SE----- STANDARD AND AN ABBREVIATED RULE OF REASON---- ANALYSIS. THE-NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED UNDER THE ABBREVIATED RULE OF REASON THEORY, BUT THE---- SUPREME COURT REVERSED,-HOLDING THE COMMISSION'S ANALYSIS TO BE TOO ABBREVIATED. WHAT IS---- REQUIRED, SAID THE COURT, IS----- "AN ENQUIRY MEET-FOR THE CASE, LOOKING TO THE---- CIRCUMSTANCES, DETAILS, AND LOGIC OF A RESTRAINT.---------------------------------------------" IT THEREFORE TEACHES THAT FACTS, NOT RIGID CATEGORIES, SHOULD GUIDE THE ANALYSIS.----------- IN LIGHT OF---- CDA-----, WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO DEVELOP A WORKABLE APPROACH THAT---- IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. I BELIEVE THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE PREVAILED IN THAT CASE HAD---- IT BEEN TRIED UNDER THE---- MASS BOARD----- STANDARD, WITH RECORD EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN WHY---- THE ADVERTISING RESTRAINTS SHOULD BE ANALYZED UNDER A TRUNCATED APPROACH. THAT EVIDENCE---- WAS AVAILABLE. THERE IS PLENTIFUL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS---- ON PRICE AND QUALITY FLOWING FROM RESTRICTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISING, BUT THE RECORD---- CONTAINED PRECIOUS LITTLE OF THAT EVIDENCE. REGARDLESS OF THE PRECISE FORM OF TRUNCATED---- ANALYSIS ONE CHOOSES TO USE, THE KEY TO PROSECUTING SUCH A CASE SUCCESSFULLY IS TO BUILD A---- RECORD THAT CONTAINS SUPPORT FOR CLAIMS OF PROBABLE ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECT.--------------------------------------------------- TWO OTHER ISSUES WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ARE THE---- NOERR-PENNINGTON----- AND STATE---- ACTION EXEMPTIONS. YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE BROUGHT CASES INVOLVING THESE AREAS DURING MY---- STINT AS COMPETITION BUREAU DIRECTOR IN THE 1980S---- - TICOR----- AND---- U-HAUL-----.---- THE TRANSITION REPORT PREPARED BY THE ABA ANTITRUST SECTION STATED THAT THE STATE ACTION---- EXEMPTION STILL PRESENTS CONCERNS FROM A COMPETITION POLICY STANDPOINT.-----------------------------------------THE REPORT RECOMMENDED A REEXAMINATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION. WE ARE DOING THAT.-------------------- C. MONOPOLIZATION-------------------- SOME OF-YOU MAY BE-WONDERING WHAT MY POSITION WILL BE ON MONOPOLIZATION CASES. AGAIN,---- IT IS THE STUBBORN FACTS THAT COUNT MOST. WHERE WE CAN SHOW THAT EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT---- REASONABLY APPEARS CAPABLE OF MAKING A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO CREATING OR MAINTAINING---- MONOPOLY POWER, WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO ACT.----------------------------------------------- THE STRONG APPELLATE DECISION IN---- MICROSOFT----- RE-CONFIRMS THAT IMPROPER CONDUCT---- BY FIRMS-WITH MONOPOLY POWER CAN GIVE RISE TO SUBSTANTIAL ANTITRUST ISSUES. THE COMMISSION-----WILL NOT BACK AWAY FROM-THESE TYPES OF CASES, BUT THEY-MUST BE ECONOMICALLY AND FACTUALLY---- SOUND. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE---- U-HAUL----- CASE THAT WE BROUGHT IN 1985, THE COMPLAINT---- ALLEGED THAT U-HAUL AND ITS PARENT AMERCO ATTEMPTED TO MONOPOLIZE THE MARKET FOR RENTAL---- MOVING EQUIPMENT BY ENGAGING IN A SERIES OF ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTS AGAINST A COMPETITOR IN A---- CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION PROCEEDING,-JARTRAN, AND THAT THE RESPONDENTS--------- "IN FACT--------- INJURED COMPETITION BY JEOPARDIZING AND SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYING JARTRAN'S EMERGENCE AS A---- REORGANIZED COMPANY, CAPABLE OF RESUMING ITS ROLE AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPETITOR.-----------------------------------------------------------------" D. PROCESS ISSUES-------------------- WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM AT THE FTC WITH THE SPEED AND EFFICIENCY OF NON-HSR---- INVESTIGATIONS. UNLIKE HSR, WE DO NOT HAVE A STATUTORY CLOCK THAT PUSHES SUCH CASES. I---- HAVE DIRECTED JOE SIMONS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT NEW PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. WE WANT OUR---- NON-MERGER ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE----- "TIMELY, LIKELY AND EFFICIENT.----------------------------------------" V. NON-ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES--------------------- ONE OF THE BEST INNOVATIONS OF THE PITOFSKY COMMISSION WAS TO BE ACTIVE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. IN A RELATED VEIN, WE WILL LOOK FOR SUITABLE-OPPORTUNITIES TO BE A COMPETITION---- POLICY ADVOCATE AS-AN---- AMICUS CURIAE----- IN PRIVATE LITIGATION. THOSE CASES WILL BE---- LIMITED TO SITUATIONS WHERE WE CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION ON IMPORTANT LEGAL ISSUES.----------------------------------  CONCLUSION--------------------- PROTECTING CONSUMERS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS AND THE MISSION OF THE---- FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. I FULLY SUPPORT OUR MISSION AND A VIGOROUS PRO-CONSUMER---- ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT AGENDA. THE----- "STUBBORN FACTS-----" OF OUR ACTIONS WILL NOT---- SUPPORT THE PRECONCEPTIONS OF SOME THAT WE ARE HERE TO PUT THE BRAKES ON ANTITRUST. I LOOK---- FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ABA TO ENSURE THAT OUR ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT IS THE BEST IT---- CAN BE TO PROTECT AMERICAN CONSUMERS.-------------------------- ENDNOTES:--------------------------------------------------------- TIMOTHY J.
