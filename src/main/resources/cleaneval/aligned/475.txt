ORIGINALLY FROM--------------- SUNDAY, MAY 23,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY I FIRST CONGRATULATE ALL-THE 1141 DEGREE RECIPIENTS OF------ I'M NOT SO OLD-THAT I DON'T VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE PRECEDING--------------- PANIC, THE RELIEF AND THE QUIET SATISFACTION THAT-CAME WITH GETTING A BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE THAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WAS--------------- A RARE THING IN MY IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILY. IT WASN'T SO EASY FOR ME THEN; I KNOW IT WASN'T SO EASY FOR MANY-OF YOU-------AND--------------- FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS: FINANCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL. SO PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAVOR YOUR ACHIEVEMENT;-IN FACT, WHY--------------- DON'T YOU GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.---------------------------------------------------------- BUT NOW WHAT DO YOU DO? I DON'T MEAN WHAT DO YOU DO-FOR WORK OR CAREER; I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO ADVISE-YOU, ESPECIALLY IN THIS ---------------JOB MARKET.-----------------------------------------------------------NO, WHEN I POSE-THE-QUESTION, -------WHAT-DO YOU DO?-------, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR INTERIOR LIFE, YOUR INTELLECTUAL AND ETHICAL LIFE;--------------- THE LIFE THAT WILL INFORM-THE WHOLE RANGE OF DECISIONS AND ACTIONS THAT YOU WILL BE CALLED-UPON TO MAKE WHEN YOU BECOME A--------------- POST-GRADUATE WORKER-------ESPECIALLY WHERE-THOSE ETHICAL CHOICES EFFECT YOUR FUTURE; YOUR-ACTUAL EARNING CAPACITY; YOUR JOB; YOUR--------------- FAMILY.---------------------------------------------------------- AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT STEERING YOUR INTERIOR LIFE, I WANT TO TELL A STORY ABOUT SOMEONE WHO--------------- WAS CALLED UPON TO MAKE A DIFFICULT INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL CHOICE, AT A LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER THAT NONE OF US ARE EVER--------------- LIKELY TO POSSESS.---------------------------------------------------------- LET ME SET THE SCENE FOR YOU: IT'S WASHINGTON D.C.,-------DESPITE THE SOVIET-AMERICAN COLD WAR, DESPITE THE CONSTRUCTION OF--------------- THE BERLIN WALL, DESPITE THE BAY OF PIGS DEBACLE IN CUBA, DESPITE THE SUBSEQUENT CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, DESPITE THE ASSASSINATION--------------- OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY; DESPITE THE MODEST COMMITMENT OF U.S. MILITARY ADVISORS TO A FORMER FRENCH COLONY CALLED VIETNAM, THE--------------- UNITED STATES IS MORE OR LESS AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD. A SKEPTIC MIGHT SAY THAT WHAT EXISTED IN 1964 WAS MERELY THE TEMPORARY--------------- ABSENCE OF WAR, BUT NINETEEN YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II-AND JUST ELEVEN AFTER THE KOREAN WAR, THE ABSENCE OF WAR ISN'T SUCH--------------- A BAD STATE OF AFFAIRS.---------------------------------------------------------- INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON, HOWEVER, A FEROCIOUS BUT AS YET HIDDEN ARGUMENT IS TAKING PLACE THAT--------------- HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER AMERICA WILL REMAIN, MORE OR LESS, AT PEACE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ARGUMENT IS VERY ONE-SIDED.--------------- INDEED, THERE ARE DOZENS OF PEOPLE ON ONE SIDE AND ESSENTIALLY JUST ONE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE DOZENS OF LIKEMINDED--------------- PEOPLE FAVOR A GREATER COMMITMENT OF U.S. TROOPS TO SOUTH-VIETNAM BECAUSE THEY'VE-GOTTEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT VIETNAM--------------- IS THE PLACE TO-DRAW THE LINE AGAINST COMMUNISM. THIS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ESPOUSES SOMETHING CALLED THE DOMINO THEORY, WHICH--------------- POSITS THAT IF SOUTH VIETNAM FALLS-TO COMMUNIST REBELS-------THOSE WHO WOULD UNITE THE COUNTRY WITH COMMUNIST NORTH VIETNAM-------THEN--------------- ALL THE NON-COMMUNIST NATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA WILL FALL TO MARXIST IDEOLOGY-------LIKE DOMINOS ON END, LINED UP ON A TABLE, WHEN--------------- ONE TIPS OVER.---------------------------------------------------------- THE MINORITY OF ONE,-AN UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE NAMED GEORGE W. BALL, DOES NOT AGREE. HE'S NEVER BEEN TO VIETNAM, BUT HE'S--------------- DONE A LOT OF READING AND-THINKING ON THE SUBJECT. HE'S LOOKED AT THE DISASTROUS FRENCH EXPERIENCE AND HE'S DRAWN SOME CONCLUSIONS--------------- THAT DON'T FOLLOW THE PARTY LINE OF THE COLD WARRIORS SERVING UNDER PRESIDENT JOHNSON.---------------------------------------------------------- BALL ALREADY HAS A REPUTATION FOR INDEPENDENT THINKING. A MIDWESTERNER, BORN IN MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA AND RAISED THERE AND IN--------------- EVANSTON, ILLINOIS, HE IS A DISCIPLE OF BERNARD DEVOTO, THE INDEPENDENT ESSAYIST AND NON-ACADEMIC HISTORIAN PAR EXCELLENCE.--------------- TO HIS STUDENTS AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AND TO THE READERS OF HIS EASY CHAIR COLUMN IN HARPER'S MAGAZINE, DEVOTO PREACHED--------------- A SERIOUS AMATEUR'S APPROACH TO BOOK-LEARNING-------AN UNSPECIALIZED COURSE OF READING MEANT TO TRAIN PROPER CITIZENS-------CITIZENS WHO--------------- WOULD RESIST ORTHODOXY AND CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, CITIZENS UNAFRAID OF-POLITICALLY POWERFUL BULLIES.---------------------------------------------------------- BALL TOOK DEVOTO'S INSTRUCTION TO HEART. FOR THE-REST OF HIS LIFE HIS INTELLECTUAL SELF-CONFIDENCE MADE HIM A TRUE DEMOCRAT--------------- WITH A SMALL D-------THAT IS, A TRUE AMERICAN WHO FELT HIMSELF THE EQUAL OF ANY OTHER AMERICAN, WHATEVER THEIR TITLE AND BACKGROUND-------WHATEVER--------------- THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE OR WEALTH. GEORGE BALL FELT IT WAS HIS RIGHT TO ARGUE WITH ANYONE ON-ANY SUBJECT, SO LONG AS HE'D--------------- STUDIED IT.---------------------------------------------------------- IT-WAS BALL'S-NON-DEFERENTIAL NATURE THAT LED HIM, FROM MAY 1964 TO MAY 1966, TO CHALLENGE THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION'S VIETNAM--------------- POLICY WITH A-REMARKABLE SERIES OF PAPERS-------TWENTY IN ALL-------THAT STRUCK HARD AT THE THEORIES OF THE ORTHODOX MAJORITY. STARTING--------------- ON MAY 31 OF '64, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE INFAMOUS GULF OF TONKIN INCIDENT, BALL FOUGHT A PRIVATE WAR-------AN INSIDER'S WAR-------TO HALT--------------- THE GROWING FOLLY OF VIETNAM. A CAMPAIGN THAT BEGAN AS A SIMPLE WARNING QUICKLY ESCALATED, PARALLEL WITH THE WAR ITSELF, INTO--------------- A FULL-SCALE ASSAULT ON THE ARROGANT ASSUMPTIONS OF LBJ'S CLOSEST ADVISORS-------HIS YES MEN-------DEAN RUSK, MCGEORGE BUNDY, WALT ROSTOW--------------- AND ROBERT MCNAMARA. WHILE TROOPS NUMBERING IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SHIPPED OUT FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHILE BOMB TONNAGE--------------- NUMBERING IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS RAINED DOWN ON RICE PADDIES AND CITIES,-BALL FIRED-AWAY WITH THE ONLY AMMUNITION AT ---------------HIS DISPOSAL-------ARTICULATE LANGUAGE, THOUGHTFUL CRITICISM AND PERSONAL CHARM.---------------------------------------------------------- HIS BIOGRAPHER JAMES BILL SUMMARIZES:------ "BALL ARGUED THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD SHORTSIGHTEDLY STUMBLED INTO-A QUAGMIRE IN VIETNAM.--------------- HE QUESTIONED EACH OF THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE MOUNTING AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT:--) VIETNAM WAS A COUNTRY--------------- ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO U.S. INTERESTS; 2) IF THE-SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT WERE TO COME UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE VIETCONG,--------------- THE REST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA WOULD FALL INEXORABLY TO THE COMMUNISTS; 3) THE-SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT COULD RALLY ITS POPULATION,--------------- AND WITH ENOUGH U.S. ASSISTANCE, IT WOULD PREVAIL IN THE STRUGGLE; AND 4) EVEN IF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE COULD NOT OVERCOME--------------- THE VIETCONG, THE UNITED STATES COULD DEFEAT THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNIST MOVEMENT THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF SUPERIOR MILITARY--------------- FORCE.-----------------------------------------------------------------" ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS WERE WRONG AND-GEORGE BALL SAID SO TO PRESIDENT-JOHNSON WHEN THERE WAS STILL TIME TO AVERT DISASTER.--------------- HIS OWN LANGUAGE IS WORTH QUOTING: OCTOBER 5, 1964:------ "OUR SITUATION WOULD IN THE WORLD'S EYES APPROACH THAT OF FRANCE IN THE--------------- 1950S. WE WOULD INCUR THE OPPOSITION OF ELEMENTS IN VIET-NAM OTHERWISE FRIENDLY TO US. FINALLY,-WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES IN------------------ LA GUERRE---- SALE WITH CONSEQUENT HEAVY LOSS OF AMERICAN LIVES IN THE RICE PADDIES AND JUNGLES.------" JUNE 18, 1965: BALL OPENS WITH A QUOTE--------------- FROM EMERSON:------ "THINGS ARE IN THE SADDLE, AND RIDE MANKIND-----------"--AND HE ARGUES THAT------ "BEFORE WE COMMIT AN ENDLESS FLOW OF FORCES--------------- TO SOUTH VIETNAM, WE MUST HAVE MORE EVIDENCE THAN WE NOW HAVE THAT OUR TROOPS WILL NOT BOG DOWN IN THE JUNGLES AND RICE PADDIES-------WHILE--------------- WE SLOWLY BLOW THE COUNTRY TO PIECES.------" THEN, ON JUNE 28, 1965, IN A MEMO TITLED------ "CUTTING OUR LOSSES IN VIETNAM,------" BALL WROTE:--------------------- "THE POSITION TAKEN IN THIS MEMORANDUM DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ABDICATE LEADERSHIP IN THE COLD WAR.--------------- BUT ANY PRUDENT MILITARY COMMANDER CAREFULLY SELECTS THE TERRAIN ON WHICH TO STAND AND FIGHT, AND NO GREAT CAPTAIN HAS EVER--------------- BEEN BLAMED FOR A SUCCESSFUL TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL....POLITICALLY, SOUTH VIETNAM IS A LOST CAUSE....HANOI HAS A GOVERNMENT AND--------------- A PURPOSE AND A DISCIPLINE. THE GOVERNMENT IN SAIGON IS A TRAVESTY. IN MY VIEW, A DEEP COMMITMENT OF UNITED STATES FORCES--------------- IN A LAND WAR IN SOUTH VIETNAM WOULD BE A CATASTROPHIC ERROR. IF EVER THERE WAS AN OCCASION FOR A TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL, THIS--------------- IS IT.----------------------------------------------------------------" NOW GEORGE BALL WAS ANYTHING BUT A RADICAL. INDEPENDENT YES, BUT, AS JAMES BILL WRITES,------ "THE PROTESTS IN THE STREETS OF AMERICA--------------- HORRIFIED GEORGE BALL. IN HIS VIEW, THE MASSES OF ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTS TRAMPLED UPON THE CANONS OF CIVILITY AND DESTROYED ANY--------------- POSSIBILITY OF RATIONAL DISCOURSE. BALL COULD NO MORE WORK WITH THEM THAN HE COULD GO OFF TO HIS OFFICE DRESSED IN A BASEBALL----------------CAP, BLUE JEANS AND T-SHIRT.----------------------------------------------------------------" INDEED, BALL ALIENATED MANY LEADING ANTI-WAR FIGURES BY REFUSING TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL LATE----- 1966--BY INSISTING--------------- ON REMAINING A TEAM PLAYER, AND BY PUBLICLY--- DEFENDING---- LBJ'S VIETNAM POLICY. YET FOR ALL HIS LOYALTY TO THE TEAM, WITH HIS GOOD MANNERS, WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE, BALL WAS CONSIDERED--------------- UNRELIABLE AND UNSOUND BY HIS TEAMMATES, BY THE VAINGLORIOUS WAR MINISTERS SURROUNDING JOHNSON. TO DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT--------------- MCNAMARA, BALL------ "WAS OUT OF LINE-----------"--HE HAD FAILED TO------ "STAFF OUT------" HIS RESEARCH PROPERLY-------HE HADN'T DONE ENOUGH TO------ "DEVELOP HIS--------------- IDEAS IN COMMITTEE.------" IN SHORT, BALL WASN'T A GOOD PARTY MAN; HE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE PARTY LINE. HE WASN'T A COMMITTEE MAN; HE--------------- WASN'T A COMPANY MAN. HE WAS TOO MUCH HIS OWN MAN, WHICH IN CERTAIN QUARTERS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY IS ABOUT THE WORST THING--------------- YOU CAN BE.---------------------------------------------------------- AS IT TURNED OUT, BALL WAS RIGHT AND MCNAMARA WAS MASSIVELY WRONG. INDEED, BALL WAS SO RIGHT, THAT HAD JOHNSON FOLLOWED HIS--------------- WISE COUNSEL, MORE THAN 55,000 AMERICAN LIVES AND PERHAPS A MILLION VIETNAMESE WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS--------------- OF CHILDREN AND SPOUSES WOULD STILL HAVE HAD PARENTS AND PARTNERS, AND-TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNBORN CHILDREN...WELL, WE CAN--------------- ONLY IMAGINE THEIR POTENTIAL LIVES.---------------------------------------------------------- NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THAT SO-DISTINGUISHED AND SO PRESCIENT A-MAN AS-GEORGE BALL WOULD BE HONORED TODAY FOR HAVING BEEN SO--------------- RIGHT. PERHAPS A SCHOOL OF DIPLOMACY NAMED AFTER HIM, OR AT LEAST A CHAIRED PROFESSORSHIP AT THE GEORGETOWN SCHOOL-OF FOREIGN--------------- SERVICE OR HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT. HOW ABOUT THE GEORGE BALL ANNUAL LECTURE AT, SAY, THE ARMY WAR--------------- COLLEGE, OR AT THE SCHOOLS OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OF JOHNS HOPKINS-OR COLUMBIA? I'M AFRAID NOT; I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOTHING--------------- NAMED FOR GEORGE W. BALL. ----------------------------------------------------------AFTER HIS THANKLESS GOVERNMENT SERVICE, BALL WENT ON TO A NOT-VERY-SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN INVESTMENT BANKING. HE DIDN'T LIKE--------------- THE BUSINESS MUCH-------IT PAID THE BILLS-------AND AS A RESULT HE DIDN'T REALLY CASH IN ON HIS GOVERNMENT SERVICE, THE WAY JUST ABOUT--------------- EVERYBODY DOES TODAY.---------------------------------------------------------- IN FACT, TOWARD THE END OF HIS LIFE, GEORGE WASN'T DOING VERY WELL FINANCIALLY. JUST WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEATH IN MAY 1994, HE--------------- FELT OBLIGED TO PUT HIS LOVELY HOME IN PRINCETON-------WITH ITS-MAGNIFICENT LIBRARY-------UP FOR SALE.---------------------------------------------------------- NOW I'LL WAGER THAT A-LOT OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF ROBERT MCNAMARA, AND THAT ALMOST NONE OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF GEORGE BALL. THE--------------- VILLAIN, THE FOOL, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL HIM, IS WORLD-FAMOUS, OR WORLD INFAMOUS. HE EVEN STARRED-LAST YEAR IN AN OSCAR-WINNING--------------- DOCUMENTARY. MEANWHILE, THE CLEAR-SIGHTED MAN OF PRINCIPLE, THE-GUY WHO GOT IT RIGHT AND-WHO STUCK TO HIS GUNS, IS VIRTUALLY----------------UNKNOWN TO-THE GREATER PUBLIC. A FUNDAMENTALLY DISHONORABLE MAN IS THE CELEBRITY AND AN HONORABLE MAN IS THE GHOST. WELL,--------------- GEORGE BALL WASN'T A YES MAN, WAS HE?---------------------------------------------------------- I FIGURE THAT BY NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DRIVING AT. THERE WERE VERSIONS OF GEORGE BALL WHO WARNED AGAINST INVADING IRAQ IN--------------- THE FALL AND-WINTER OF 20-------; DO YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE? ARE THEY CELEBRATED TODAY, NOW THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AMERICANS, ---------------CLOSE TO 3,000 HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND MORE THAN TEN-THOUSAND ARABS HAVE DIED; NOW THAT YOUR FELLOW STUDENTS ARE RISKING--------------- THEIR LIVES OVERSEAS. YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF DONALD RUMSFELD AND PAUL WOLFOWITZ AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF JOHN--------------- BRADY KEISLING; HAVE YOU-REALLY HEARD OF SENATORS ROBERT BYRD AND ROBERT GRAHAM, BEYOND A PASSING MENTION?---------------------------------------------------------- DOES ANY OF THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? I DON'T MEAN IN POLITICS, BUT IN YOUR PERSONAL LIVES.-DOES GEORGE BALL BRING TO MIND MOMENTS--------------- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU WERE CALLED UPON TO TOE THE PARTY LINE, AND YOU ASKED YOURSELVES: WHAT SHOULD I DO? WHO SHOULD--------------- I BE?---------------------------------------------------------- FEW OF US WILL EVER FACE THE SORT OF CHOICES AND RESPONSIBILITIES-THAT GEORGE BALL AND ROBERT MCNAMARA FACED. BUT THEIRS IS----------------STILL AN INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE.-BECAUSE SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,------ "WOULD I RATHER END UP A FAMOUS TEAM PLAYER--------------- OR A MUCH MORE OBSCURE INDIVIDUAL WITH MY CONSCIENCE AND MY INTELLECT INTACT?----------------------------------------------------------------" WHETHER YOU VIEW YOURSELVES THIS WAY OR NOT, ALL OF THE GRADUATES OF THIS UNIVERSITY ARE, BROADLY SPEAKING, INTELLECTUALS.--------------- EDWARD SAID,-THE GREAT COLUMBIA ENGLISH PROFESSOR AND WRITER SAID THIS ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTELLECTUALS:------ "THE ROLE--------------- OF THE INTELLECTUAL IS TO ASK QUESTIONS, TO-DISTURB PEOPLE, TO STIR UP REFLECTION, TO-PROVOKE CONTROVERSY AND THOUGHT...THE--------------- ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUAL IS NEVER TO JUSTIFY POWER, TO ALWAYS BE CRITICAL OF POWER, WHETHER IT IS THE POWER OF THE WEAK OR----------------THE POWER OF THE STRONG...THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUAL-IS TO CHALLENGE POWER BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE MODELS AND, ALSO AS--------------- IMPORTANT,-RESOURCES OF HOPE.----------------------------------------------------------------" THIS ROLE IS AVAILABLE TO ANY SELF-GOVERNING CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.--------------------------------------------- OF-COURSE, ETHICAL CHOICES ARE NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE. HERE'S WHAT GEORGE BALL SAID WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HE HAD STAYED IN----------------GOVERNMENT-SERVICE LONG AFTER HIS VIEWS ON VIETNAM HAD-BEEN SPURNED, RATHER THAN RESIGN AND SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY.------ "I FIGURED--------------- THAT I COULD DO BETTER REMAINING ON THE-INSIDE. HAD I QUIT, THE STORY WOULD HAVE MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES--------------- NEXT DAY-------AND THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN PROMPTLY FORGOTTEN.'------" WELL HERE HE IS, FORGOTTEN NEVERTHELESS, HIS LESSONS UNLEARNED BY--------------- THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO KNOW WHICH CHOICE IS THE RIGHT ONE.---------------------------------------------------------- BUT IT--- IS---- EASY TO TOE THE LINE. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE, FROM ALL-SOCIAL CLASSES. IF-YOU THINK--------------- THAT MONEY IMMUNIZES YOU AGAINST THE FEAR OF REPRISAL, SOCIAL OR FINANCIAL, PLEASE THINK AGAIN. I'VE KNOWN MANY WEALTHY PEOPLE,--------------- AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT COWARDICE, TIMIDITY, PEER PRESSURE, GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG, ARE AS MUCH AT HOME IN THE SPLENDID--------------- COUNTRY CLUB AS THEY ARE IN THE MODEST SOCIAL CLUB.------ "ALL OTHER SWINDLERS UPON EARTH ARE NOTHING TO THE SELF SWINDLERS,------" WRITES--------------- DICKENS IN------ "GREAT EXPECTATIONS.------" THE RICH AND POWERFUL ARE AS PRONE TO SELF-SWINDLING AS ANYONE.---------------------------------------------------------- AS AMERICAN CITIZENS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BETTER THAN GO ALONG TO GET ALONG. WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO PARTICIPATE--------------- IN OUR OWN-GOVERNANCE. IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO WHEN WE ARE IN A MINORITY OF ONE-------WHETHER ON A--------------- JURY, IN A POLLING BOOTH, AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, OR SIMPLY DOING A REGULAR JOB IN A REGULAR PLACE OF BUSINESS.---------------------------------------------------------- AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON WERE HIT ON 9/11, THIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY AND RIGHT WERE CHALLENGED EVERY BIT--------------- AS MUCH AS GEORGE BALL WAS CHALLENGED IN---- 1964-AMERICA WAS CALLED TO NATIONAL UNITY; DISSENT WAS DISCOURAGED; EVEN IRONY--------------- WAS DENOUNCED. NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES ANYMORE. WE COULD ONLY SEE 9/11 ONE WAY-------AMERICA VICTIMIZED BY A--------------- SENSELESS ACT OF MASS MURDER WITHOUT ANY ANTECEDENTS, WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL CONTEXT. NOT EVERYBODY TOED THE LINE; A FEW PEOPLE--------------- ARGUED THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS A MONSTER INCUBATED IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY OF THE COLD WAR, THE SAME COLD WAR THAT--------------- BROUGHT US VIETNAM. LAUNCHED AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION IN AFGHANISTAN, HE FINALLY BLEW BLACK IN OUR FACES. I HAPPEN TO AGREE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUT WHATEVER MY THEORIES ABOUT THE CAUSES AND ORIGINS OF 9/11, WHAT STAYED WITH ME IN THE AFTERMATH WAS THE DREADFUL SILENCE--------------- IN THE FACE OF GROUPTHINK, OF MEDIATHINK, OF COMMITTEETHINK. NOBODY HAD TO TELL ME HOW BAD THE ACTUAL EVENT WAS; MY OFFICE--------------- WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ENVELOPED IN THE ACRID SMOKE THAT FINALLY SHIFTED UPTOWN. I HEARD MY SHARE OF NEAR MISS STORIES, AND--------------- I DID KNOW SOMEONE WHO WAS KILLED. BUT AS HARD AS I TRIED, I COULDN'T QUITE ARTICULATE WHAT I FELT ABOUT 9/LL, ABOUT MY OBJECTION--------------- TO THE PARTY LINE NARRATIVE. YES, 9/11 WAS TERRIBLE, MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND KILLED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. BUT THE STRANGE--------------- THING ABOUT IT WAS THE FOCUS ON THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES-------THE IMAGE THAT STAYED WITH MOST OF WAS NOT OF DESPERATE PEOPLE JUMPING--------------- OUT OF WINDOWS, BUT THAT OF TWO GREAT EDIFICES IN LOWER MANHATTAN COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND ONE IN WASHINGTON BADLY DAMAGED--------------- AND SET ON FIRE.---------------------------------------------------------- EVENTUALLY, SENATOR ROBERT BYRD, WHO SO NOBLY AND COURAGEOUSLY DISSENTED ON IRAQ, CLARIFIED THINGS FOR ME. BACK IN 1993, BYRD--------------- HAD SOUNDED THE ALARM ABOUT WHAT HE VIEWED AS A POWER GRAB BY THE PRESIDENT THAT BYRD THOUGHT THREATENED THE CONSTITUTION.--------------- IN ONE SPEECH, HE EXPLAINED WHAT I FELT EIGHT YEARS LATER, BUT COULDN'T EXPRESS ABOUT---- 9/SPEAKING OF GREAT BUILDINGS IN--------------- THE CAPITAL CITY-------AND REMEMBER THAT NEW YORK CITY WAS THE FIRST CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES------- BYRD SAID:------ "DOES ANYONE REALLY--------------- IMAGINE THAT THE SPLENDORS OF OUR CAPITAL CITY STAND OR FALL WITH MANSIONS, MONUMENTS, BUILDINGS, AND PILES OF MASONRY? THESE--------------- ARE BUT BRICKS AND MORTAR, LIFELESS THINGS, AND THEIR COLLAPSE OR RESTORATION MEANS LITTLE OR NOTHING WHEN MEASURED ON THE--------------- GREAT CLOCK-TOWER OF TIME.------" AND THEN BYRD QUOTED DANIEL WEBSTER, THE GREAT MASSACHUSETTS POLITICIAN OF THE PRE-CIVIL WAR ERA:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IT WERE BUT A TRIFLE EVEN IF THE WALL OF YONDER CAPITOL WERE TO CRUMBLE, IF ITS LOFTY PILLARS SHOULD FALL, AND ITS GORGEOUS--------------- DECORATIONS BE ALL COVERED BY THE DUST OF THE VALLEY. ALL THESE MIGHT BE REBUILT. BUT WHO SHALL RECONSTRUCT THE FABRIC OF--------------- DEMOLISHED GOVERNMENT? WHO SHALL REAR AGAIN THE WELL-PROPORTIONED COLUMNS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LOOK AROUND YOU NOW AND OBSERVE AND APPRECIATE YOUR FELLOW COLUMNS, EVERY ONE OF YOU A SPLENDID, WELL-PROPORTIONED TESTAMENT--------------- TO AMERICAN LIBERTY AND AMERICAN-CONSCIENCE. WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE TODAY, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE MASONRY OF YOUR MINDS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS------------------ THE COLUMNS OF LIBERTY---- BY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JOHN R. MACARTHUR----, ORIGINALLY FROM--------------- SUNDAY, MAY 23, 2004, PUBLISHED WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16,---------------------- IT IS PART OF----------------------------------------------------------
