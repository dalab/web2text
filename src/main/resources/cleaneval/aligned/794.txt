T-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------O HEADS OF-STATE OF------------------THE EUROPEAN-UNION, CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN CULTURAL----------------- ASSEMBLY, WAS SENT BY LORD YEHUDI MENUHIN, THE GREAT VIOLINIST,----------------- CONDUCTOR, AND HUMANITARIAN WHO RECEIVED THE NUCLEAR AGE PEACE----------------- FOUNDATION'S 1997 DISTINGUISHED PEACE LEADERSHIP AWARD.---------------------------------------------------------------- IN MY OPINION THERE IS ONE ELEMENT MISSING IN THE GENERAL CONCEPT----------------- OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ---IT IS THE REPRESENTATION OF THE RICH----------------- DIVERSITY OF EUROPEAN CULTURES.----------------------------------- THE PEOPLES ASPIRING TO NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY MUST----------------- BE OFFERED THE ALTERNATIVE OF CULTURAL AUTONOMY. WE CANNOT AFFORD----------------- A PROLIFERATION OF ATOM BOMBS AND-TERRORISTS, NOR CAN WE DENY----------------- ANY GROUP-ITS OWN DISTINCTIVE IDENTITY, ITS-NEEDS, TRADITIONS----------------- AND HABITAT.----------------------------------- THE POWERS OF GLOBALIZATION IN SCIENCE, IN-COMMUNICATIONS,------------------IN COMMERCE, THE-NEED TO COMBAT GLOBAL MENACES-- DISEASE, POLLUTION,----------------- DROUGHT, FAMINE---THROUGH MORE EFFECTIVE AND BROADER COOPERATION----------------- AMONGST PEOPLES MUST BE COMPENSATED BY CULTURAL AFFINITIES CONCEIVED----------------- ON THE SCALE OF THE HUMAN BEING.----------------------------------- UNTIL NOW THE SOVEREIGN STATE ACTED AS THE RESPONSIBLE----------------- MONOLITH FOR BOTH FUNCTIONS; NOW THEY MUST EACH BE REPRESENTED------------------ON THE EUROPEAN STAGE BY------------------------------------ 1) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT,-------------------- 2) THE ASSEMBLY OF CULTURES.----------------------------------- TO THIS END I AM ENGAGED IN ESTABLISHING A REPRESENTATION----------------- OF CULTURES AT THE LEVEL-OF A GREATER EUROPE. THE REPRESENTATIVES,----------------- EITHER DESIGNATED OR CHOSEN, WOULD HAVE TO ENJOY THE CONFIDENCE----------------- AND TRUST-OF THEIR GROUP, BUT THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SPEAK WITH----------------- THE AIM OF REACHING AGREEMENT..----------------------------------- THE DISCUSSIONS, CONDUCTED IN THE PRESENCE OF A----------------- MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, WOULD RESULT IN RESOLUTIONS----------------- OR IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS, IN ARBITRATION OR LEGISLATION. THE------------------DISCUSSION CONCLUDED, THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD RETURN TO HOME AND----------------- HABITUAL WORK.----------------------------------- THE MISSION, IF-SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED, WOULD -----------------ENTITLE THE SPOKESMAN OR WOMAN TO BECOME A-MEMBER OF THE FULL----------------- MEETINGS OF THE ASSEMBLY OF CULTURES. FULL MEETINGS OF THE ASSEMBLY----------------- WOULD BE HELD ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR IN BRUSSELS OR STRASBOURG.----------------- THE CULTURES WOULD ALSO REMAIN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER.----------------- THIS WOULD LEAD TO A RENUNCIATION ON THE PART OF ANY GIVEN CULTURE,----------------- OF SOVEREIGN NATIONAL AND TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS. GRADUALLY NATIONAL----------------- POLICE-AND MILITARY REQUIREMENTS WOULD TAKE ON A EUROPEAN CHARACTER,----------------- AS GREAT WORLD POWERS WOULD NO LONGER-BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND A----------------- SELF-RELIANT EUROPE.----------------------------------- MY FOUNDATION IN BRUSSELS IS ALREADY FURTHERING----------------- THIS PROJECT WITH AN OFFICE AND A QUALIFIED GENTLEMAN IN CHARGE.----------------------------------- EUROPE WOULD THUS HAVE ANOTHER CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES:----------------- THE ONE ELECTED BY THE-CITIZENS-- THE EUROPEAN-PARLIAMENT---AND----------------- THE OTHER AS A COUNTERWEIGHT----A FORUM OF-THE DIFFERENT CULTURES.----------------------------------- BOTH HOUSES WOULD FULLY CONSIDER EACH-OTHER'S ATTITUDES----------------- AND PROPOSITIONS.----------------------------------- AS I SEE IT, MR. PRIME MINISTER, THIS IS THE NEXT----------------- STAGE IN THE CONSTANT EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DEMOCRACIES.----------------------------------- I AM CONVINCED THAT AN ASSEMBLY OF CULTURES CAN----------------- PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN THE EMERGENCE OF A GENUINE EUROPEAN CONSCIENCE,----------------- WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE THE BEST DEFENSE OF ITS PEOPLES AND OF----------------- THE COMMUNITY. THE INCLUSION OF CULTURES IN EASTERN EUROPE WOULD----------------- RELEASE A PROCESS OF ACCLIMATIZATION WHEREBY GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS----------------- AND TRUST WOULD PERMEATE OUR ASSEMBLY OF CULTURES OF GREATER EUROPE,----------------- PREPARING THEM GRADUALLY FOR FULLER MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY,----------------- A MEMBERSHIP FOR WHICH THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED AS YET, EITHER ECONOMICALLY----------------- OR, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY.----------------------------------- WE CANNOT INCLUDE-IN THE EVOLVED COMMUNITY OF WESTERN----------------- EUROPE WHEREIN TERRITORIAL AMBITIONS HAVE BEEN OUTGROWN, THOSE----------------- OTHER PEOPLES WHOSE MENTALITY STILL REVERTS TO TERRITORIAL CONTROL----------------- AND EXPANSION. THEY-ARE STILL PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNEVOLVED AND UNPREPARED----------------- FOR EUROPEAN UNION.----------------------------------- THIS EVOLUTION-COULD BE IMMEDIATELY BEGUN WITH----------------- CULTURAL CONTACTS AND EXPRESSIONS IN EVERY FIELD, INCLUDING THE----------------- POLITICAL, OF WHICH EVOLUTION NEITHER THE POLITICAL PARLIAMENT----------------- OF STATES, WHICH ARE NEVER-COMPLETELY FREE OF MISTRUST, NOR THE----------------- ECONOMIC DICTATES OF PROFITABILITY IN A FREE-MARKET ARE CAPABLE.----------------- (SEE MY LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF MOSCOW.)----------------------------------- UP UNTIL NOW OUR-EUROPEAN UNION HAS NOT SHOULDERED----------------- ITS ROLE OF GUARDIAN OF CULTURES WHICH-WOULD PROTECT A HUMAN BEING,----------------- HIS HERITAGE, HIS RIGHTS, HIS CREATIVITY.----------------------------------- EUROPE WILL NOT SURVIVE ON ITS PAST RECORD ALONE,----------------- HOWEVER GREAT ARE ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMOCRACY, TO THE ARTS,----------------- THE SCIENCES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; ONLY WHEN IT WILL FINALLY----------------- GIVE A SHINING EXAMPLE OF A BALANCED, RICH, DIVERSE, MULTICOLORED------------------AND HARMONIOUS SOCIETY MAY OTHER POWERS-WISH TO EMULATE IT RATHER----------------- THAN-DESTROY IT.----------------------------------- ALSO, WHILST KEEPING OUR POWDER DRY, OUR HANDS----------------- AND OUR MINDS AND DOORS MUST BE OPEN, GENEROUS AND SHARING.----------------------------------- FOR THESE REASONS, MR. PRIME MINISTER, I WOULD----------------- ASK YOU WITH A FULL HEART TO SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CREATION----------------- OF THIS REPRESENTATION OF CULTURES, AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY----------------- IF AMONG THE MANY ISSUES YOU WILL DISCUSS YOU COULD AGREE UPON----------------- TWO POINTS:----------------------------------- 1)THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD BE-CALLED 'THE----------------- EUROPEAN UNION OF STATES AND CULTURES'----------------------------------- AND----------------------------------- 2)THAT THE EUROPEAN-UNION DECLARES ITSELF THE 'GUARDIAN----------------- OF EUROPEAN CULTURES.'----------------------------------- IN SETTING YOUR SIGHT HIGH, EVEN UPON THE UNATTAINABLE,----------------- YOU WILL ATTRACT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TO YOUR SIDE, FOR----------------- YOU WILL HAVE GIVEN THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT VISION AND THAT A----------------- FUTURE DO EXIST; THAT CLEAR AND INSPIRING, NOBLE-PURPOSES CAN----------------- STILL BE PURSUED -- AND NOT ONLY GARAGES-TO REPAIR OUTWORN, OUTDATED----------------- MECHANISMS, REFLEXES AND OBSESSIONAL THOUGHTS, NARROW, TIMID,----------------- AND VULGAR.----------------------------------- AS PRIME MINISTER YOU ARE SPOKESMAN FOR AND TO----------------- ALL YOUR PEOPLE -- RICH, POOR, OLD, YOUNG, OF ALL COLORS AND DENOMINATIONS----------------- -- AND OF ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, FOR, OF-COURSE, AS SOON AS YOU----------------- CONFINE YOURSELF TO ONE POLITICAL PARTY OR TO AN ALLIANCE YOU----------------- WILL BE OPPOSED BY OTHERS, SEVERAL OF WHICH MAY HAVE VALID ATTITUDES----------------- AND ARGUMENTS.----------------------------------- WILL YOU ALLOW ME-TO SAY THAT NEITHER THE PURPOSES,----------------- NOR THE MEASURES, NOR THE PROBLEMS, NOR-ALL THAT WHICH MAY LINK------------------THESE PROBLEMS TOGETHER, ARE PRESENTED WITH CLARITY AND AGAINST----------------- THEIR BACKGROUNDS OF WEIGHTS AND FORCES, WHICH IT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL------------------TO DO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CONVINCE A PEOPLE, CRITICAL, EXPERIENCED,----------------- TESTED AND TRIED, A PEOPLE OF ESSENTIALLY GOOD CHARACTER, YET----------------- WARY AND CYNICAL.----------------------------------- THE MEASURES WHICH YOU FEEL OBLIGED TO TAKE CONSIST------------------IN PART OF RESPONSES TO FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, WHICH------------------RELATE TO SOCIAL AND CIVIL ONES, WHICH IN THEIR TURN ARE CONNECTED----------------- TO EUROPE, TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BUT-VERY SPECIALLY TO THE QUALITY----------------- OF EDUCATION, TO-HEALTH, PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL, TO A CREATIVE,----------------- MORAL CODE BASED ON A CONSENSUS-OF VALUES, HERITAGE AND TRADITIONS,----------------- WHICH ARE AT THE VERY HEART OF A CIVILIZATION, HOWEVER COMPLEX----------------- IT MAY BE.----------------------------------- YOUR OWN POOR, SUFFERING, AGED, YOUNG, SICK, THE----------------- SAD UNEMPLOYED, ALL THE FRUSTRATED, THE MALCONTENTS, THE DRUGGED,----------------- THE ILL-INFORMED AND VIOLENT, THIS LIVING TINDER CANNOT BE IGNORED------------------- A MULTITUDE RARELY CONSIDERED BY POLITICAL PARTIES, EXCEPT GINGERLY -----------------AT ELECTION TIME.------------------------------------SOLEMN PERSONAL PROMISES WILL NOT SUFFICE.------------------------------------ MAY I SUGGEST THAT THE VERY WORDS ARE : TO WORK----------------- TOWARDS A-CIVILIZATION-FOUNDED ON-A POSITIVE-RECIPROCITY, ON THE----------------- BALANCE OF RIGHT WITH RESPONSIBILITY, AND ON DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS----------------- INCUMBENT ON ALL.----------------------------------- AS A RULE I WOULD SAY THAT RIGHTS BELONG TO THOSE----------------- AT THE MERCY OF OTHERS AND WHO LACK-AN OFFICIAL VOICE.----------------------------------- THUS, FOR INSTANCE, CHILDREN (WHO, WITHIN THEIR----------------- CAPACITY, SAFETY AND WELL-BEING SHOULD ALSO EXERCISE RESPONSIBILITY)----------------- OR THE SICK, OR TREES, WOULD HAVE RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THEIR HELPLESSNESS,----------------- WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, OTHERS BY VIRTUE OF AUTHORITY, KNOWLEDGE,----------------- SKILL, EXPERIENCE AND INFLUENCE SHOULD CARRY THE RESPONSIBILITIES;----------------- THUS, THE PASSENGER HAS RIGHTS,-WHERE THE CHAUFFEUR HAS SPECIFIC----------------- RESPONSIBILITIES; THE PATIENT-HAS THE RIGHT, THE SURGEON THE RESPONSIBILITY.----------------------------------- OUR TASK IS TO BUILD A CIVILIZATION OF POSITIVE----------------- RECIPROCITY. AN EDUCATION FOR RECIPROCITY WOULD CONCERN ITSELF----------------- WITH THE TEACHING FROM EARLIEST INFANCY OF THE VOICE, BY SONG----------------- AND SPEECH, WITH EVERYTHING WHICH IS ABSORBED AND LEARNED BY EXAMPLE----------------- AND IMITATION-- DANCE, MIME, A BODY LANGUAGE, A USE OF HANDS,----------------- MIND, HEART AND FANTASY, IN CRAFTS, ARTS, IN THOUGHTS AND SPEECH,----------------- IN POETRY, IN COMPASSION, IN WONDER. IN THIS WAY THE ABSTRACT----------------- STUDIES, BEGINNING WITH READING AND WRITING, CAN MORE EASILY SPROUT----------------- ON A HUMANELY FERTILIZED SOIL OR SOUL.----------------------------------- AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS EXACTLY THE DESCRIPTION OF----------------- WHAT I PURSUE THROUGH THE WORKS OF MY FOUNDATION (THE INTERNATIONAL----------------- YEHUDI MENUHIN FOUNDATION) (THE PROJECT IS CALLED MUS-E) IN THE----------------- MORE DIFFICULT SCHOOLS (VIOLENT AND PREJUDICED) IN-EUROPE. WE------------------NOW HAVE-A FORMAL WORKING ARRANGEMENT-WITH THE MINISTERS OF CULTURE----------------- AND EDUCATION IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL. THIS IMPROVED SOCIETY BASED----------------- ON RECIPROCITY, ON THE-MUTUALITY OF SERVICES, ON THE RECOGNITION----------------- OF OUR INTERDEPENDENCE AND UPON OUR DESIRE TO LEARN, WOULD TEND----------------- LARGELY TO REDUCE OUR EXAGGERATED DEPENDENCIES ON MONEY ITSELF.----------------------------------- I WOULD MAINTAIN THAT EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE-UNEMPLOYED,----------------- HAVE THE RIGHT TO A LIFELONG EDUCATION, TO MUSIC AND OPERA, TO----------------- THEATER AND TO SPORTS, AS WELL AS TO THE BASICS OF LIFE---EVEN----------------- HOLIDAYS (A----- "CHANGE OF AIR-----") -- PROVIDED IN PART BY -----------------SPECIAL ELECTRONIC CREDIT CARDS, BY MUTUAL SERVICES AND THE-VENUES,----------------- FACILITIES, THEATERS AND SCHOOLS, PROVIDED BY THE STATE, BY PRIVATE----------------- FUNDS, AND MAINTAINED BY THE PEOPLE WITH FREE TIME. THE FINANCIAL----------------- FIELD OF ACTION COULD THEREBY BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. PEOPLE----------------- WOULD HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO LIVE WITHOUT HURTING THEIR NEIGHBOR,----------------- WHILST ENJOYING A RECIPROCAL LIBERTY AND SERVING, AS THEY CAN----------------- AND MAY BE INCLINED TO, THE NEEDS OF OTHERS. ON SUCH A BASIS A----------------- HEALTHY CAPITALISM COULD FLOURISH, NEVER EXCEEDING THE LIMITS----------------- IMPOSED BY POLLUTION, BY THE ABUSE OF NATURE, OF OUR MOTHER EARTH,----------------- OF OUR RESOURCES, NEVER BREAKING ALL BOUNDS IN THE SALE OF ARMS,----------------- DRUGS, CHILDREN, NOR IN POISONS OF ALL SORTS WHICH APPARENTLY----------------- SHARE OUR ECONOMIES.----------------------------------- I WOULD PROPOSE THAT SALARIES BE RELATED NOT ONLY----------------- TO THE EMPLOYER'S RESOURCES BUT ALSO TO A GIVEN, REGIONAL, NATIONAL----------------- (A EUROPEAN) INCOME. THUS SALARIES WOULD ADJUST TO THE GIVEN WELL-BEING----------------- OF A COUNTRY.----------------------------------- WE MUST RETHINK BASIC RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.----------------- THESE ARE ALL TO LIFE, OURS AND ALL OTHER LIVES AND ALL LIFE UPON----------------- WHICH WE DEPEND, AND NOT TO MONEY ALONE.----------------------------------- FORGIVE ME IF I ALLOW MYSELF TO SEIZE ONE OF THOSE----------------- RARE MOMENTS OF HISTORICAL OPPORTUNITY TO URGE YOU TO ENGAGE UPON----------------- A RENEWAL OF OPTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME A RETURN TO CERTAIN----------------- CODES PRONOUNCED SOME TWO THOUSAND AND MORE YEARS AGO.----------------------------------- RESPECTFULLY,-------------------------------------------------------- YEHUDI MENUHIN------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
