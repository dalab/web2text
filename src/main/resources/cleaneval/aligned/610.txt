ALTHOUGH THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE BEING HARASSED-- WITH SUCH WEAPONS, THESE ARMS HAVE FLOWED TO CENTRAL AMERICA BOTH LEGALLY------WITH THE-- APPROVAL OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT------AND ILLEGALLY. UNDER U.S. LAW (ARMS EXPORT CONTROL-- ACT), ANY U.S. NATIONAL OR U.S. REGISTERED CORPORATION, OR ANY PERSON OR CORPORATION-- RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES, MUST OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM THE-GOVERNMENT TO EXPORT ANY-- MUNITION. OTHER LAWS (NATIONAL SECURITY ACT, FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT) GIVE THE U.S.-- GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER WEAPONS-ON A SALE OR-GRANT BASIS------OVERTLY OR-- COVERTLY.---------------------------------------WEAPONS----- "MADE-IN THE USA-------HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO-- CENTRAL AMERICA PRINCIPALLY IN FOUR WAYS:----------------------------------------  ON-GOING COMMERCIAL SALES, NEGOTIATED BY THE ARMS INDUSTRY OR A-------MIDDLE MAN-AND APPROVED FOR EXPORT BY THE STATE AND COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS;--------------------------------------------------------  OPEN (TRANSPARENT) GOVERNMENT-NEGOTIATED MILITARY AID OR SALES;--------------------------------------------------------  CLANDESTINE GOVERNMENT-SUPPLIED-ARMS (USUALLY BY THE CIA); AND-------------------------------------------------------  ILLEGAL PURCHASE AND SHIPMENT FROM-THE UNITED-STATES BY PRIVATE------ ACTORS OPERATING FOR FINANCIAL GAIN.---------------------------------------------  THIS PAPER BRIEFLY DESCRIBES WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT COLD WAR-ERA,-- RECENT PAST, AND ON-GOING SMALL ARMS SUPPLY TO THE REGION THROUGH EACH OF THESE-PROGRAMS. ---------------------------------------------------------------COMMERCIAL ARMS SALES----------------------------------------------------------------  HISTORICALLY, AND CONTINUING ON-THROUGH-TODAY, THE-VAST-- MAJORITY OF SMALL ARMS EXPORTS FROM-AMERICA OCCUR-THROUGH DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES (DCS),-- NEGOTIATED BETWEEN U.S. COMPANIES OR BROKERS AND FOREIGN BUYERS. THE FOREIGN CUSTOMER MAY-- BE A GOVERNMENT ENTITY (---E.G.----, INTERIOR MINISTRY, JUSTICE MINISTRY, MINISTRY OF --DEFENSE, OR NATIONAL POLICE), A CORPORATION OR PERSON USING THE WEAPONS FOR PRIVATE-- SECURITY, OR A GUN VENDOR.-------------------------------------  DIRECT COMMERCIAL SALES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S-- OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS OR THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'-----S BUREAU OF EXPORT-- ADMINISTRATION, DEPENDING ON THE EQUIPMENT. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REGULATES TRANSFERS OF-- 12-GAUGE SHOTGUNS AND COMPONENTS AND SHOTGUN SHELLS, AS WELL AS STUN GUNS AND SHOCK-- BATONS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OTHER GUN EXPORTS, INCLUDING-- NON-MILITARY RIFLES AND PISTOLS.------------------------------------  SOME STATE DEPARTMENT-LICENSED SALES ARE SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL-- NOTIFICATION BEFORE EXPORT LICENSES MAY BE GRANTED. FOR SALES OVER $14 MILLION CONGRESS-- MUST BE GIVEN 15-30 DAYS PRE-NOTICE. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT-LICENSED SALES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO-- ANY PRIOR CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY.-------------------------------------  IN GENERAL, WHEN THE CUSTOMER IS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY, THE CHOICE-- OF WHETHER TO USE THE GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CHANNEL OR TO DEAL-DIRECTLY WITH THE ARMS-- MANUFACTURER OR BROKER IS UP TO THE PURCHASER. DIRECT SALES ARE QUICKER, SOMETIMES CHEAPER-- AND ENTAIL LESS OVERSIGHT THAN DO GOVERNMENT-NEGOTIATED SALES. IN ADDITION, BOTH-THE-- COMMERCE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE LESS TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE DEALS THEY ARE LICENSING-- THAN THE PENTAGON IS-ABOUT SALES-IT IS NEGOTIATING. MANY FOREIGN CUSTOMERS HAVE VIEWED-- THIS SECRECY WITH FAVOR, AND THEREFORE PREFER-TO PURCHASE ARMS DIRECTLY FROM-- MANUFACTURERS.------------------------------------  PRIOR TO 1996 IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN ANY-- INFORMATION ABOUT STATE DEPARTMENT-LICENSED SMALL ARMS EXPORTS TO CENTRAL AMERICA OR-- ELSEWHERE. BEGINNING IN THAT YEAR, HOWEVER, CONGRESS CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE AN-- ANNUAL HIGHLY SPECIFIC REPORT ON EXPORT LICENSE AUTHORIZATIONS GRANTED IN THE PRECEDING-- YEAR. THIS REPORT IS KNOWN AS THE----- "SECTION 655 REPORT---------"--AFTER THE PROVISION-- OF LAW MANDATING IT.---------------------------------------ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, DURING 1996 AND 1997, THE U.S.-- GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZED AT LEAST $110 MILLION WORTH OF SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS TO THE-- REGION.(1)------ INCLUDED IN THIS WERE NEARLY 190,000 GUNS-OF VARIOUS-TYPES (HANDGUNS-- THROUGH MACHINE GUNS). EL SALVADOR AND MEXICO WERE BY FAR THE LEADING DESTINATIONS FOR-- THESE WEAPONS DURING THESE TWO YEARS, WITH THE FORMER SLATED TO RECEIVE UP TO 33,000 GUNS-- AND THE LATER 43,-----IN ADDITION, NEIGHBORING VENEZUELA HAS BEEN CLEARED TO RECEIVE MORE --THAN 75,000 GUNS DURING THIS TIME. SEE APPENDIX 1 FOR PROFILES OF U.S. ARMS EXPORT-- AUTHORIZATIONS TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA.------------------------------------  BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENT PREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO RELEASE---- ANY------- INFORMATION ABOUT SMALL ARMS SALES IT HAD LICENSED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE-- RELATIVE CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS OR LICENSES OVER TIME. HOWEVER, THE STATE-- DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS REPORTED IN MID-1994 THAT IT HAD EXPERIENCED-- A RECENT NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR FIREARM AND AMMUNITION-- EXPORTS.(2)------ AND DATA OBTAINED BY CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS SHOWED THAT DURING THE-- FIVE YEAR PERIOD 1989-1993 THE STATE DEPARTMENT GRANTED 1,600 EXPORT LICENSES FOR OVER-- $100 MILLION OF PISTOLS, REVOLVERS AND RIFLES TO EIGHT LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.(3)--------- THUS, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SMALL ARMS EXPORT LICENSES HAVE INCREASED RATHER-- DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PERIOD 1996-1997, EQUALLING IN THOSE TWO YEARS THE LEVEL OF SMALL-- ARMS LICENSED DURING---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989- TABLE 1: VALUE AND------ QUANTITY OF COMMERCIAL EXPORT LICENSES FOR SMALL ARMS,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989-1993  VALUE OF LICENSES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NO.

THE LICENSES-- ARE VALID FOR FOUR YEARS, AND IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THESE-- LICENSES RESULT IN ACTUAL DELIVERY OF THE WEAPONS.-------------------------------------  GOVERNMENT-NEGOTIATED SALES/GRANTS-------------------------------------  THROUGH THE FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) PROGRAM, THE U.S.-- GOVERNMENT (REPRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT) NEGOTIATES WEAPONS TRANSFERS DIRECTLY-- WITH FOREIGN MILITARIES. FMS MAY COVER SALES OR GRANTS OF NEW EQUIPMENT (PURCHASED BY THE-- PENTAGON FROM U.S. WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS AND IN EFFECT RE-SOLD TO FOREIGN MILITARIES),-- COPRODUCTION OF WEAPONS OVERSEAS, OR TRANSFERS FROM SURPLUS-PENTAGON STOCKS.-------------------------------------  AN FMS DEAL IS USUALLY INITIATED WITH A REQUEST FOR WEAPONS-- TRANSMITTED FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN THE CUSTOMER COUNTRY TO THE----- "IMPLEMENTING-- AGENCY---------"--THE ARMY OR THE DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY IN THE CASE OF SMALL/LIGHT-- ARMS. COPIES OF THE REQUEST ARE SENT TO SEVERAL RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING-- THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF POLITICO-MILITARY AFFAIRS, THE DEFENSE SECURITY-- COOPERATION AGENCY (DSCA) IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND THE UNIFIED-- COMMAND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGION WHERE THE CUSTOMER COUNTRY IS LOCATED. IF NO OBJECTIONS-- ARE RAISED, THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DSCA, BEGINS TO PREPARE THE-- CONTRACT FOR THE ARMS PACKAGE. BY LAW, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION MUST NOTIFY CONGRESS-- 15-30 DAYS BEFORE OFFERING A SALES CONTRACT TO A FOREIGN CUSTOMER, IF THE PROPOSED SALE IS-- VALUED AT $14 MILLION OR MORE.-------------------------------------  UNTIL RECENTLY, THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON PAST SHIPMENTS-- OF GOVERNMENT-BROKERED SMALL ARMS SALES WAS THROUGH SUBMISSION OF A REQUEST UNDER THE-- FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), A LAW DIRECTING THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RELEASE ALL-- REQUESTED INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC THAT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE (NATIONAL SECURITY-- AND FOREIGN POLICY REASONS ARE GROUNDS FOR EXEMPTION). DETAILED INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM-- THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IN 1994 SHOWED THAT BETWEEN 1980-93, THE PENTAGON TRANSFERRED-- NEARLY 50,000 PISTOLS, OVER 170,000 RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS, NEARLY 1,000 SUBMACHINE GUNS, AND-- MORE THAN---,000 GRENADE LAUNCHERS TO 49 COUNTRIES THROUGH FMS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING-- QUANTITIES TO THE ARMED FORCES OF EL SALVADOR:----------------------------------------  TABLE 2: U.S. FOREIGN MILITARY SALES SHIPMENTS OF SMALL---ARMS/LIGHT WEAPONS TO EL SALVADOR,----------------------------------------- 1982-1991  33,274 M16 ASSAULT RIFLES------  3,120 40MM GRENADE LAUNCHERS-----------,000 HAND GRENADES----------------------------------------------------  SOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DEFENSE SECURITY-- ASSISTANCE AGENCY), RESPONSE TO REQUEST BY FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS UNDER FREEDOM-- OF INFORMATION ACT, 14 SEPTEMBER---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IN ADDITION TO SALES OF NEWLY-MANUFACTURED WEAPONS, THE PENTAGON-- GIVES AWAY OR SELLS AT DEEP DISCOUNT THE VAST OVERSUPPLY OF SMALL/LIGHT WEAPONS THAT IT-- HAS IN ITS POST COLD-WAR INVENTORY. MOST OF THIS SURPLUS IS DISPENSED THROUGH THE EXCESS-- DEFENSE ARTICLES (EDA) PROGRAM.-------------------------------------  THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT DEFINES EDA AS WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS-- OWNED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH WERE--- NOT---- PROCURED IN ANTICIPATION OF MILITARY-- AID OR SALES. ORIGINALLY ONLY THE SOUTHERN-TIER MEMBERS OF NATO WERE CLEARED TO RECEIVE-- EDA, BUT FOLLOWING THE 1991 GULF WAR, MANY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN STATES WERE-- ADDED; ANTI-NARCOTICS AID PROVISIONS EXPANDED EDA ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE SOUTH AMERICAN-- AND CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES.------------------------------------  AROUND 1995, LARGE SCALE GRANTS AND SALES OF SMALL/LIGHT ARMS-- BEGAN OCCURRING. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, OVER 300,000 RIFLES, PISTOLS, MACHINE GUNS AND-- GRENADE LAUNCHERS HAVE BEEN OFFERED UP, INCLUDING THE OFFER OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF M--1 RIFLES TO MEXICO AND SMALL ARMS TO------- COLOMBIA AND STATES IN THE CARIBBEAN IN-- FURTHERANCE OF THE----- "WAR ON DRUGS.-----------------------------------------"  SURPLUS WEAPONS ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS UNDER-- SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO----- "DRAW DOWN-----" U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO MEET-- EMERGENCY NEEDS. THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT PROVIDES PERMISSION FOR THE PRESIDENT TO-- TRANSFER ON A GRANT BASIS UP TO $150 MILLION WORTH OF MILITARY ARTICLES FROM U.S. STOCKS-- ANNUALLY. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS USED THIS PROVISION INCREASINGLY IN RECENT YEARS,-- PARTICULARLY IN SUPPORT OF COUNTER-NARCOTICS EFFORTS. U.S. LAW REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO-- NOTIFY CONGRESS OF ANY PLANNED DRAWDOWNS OF EQUIPMENT, AND ALSO TO NOTIFY CONGRESS UPON-- COMPLETION OF DELIVERY.--------------------------------------------------------  COVERT GOVERNMENT ARMS SUPPLY OPERATIONS--------------------------------------------------------  CLANDESTINE U.S. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS ARE ANOTHER-- WAY IN WHICH SMALL/LIGHT WERE EXPORTED FROM OR BY AMERICA TO THE REGION. TECHNICALLY-- SPEAKING, SUCH TRANSFERS ARE NOT ILLEGAL UNDER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL LAW------ALTHOUGH-- THEY CERTAINLY VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF THE U.N. CHARTER. THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF-- 1947 AUTHORIZES COVERT POLITICAL AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING SECRET ARMS SUPPLY. THE-- PRESIDENT MUST FIRST MAKE A----- "FINDING-----" THAT THE OPERATION IS VITAL TO U.S.-- NATIONAL SECURITY. SECTION 505 OF THE ACT REQUIRES THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, OR-- OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ENGAGING IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, TO NOTIFY THE CONGRESSIONAL-- COMMITTEES RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES OF ANY ARMS-- SUPPLY OPERATION UNDERTAKEN VALUED AT $1 MILLION OR MORE.-------------------------------------  BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ARE CLASSIFIED, LITTLE IS KNOWN WITH ANY-- PRECISION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY, MAGNITUDE AND SPECIFICS OF COVERT ARMS SUPPLY. IN RECENT-- YEARS, HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN DECLASSIFIED ON SOME OF THE EARLIER-- OPERATIONS IN THE REGION, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES'----- SUPPLY OF ARMS TO THE REBEL-- FORCES OF COLONEL CARLOS CASTILLO ARMAS IN GUATEMALA IN 1954, AND TO THE CUBAN EXILE-- FORCES INVOLVED IN THE ABORTIVE BAY OF PIGS INVASION OF 1961.(4)-------------------------------------  MORE RECENTLY, IT IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT DURING THE REAGAN-- ADMINISTRATION COVERT ARMS SUPPLY OPERATIONS RUN BY THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (OR-- THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL) WERE A MAJOR SOURCE OF SMALL/LIGHT ARMS TO INSURGENT GROUPS-- AROUND THE WORLD. THESE OPERATIONS ARMED, TRAINED AND FINANCED GUERRILLAS FIGHTING-- COMMUNIST-BACKED STATE FORCES IN NICARAGUA, ANGOLA, AFGHANISTAN AND CAMBODIA. SOME OF THE-- WEAPONRY SUPPLIED WAS MANUFACTURED IN AMERICA; SOME, IN AN EFFORT TO HIDE U.S. SUPPORT OF-- THE OPERATION, WAS NOT.------------------------------------  PROBABLY THE MOST DOCUMENTED COVERT ARMS-SUPPLY OPERATION EVER-- UNDERTAKEN BY A U.S. ADMINISTRATION WAS THE----- "IRAN-CONTRA-----" AFFAIR OF THE-- MID-1980S. THIS EFFORT WAS INITIATED IN 1981, WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN SIGNED A CLASSIFIED------- "FINDING-----" TO THE EFFECT THAT U.S. SECURITY WOULD BE ENHANCED BY PROVIDING COVERT-- SUPPORT FOR PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST----- "THE CUBAN PRESENCE AND CUBAN-SANDINISTA-- SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN NICARAGUA AND ELSEWHERE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.-----"(5)--------- ULTIMATELY, THIS OPERATION RESULTED IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS-------' WORTH OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION TO THE ANTI-SANDINISTA INSURGENTS IN NICARAGUA AND, WHEN THE-- SCHEME WAS FINALLY UNCOVERED, IN FELONY CHARGES AGAINST SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE REAGAN-- ADMINISTRATION.(6)------------------------------------  IN ARMING THE CONTRAS, U.S. OPERATIVES GENERALLY SOUGHT WEAPONS OF-- SOVIET OR EASTERN BLOC MANUFACTURE, THEREBY ALLOWING THE INSURGENTS TO EMPLOY AMMUNITION-- CAPTURED FROM THE SANDINISTA ARMY, WHICH WAS LARGELY EQUIPPED WITH SOVIET-TYPE WEAPONRY.-- (THE USE OF SOVIET-TYPE WEAPONS ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR THE CONTRAS AND THEIR BACKERS TO-- CLAIM THAT THEY WERE OBTAINING THEIR ARMS FROM DEFECTORS OR FALLEN SANDINISTA SOLDIERS,-- RATHER THAN FROM THE UNITED STATES.) TO OBTAIN SUCH ARMS, THE CIA DREW ON A VARIETY OF-- SOURCES. IN MAY 1983, FOR INSTANCE, RETIRED AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD SECORD, ACTING-- ON BEHALF OF CIA DIRECTOR WILLIAM CASEY SECRETLY OBTAINED SEVERAL TONS OF SOVIET-TYPE-- MUNITIONS THAT HAD BEEN CONFISCATED FROM PLO FORCES BY THE ISRAELIS IN------ THESE-- WEAPONS, AND ADDITIONAL EX-PLO MUNITIONS ACQUIRED FROM ISRAEL IN MARCH-JULY 1984, WERE-- THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CIA AND, THROUGH A VARIETY OF CLANDESTINE CHANNELS, PASSED ON TO-- THE CONTRAS.(7)-------------------------------------  ALTHOUGH THE FULL EXTENT OF COVERT ARMS AID TO THE CONTRAS HAS-- NEVER BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS SUBSTANTIAL. IN-- ONE MEMO SENT TO CIA DIRECTOR WILLIAM CASEY IN JULY 1986, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL JOHN-- SINGLAUB (A KEY FIGURE IN THE COVERT SUPPLY OPERATION) DISCUSSED A PENDING DELIVERY OF-- 10,000 KALASHNIKOV AKM ASSAULT RIFLES, 200 RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 200 60 MM MORTARS,-- 50 82 MM MORTARS, 60 12.7 MM MACHINE GUNS, 50 SA-7 PORTABLE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, AND-- RELATED AMMUNITION.(8)------ OTHER EVIDENCE OF LARGE ARMS SHIPMENTS COMES FROM THE-- TRANSCRIPTS OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE CONTRAS AND THEIR CONTACTS AT THE CIA. ON-- APRIL 12, 1986, FOR INSTANCE, A REBEL FIELD COMMANDER RADIOED A CIA OFFICIAL TO-- ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS FORCES HAD JUST RECEIVED AN AIRDROP OF 20,000 POUNDS OF MILITARY-- EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING GERMAN-TYPE G3 ASSAULT RIFLES, RIFLE MAGAZINES AND AMMUNITION, RPG---7 ROCKETS, GRENADES, AND GRENADE LAUNCHERS.(9)------ BECAUSE SUPPLY OPERATIONS OF THIS TYPE-- WERE CONDUCTED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IT IS CLEAR THAT SUBSTANTIAL-- QUANTITIES OF SMALL ARMS AND OTHER LIGHT WEAPONS WERE GIVEN TO THE CONTRAS DURING THIS-- PERIOD.------------------------------------  THESE SUPPLY OPERATIONS WOULD HAVE CONTINUED HAD NOT AN-- ENTERPRISE-OWNED FAIRCHILD C-123K CARGO PLANE BEEN SHOT DOWN ON OCTOBER 5, 1986, WHILE-- DROPPING GUNS AND AMMUNITION OVER SOUTHERN NICARAGUA. THE SOLE SURVIVING CREW MEMBER,-- EUGENE HASENFUS, WAS CAPTURED BY THE SANDINISTA ARMY, AND, UNDER INTERROGATION, TOLD HIS-- CAPTORS THAT THE CONTRA RESUPPLY FLIGHTS WERE PART OF A CIA-SANCTIONED OPERATION.------------------------------------  IN ADDITION TO AIDING THE CONTRAS, THE UNITED STATES PROVIDED-- COVERT ASSISTANCE TO SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS IN GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS DURING-- THE 1980S AND (IN THE CASE OF GUATEMALA) THE EARLY 1990S. THESE UNITS------THE D-2 BRANCH-- OF THE GUATEMALAN MILITARY AND BATTALION 316 OF THE HONDURAN MILITARY------WERE-- RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND, IN MANY CASES, MURDERING MEMBERS OF OPPOSITION POLITICAL-- MOVEMENTS. TYPICALLY, THE VICTIMS OF THESE AGENCIES WERE BEATEN, TORTURED, AND THEN------- "DISAPPEARED---------"--THAT IS, EXECUTED IN SECRET, WITH THEIR REMAINS HIDDEN IN-- UNMARKED BURIAL SITES. WHILE CONDEMNING SUCH BEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC, THE REAGAN AND BUSH-- ADMINISTRATIONS SECRETLY APPROVED THE TRANSFER OF CIA FUNDS AND EQUIPMENT TO THESE UNITS-- ON THE PREMISE THAT THEIR ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED IN THE STRUGGLE TO WIPE OUT COMMUNISM IN-- CENTRAL AMERICA.(10)------ LATER, WHEN THE COLD WAR DREW TO A CLOSE, THE UNITED STATES-- CONTINUED ITS SUPPORT------ESTIMATED AT $3-5 MILLION PER YEAR------FOR THE GUATEMALAN D-2,-- IN ORDER (IT WAS CLAIMED) TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE-- REGION.(11)------------------------------------  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SMALL ARMS WERE AMONG THE ITEMS DIRECTLY-- FURNISHED TO THESE AGENCIES BY THE CIA. GIVEN WASHINGTON'S DESIRE TO BOOST THEIR-- EFFECTIVENESS, HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CIA PROVIDED THEM WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION-- OR WITH THE FUNDS TO ACQUIRE THEM.---------------------------------------------  ILLEGAL EXPORTS----------------------------------------------  THE FINAL SOURCE OF AMERICAN SMALL AND LIGHT ARMS TO THE REGION IS-- COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF U.S. LAW------BLACK MARKET, OR----- "ILLICIT-----" ARMS TRANSFERS.-- IN HIS KEY NOTE SPEECH BEFORE THE---- 50^TH------ ANNIVERSARY OPENING OF THE U.N. GENERAL-- ASSEMBLY IN 1995, PRESIDENT CLINTON RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE ILLICIT ARMS MARKET, AND ITS-- ROLE IN SUPPLYING DRUG TRAFFICKERS, TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS. THE U.S. PRESIDENT'S FOCUS-- ON THE ILLICIT ARMS TRAFFIC WAS SPURRED, IN LARGE PART, BY THE GROWING CONCERNS OF THE-- MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE PROLIFERATION OF ILLEGAL U.S. WEAPONS INTO THE HANDS OF-- MEXICAN DRUG-TRAFFICKERS AND OTHER CRIMINALS. ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO-- AND FIREARMS (BATF), MEXICO IS ONE OF THE LEADING RECIPIENTS OF ILLICITLY EXPORTED U.S.-- WEAPONS: IN 1993, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS REPORTED 6,238 UNLAWFULLY ACQUIRED U.S.-ORIGIN-- FIREARMS TO THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS. OVER HALF------3,----376--WERE-- DISCOVERED IN MEXICO.(12)------ GUNS FLOW FROM AND THROUGH AMERICA TO MEXICO AND BEYOND IN-- SEVERAL WAYS.-------------------------------------  ON 14 MARCH 1997, U.S. FEDERAL AGENTS OPENED TWO CRATES IN A------- "LEFT CARGO-----" HOLD AT THE OTAY MESA BORDER CROSSING NEAR SAN DIEGO, UNCOVERING-- THE LARGEST ILLEGAL SHIPMENT OF ARMS EVER INTERCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES---- EN ROUTE------- TO MEXICO. THE WEAPONS------THOUSANDS OF UNASSEMBLED GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND PARTS FOR M--2 AUTOMATIC RIFLES------HAD BEEN SITTING UNCLAIMED FOR TWO MONTHS. THE SHIPMENT HAD-- ORIGINATED IN VIETNAM, WHERE AMERICA LEFT BEHIND LARGE QUANTITIES OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING M--2 AUTOMATIC RIFLES. BEFORE THE ARMS RETURNED-HOME, THEY WERE WELL-TRAVELED, HAVING GONE FROM-- HO CHI MINH CITY-TO SINGAPORE TO BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY, THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL AND UP TO-- LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA, WHERE THE WEAPONS ENTERED THE UNITED STATES IN TWO LARGE, SEALED-- CONTAINERS.(13)------ THE CONTENTS WERE FALSELY REPRESENTED AS HAND TOOLS AND STRAP-- HANGERS, BUT U.S. CUSTOMS AT LONG BEACH DID NOT INSPECT THE CARGO, SINCE THE SHIPMENT WAS------- "IN-BOND---------"--THAT IS, THE ITEMS WERE SIMPLY TRANSITING THE UNITED STATES TO-- MEXICO. IN-BOND CARGO CONTAINERS TYPICALLY REMAIN SEALED AS THEY MOVE FROM SHIP TO TRUCK-- TO BORDER. LUCKILY, THIS SHIPMENT WAS HELD UP AT THE BORDER BECAUSE THE MEXICAN FREIGHT-- FORWARDER-COMMISSIONED TO GET THE CRATES TO MEXICO CITY-DID NOT HAVE AN-ADDRESS FOR THE-- PURCHASER.(--)-------------------------------------  THE IN-BOND SYSTEM IS BUILT ON TRUST, AND ON-THE CUSTOMS---DEPARTMENT'S LACK OF RESOURCES. CUSTOMS HAS FEWER-THAN 135 INSPECTORS AT THE PORT OF LONG-- BEACH, THE NATION'S BUSIEST PORT.(15)------ NEVERTHELESS, THE CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT HAS-- SUCCESSFULLY THWARTED A NUMBER OF ILLEGAL ARMS EXPORT EFFORTS, MANY OF THEM INVOLVING-- SMALL ARMS SHIPMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, IN 1997 SEVERAL DEFENDANTS WERE INDICTED FOR-- ATTEMPTING TO EXPORT ILLEGALLY 53 AR-15 RIFLES FROM THE UNITED STATES TO COLOMBIA. IN-- ANOTHER CASE IN 1997, CUSTOMS BLOCKED AN ATTEMPT TO IMPORT SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES FROM-- BULGARIA FOR TRANSHIPMENT TO COLOMBIA. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED A-- FORMER VENEZUELAN SECRET SERVICE AGENT FOR THE UNLAWFUL SHIPMENT OF 120 FIREARMS TO-- VENEZUELA BETWEEN 1993-95.(16)------ UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT-- PERCENTAGE OF THE ILLEGAL TRADE FROM THE UNITED STATES TO CENTRAL AMERICA IS BEING-- INTERCEPTED.-------------------------------------  LARGE AND RELATIVELY WELL-ORGANIZED ARMS SHIPMENTS LIKE THE ONE-- INTERCEPTED IN SAN DIEGO ARE THOUGHT TO BE UNUSUAL. A MORE ROUTINE WAY OF SMUGGLING ARMS-- ACROSS THE BORDER IS THE---- HORMIGA----- (ANT) RUN: REPEATED TRIPS ACROSS THE BORDER WITH-- ONE OR A FEW GUNS. A LEGALLY ELIGIBLE OR----- "STRAW-----" PURCHASER BUYS A FEW WEAPONS-- (OFTEN CHEAP .22 AND .25 CALIBER PISTOLS,--------- SPECIALS,-------AND 9MM PISTOLS) FROM-- GUN STORES IN EL PASO AND OTHER AMERICAN BORDER TOWNS AND HANDS-THEM OVER TO THE-- TRAFFICKER, WHO SMUGGLES THEM ACROSS THE BORDER, GENERALLY EITHER ON FOOT OR IN THE TRUNK-- OF A CAR. THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED THOUSANDS OF TIMES A YEAR, AS SMUGGLERS MAKE REPEATED-- TRIPS TO GUN STORES AND SHOWS IN FLORIDA, TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA, IN PARTICULAR.(17)------------------------------------  SOME LEGAL-CONSTRAINTS ARE NOW IN PLACE, BUT LACK OF INVESTIGATIVE-- AND REGULATORY RESOURCES REDUCE THEIR EFFICACY. THE----- "BRADY BILL-----" MANDATES A-- NATIONAL SYSTEM OF BACKGROUND CHECKS PRIOR TO GUN PURCHASES. AND A RULE RECENTLY ENACTED-- BY THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION REQUIRES PURCHASERS TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE LIVED FOR AT-- LEAST THREE MONTHS IN THE STATE WHERE THEY ARE BUYING A GUN. IN ADDITION, THE 1994 ASSAULT-- WEAPONS BAN CURBS PURCHASES BY CIVILIANS OF AUTOMATIC AND SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.-------------------------------------  THE FIREARMS OWNERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1986 (SPONSORED BY THE-- NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION) REQUIRES THAT MULTIPLE SALES BE REPORTED TO THE BATF AND LOCAL-- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, SO THAT THEY CAN MONITOR MULTIPLE GUN PURCHASES AND INVESTIGATE-- IF THEY SUSPECT CRIMINAL INTENT. BUT CURRENTLY ONLY THREE STATES------VIRGINIA, MARYLAND-- AND SOUTH CAROLINA------HAVE LAWS THAT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BUYING MORE THAN ONE GUN A-- MONTH. IN ALL OTHER STATES, STRAW PURCHASERS CAN BUY SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF GUNS AND-- AMMUNITION FROM GUN DEALERS AT ONE TIME AND PASS THEM ON TO SMUGGLERS FOR CLANDESTINE-- SHIPMENT.-A 1991 BATF REPORT DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING A-- 1989 CASE IN WHICH THREE ARIZONA RESIDENTS PURCHASED 93 ASSAULT RIFLES AND 22 HANDGUNS FOR A-- WELL KNOWN MEXICAN NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER, WHO THEN SMUGGLED THEM INTO MEXICO.(18)------------------------------------  U.S. AND FOREIGN MILITARY DEPOTS ARE ANOTHER LIKELY SOURCE OF-- BLACK-MARKET ARMS SUPPLY. IN 1993, THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE (GAO) FOUND THAT SMALL-- ARMS PARTS WERE ROUTINELY STOLEN FROM A NUMBER OF U.S. MILITARY REPAIR-SHOPS AND --WAREHOUSES. THE PARTS WERE THEN SOLD TO-GUN DEALERS OR TO WALK-IN CUSTOMERS AT GUN SHOWS---AROUND THE-UNITED STATES. GAO INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE MILITARY SMALL ARMS-- PARTS AT 13 OF 15 GUN SHOWS THEY VISITED. THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY EVERYTHING NEEDED TO-- CONVERT A SEMIAUTOMATIC AR-15 RIFLE INTO A FULLY AUTOMATIC M16, AS WELL AS 30-ROUND M--16 MAGAZINE CLIPS STILL IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGES.(19)------ GIVEN THE PAUCITY OF END-USE-- CHECKS PERFORMED ON U.S.-SUPPLIED ARMS (SEE TABLE 1), IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT-- THEFT OF U.S.-SUPPLIED SMALL ARMS FROM DEPOTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA CONTRIBUTES TO THE BLACK-- MARKET IN ARMS, AS WELL.-------------------------------------  [APPENDIX 1 DELETED:------ IT WAS A PRINTOUT FROM THE SMALL ARMS-- DATABASE OF US SMALL ARMS AUTHORIZATIONS TO COUNTRIES OF THE REGION DURING 1996-97.--------------------------------------------]  NOTES----------------------------------------------------------------------  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND U.S.-- DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,---- FOREIGN MILITARY ASSISTANCE ACT REPORT TO CONGRESS, FISCAL YEAR------- 1996, SEPTEMBER 1997; AND THE SAME FOR FISCAL YEAR---------------------------------------------  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE,--- DEFENSE TRADE NEWS----, VOL. 5,-- NO. 3 (JULY AND OCTOBER 1994), P.------------------------------------------  U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS,--- A REVIEW OF-- ARMS EXPORT LICENSING----, SENATE HEARING 103-670, P.-----------------------------------------------------------  FOR AN ACCOUNT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SEE JOHN-- PRADOS,--- PRESIDENTS' SECRET WARS: CIA AND PENTAGON COVERT OPERATIONS SINCE WORLD WAR II------ (NEW YORK: WILLIAM MORROW, 1986), PP. 30-238; HARRY ROSITKZE,--- THE CIA'S SECRET-- OPERATIONS: ESPIONAGE, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND COVERT ACTION---- (NEW YORK: READER'S-- DIGEST PRESS, 1977), PP. 166-80; AND GREGORY F.
