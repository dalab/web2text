Contact with poison ivy can leave you with a rash and persistent
itch.  This native perennial grows throughout Virginia, in woods,
fields, and□sometimes in the garden.  It grows in sun or shade,□and
in wet or dry places.  Its growth habit depends on where it□is
growing, resulting in a trailing ground cover, free-standing□shrub,
or a vine supported by trees, shrubbery and fences.
□□□□
All parts of the poison ivy plant contain an oil, urushiol, which
causes□the allergic reaction.  Most poisoning occur during
the□growing season when the presence of lush foliage increases
the□chance of contact, but the dormant stems and roots of the
vine□can cause winter poisoning as well.  Individuals vary in
their□sensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead
to□increased sensitivity.  It would be a good idea for everyone
to□avoid this plant.
□□□□
Poison ivy appears in many forms.  The leaflets vary in
size,□glossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups
of three.  If you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed
of□three leaflets, you will be playing it safe.
□□□□
Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate. □The□chief
difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned when□trying to
remove it.  Wear protective clothing, including gloves, whenever□you
are working near it.  Pulling and grubbing are□effective means of
removal, though they necessitate close contact and will□probably
need to be repeated once or twice for complete control. □If time□is
not an object, the vines can be smothered by completely covering
them□with black plastic for several months.□Do not mow the plants as
this will spew bits and pieces of□poisonous material over the area.

When removing poison ivy, take□frequent breaks to change clothes
and scrub thoroughly with a□strong soap.  Wash contaminated clothing
separately.  DO NOT BURN any□plants that you physically remove.  The
resulting smoke can□cause severe lung damage if inhaled.
□□□□□
Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plant□without
getting too close to it.  Several commercial products are
available.  Check labels to find one that will control poison□ivy,
and apply it as directed.  Many of the herbicides for poison
ivy□control contain glyphosate.  This chemical is systemic. □It□is
absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, and□slowly
causes the death of the entire plant.  It must be applied to
an□actively growing plant for this process to take place; do□not
apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not be□growing.□
Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poison□ivy removal,
is nonselective and will kill any other plants it□contacts.
□□□□
Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut the
vine□at ground level.  Remove as much of the stump and roots as□you
can with a hoe or by pulling.  As regrowth occurs, apply
an□herbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth.
□With□perseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can
be□controlled.

□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□--Editor (July/27/1999)□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
I'm an environmentally sensitive landscaper and landscape designer
with a□good deal of experience in eliminating poison ivy from the
landscape. And,□little as I like the prospect of using an
herbicide, out of considerations□both for my personal health and
for the environment, the only way I've found□to get rid of
substantial colonies of poison ivy is by the careful
and□responsible use of herbicide.
□□□
You can remove a single young plant or two by grasping it through
a plastic□garbage bag and pulling it up root and all. Turn the bag
inside-out over the□plant, and it's done. (You may have some growth
return from broken roots,□but can get rid of them in the same way.)
□□□□□□□Glyphosate□□□□--the active ingredient in Roundup and Rodeo--is
sometimes□recommended for killing poison ivy. Because its active
ingredient breaks□down quickly, I initially tried to use Round-up,
but found that plants could□recover from as many as six
applications over two years. Others with whom□I've compared notes
also describe similar experiences. I've only used the□product as
sold, with glyphosate.
□□□
The only thing that seems to work, in my experience, is a
herbicide□containing □□□triclopyr□□□□. I've used Ortho Brush-b-Gon with a
great deal of□success. If I'm careful, I find I can spot-treat
individual plants without□doing much damage to what's growing
around them. For greater accuracy,□instead of spraying you can
paint the herbicide directly on the leaves.
□□□□
I hate to sound like a spokesperson for Monsanto. This company has
many sins□to answer for. And, as I've said above, I'm reluctant to
use herbicides. But□this product really does the job.
□□□
Use it with respect. Read the label and follow the directions
religiously.□Wait for a day when the winds are still. Don't use it
in or within ten feet□of a wetland. Use rubber gloves, and be
careful not to breathe the spray.□Wash up thoroughly afterwards,
and put your clothes in the wash right away.
□□□□□□□I strongly recommend against using salt to kill plants□□□□. Yes, we
use salt in□our food. But in the environment, in the quantities
required, it's toxic and□persistent--much more so than Roundup or
Brush-b-Gon. It does not break□down, and will continue to kill
anything planted on the spot until it's□thoroughly leached away--a
matter of years even in regions of high rainfall.□And even then, it
continues to be a hazard, as it leaches into the□groundwater. Using
it is much more environmentally damaging than using□herbicides
whose sale for the purpose is allowed by the EPA.

□□□Roundup□□□□ exclusively□here on a little more than 2 acres and while it
takes repeated spraying I  have had reasonable results because it
contains the ivy long enough that  other more invasive plants can
choke it out.  I am in year 4 of what I call my□experimental program

about 1/4 acre of just poison ivy plants. □I have to□completely
agree that the Ortho Brush-b-Gon product is  incredible and I apply
it with a paint brush to all large old growth stems.

I use the following on poison ivy, if it is in a place where I
want  to get rid of it:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Growing in an open area (ie. field, etc.) - Mow it with the
brush  hog. After a while, if you mow it regularly, it will
die.
□□□□□Growing up a tree - Cut the vine. If it is really big, use
a□chainsaw. If it is smaller, use what we call "nippers" (long
handled  shear like tool).
□□□□□□
Occasionally, if it is growing in a place where either 1 or 2

won't work, I spray it. For example, sometimes it will grow
on the  side of an outbuilding, but the vines are too small
and numerous to  cut easily. I use concentrated roundup
diluted in water to the  manufacturer's□specifications and
spray it. It always works for me.□As far as getting rid of the
rash, only time works for me.

I've taken out long-established vines with trunks□as big as your
arm with but two or three strategic,□thorough cuttings and a bit of
digging and pulling.  I carefully note locations of major vine
colonies□in the middle of winter here, when they're easier□to see
and brittle to cut as well.□One had completely covered a large
stone retaining wall,□at the bank to the ramp to the main barn
loft. □In winter□I removed major sections of matted vines from the
stones,□after cutting all along the perimeter of the wall. □I threw□mulch hay along the top of the wall and it killed the
poison□ivy there without further ado.□I knew□ that there'd be a good
burst of new growth from the base of  the big vine I chopped away
and dug out, but part of that□would be mowed as part of the yard
and the other would be□the rest of the project.  More runners would
pull up as□the ground thawed, too.□Then I waited until the leaf
growth was as good as it could□be before the seeds form.  I cut the
vines twice each with a□sharp action of the corn knife, two or more
inches apart,□digging aside the cut section.  That takes only
minutes.□I usually let it rot in place or at least wilt down to□a
dry brown before removing it to a composting area□for ornamental,
non-food uses. □The □□□seeds are a big□source of food□□□□ for birds and end
up under trees to a□large extent, so thick mulches can be used in
places□where mowing isn't practical, as long as they don't□extend
right up to the trees.□I search for separate smaller vines and pull
them to find all□their branches.  It's often easy that way to get
most of the  ivy in a big area just by first locating a small
number of□well-spread vines.  I have a spading fork, rake, and
hay□hook that I use to lift stubborn vines rather than cut□into the
dirt with the knife.  I also use nippers to□finish off each and
every smaller sprout in the area.□At most I'll check it to remove
any resprouts, once,□later in the season.□If I remove a plant I
replace it with something else,□and I'll mulch heavily and position
the replacements□once I see that the growth is all browned out.
