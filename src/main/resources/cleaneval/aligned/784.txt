--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SURVIVING THE NEXT VIRUS ATTACK------------------------------------- --G. MORGAN WATKINS, DEPARTMENTAL SERVICES-------- BACK IN THE SPRING OF 1988,-COMPUTER SECURITY WAS-LARGELY A MATTER OF----- "MAKE--- SURE YOU LOCK THE COMPUTER ROOM DOOR WHEN YOU'RE DONE.-----" THEN A FEW ROGUE--- PROGRAMS CALLED----- "VIRUSES-----" BEGAN TO APPEAR ON THE WEST COAST, SPREADING--- AND REPLICATING UNDERCOVER FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER AND REACHING THE UNIVERSITY--- SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. FIRST WAS THE----- "PAKISTANI BRAIN-----" VIRUS THAT STRUCK--- UT WINDOWS COMPUTERS LATE THAT SUMMER. THEN THE----- "SCORES-----" VIRUS ATTACKED--- MACINTOSHES ACROSS CAMPUS, LEAVING MANY MACHINES UNUSABLE-FOR DAYS.---- IN THESE TWO CASES, UT HAD TIME TO PREPARE A DEFENSE BECAUSE THE INTERNET HIGHWAY--- WAS STILL LARGELY UNDER CONSTRUCTION, AND VIRUSES SPREAD MOSTLY VIA SHARED DISKETTES. ---BUT DESPITE EARLY WARNINGS, UT WAS STILL-HIT HARD WHEN THE-OUTBREAK TOOK PLACE:--- SIGNIFICANT SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OCCURRED, IT WASN'T EASY TO STOP, THERE WERE--- NO VIRUS PROTECTION PACKAGES, AND PEOPLE DIDN'T TAKE THE THREAT SERIOUSLY.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [MORGAN.GIF-----------------] MORGAN WATKINS AND FANTOM, HIS GUIDE DOG----------------------------------------------------------------------------- TODAY, WE HAVE CAMPUS LICENSES FOR ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE THOUSANDS--- OF COMPUTER VIRUSES SKULKING WORLDWIDE. UNFORTUNATELY, PEOPLE STILL DON'T TAKE--- THE THREAT SERIOUSLY ENOUGHAND THE STAKES ARE MUCH HIGHER. WITH MILLIONS OF--- BUSINESS-CRITICAL COMPUTERS LINKED TO THE INTERNET, A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT--- VIRUS COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN A SINGLE ELECTRONIC BLITZKRIEG.---- THE LATEST MAJOR ATTACK CAME ON MAY 5, WHEN THE----- "LOVE BUG-----" INFECTED--- MICROSOFT OUTLOOK MAIL SERVICES AND MAILBOXES ACROSS THE WORLD. THOUSANDS OF--- INFECTED E-MAIL MESSAGES WERE GENERATED ON CAMPUS, SPREADING A POTENTIAL DISASTER--- THROUGHOUT THE UT COMMUNITY.---- ALTHOUGH ASIA AND EUROPE HAD ALREADY BEEN STRUCK BY THE LOVE BUG DURING THE--- NIGHT, THERE WERE NO OFFICIAL ALERTS TO WARN AMERICANS. EVEN SO, ACITS AND MANY--- DEPARTMENTAL COMPUTER ADMINISTRATORS REACTED IMMEDIATELY. WITHIN MINUTES, ACITS--- PERSONNEL WERE PHONING ADMINISTRATIVE AND DEPARTMENTAL CONTACTS ACROSS CAMPUS,--- LETTING THEM KNOW OF THE ATTACK. SINCE E-MAIL MIGHT BE SEEN ONLY AFTER IT WAS--- TOO LATE, OTHER STAFF POSTED SIGNS IN BUILDINGS AND KNOCKED ON OFFICE DOORS.--- SOME DEPARTMENTS SHUT DOWN THEIR SERVERS; OTHERS ISOLATED THEIR LOCAL NETWORKS;--- OTHERS BRAVED OUT THE ATTACK BUT CAREFULLY REVIEWED THEIR E-MAIL AND REFUSED--- TO OPEN ANY ATTACHMENTS. THROUGHOUT THE BLITZ, ACITS' CENTRAL SERVICES REMAINED--- AVAILABLE WHILE TECHNICAL STAFF WERE BUSY STOPPING THE INFLUX OF CONTAMINATED--- ATTACHMENTS. THE HELP DESK WAS ON HAND TO ASSIST, AND UT'S HOME PAGE POSTED--- A PROMINENT ALERT, DIRECTING PEOPLE TO USEFUL INFORMATION. SHORTLY AFTER NOON,--- SEMINARS WERE GIVEN ON HOW TO ERADICATE THE LOVE BUG. A SPECIAL TEAM REMAINED--- ON CAMPUS UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT TO HELP ANYONE WHO NEEDED HANDS-ON ASSISTANCE.--- CAMPUS-WIDE RECOVERY EFFORTS WENT WELL. IN PART IT WAS THE SKILLS-OF DEDICATED--- STAFF ACROSS CAMPUS; IN PART IT WAS LUCK.---- FORTUNATELY, THE-LOVE BUG WAS RATHER INNOCUOUS, ITS-DESTRUCTIVE POWER MOSTLY----LIMITED TO-THROWING AWAY MULTIMEDIA FILES AND LEAVING DROPPINGS THROUGHOUT SYSTEM--- FOLDERS. IT DID NOT TRASH HARD DISKS, AND IT WAS RELATIVELY EASY TO RECOGNIZE. ---THE LOVE BUG WAS NOT A TERRORIST ACT. BUT THE NEXT STRIKE COULD WELL BE.--------------------------- FOR IT MANAGERS: BE PREPARED---------------- WE HOPE THAT COMPUTER USERS ARE FINALLY AWARE OF HOW VULNERABLE THEIR ELECTRONIC--- ASSETS REALLY ARE. IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, A-POORLY DESIGNED AND SIMPLE PIECE--- OF CODE CAUSED -20 BILLION-IN DAMAGES.-WE-MUST ASSUME-THAT VIRUS-CREATORS ARE--- ALSO AWARE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER NOW AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. TO PROTECT THE--- UNIVERSITY, WE NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION, ORGANIZATION, AND PREPARATION. THE--- COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS BELOW ARE DIRECTED TO-IT MANAGERS ON CAMPUS.---- EVEN CAREFUL PLANNING WON'T GIVE PERFECT SECURITY AGAINST ATTACKSTHERE WILL--- ALWAYS BE HOLES IN OUR DEFENSES. THE KEY-TO SURVIVING AN ELECTRONIC INCURSION--- IS TO EXPECT IT. THIS INCLUDES PLANNING AHEAD, REACTING QUICKLY, NOTIFYING THE--- RIGHT PEOPLE, FINDING-SOLUTIONS,-AND CLEANING UP THE MESS. AFTERWARDS, A POST-MORTEM--- SHOULD BE DONE-TO LEARN HOW TO REACT BETTER THE NEXT TIME.-----GENERALLY,-YOUR MOST PRECIOUS COMPUTER ASSET IS YOUR DATA, AND ANYTHING YOU--- CAN DO BEFORE-HAND TO PROTECT IT COULD SAVE YOU LATER.-KEEP YOUR COMPUTERS'--- OPERATING SYSTEMS AND ANTIVIRUS SOLUTIONS UP-TO-DATE, AND, ABOVE ALL, HAVE RELIABLE,--- DAILY BACKUPS USING EXPERTLY MANAGED SERVERS. MAKING USERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SYSTEM--- UPDATES AND BACKUPS IS A POOR SOLUTION. KEEPING DATA ON SERVERS MAKES IT EASIER--- TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM BACKUPS.--------------------------- HAVE A PLAN . . . ----------------KNOW THE LOCATION OF ALL YOUR-DEPARTMENTAL COMPUTING RESOURCES. IF THE DEPARTMENT--- HAS DESKTOP MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES, THAT IS, SPECIFIC HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEMS,--- AND APPLICATION SUITES THAT ALL MEMBERS OF A PARTICULAR GROUP USE, IT IS MUCH--- EASIER TO RECOVER FROM A DISASTER. IF USER DATA IS STORED ON FILE-SERVERS AND--- IF STANDARD SYSTEM-IMAGES ARE-MAINTAINED, THE-ROAD TO NORMAL OPERATIONS IS SHORTER.--- AND-THIS IS TRUE WHETHER THE INCIDENT IS A VIRUS ATTACK, A FIRE, FLOOD, OR THEFT.---- IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY INCIDENT, SUCH AS A DESTRUCTIVE VIRUS, REACTION--- TIME IS CRUCIAL. BEFORE IT HAPPENS, ORGANIZE AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM (ERT).--- YOU'LL NEED AN INCIDENT RESPONSE COORDINATOR (IRC), A COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR--- (CC), AND AN INCIDENT TECHNICAL LEADER (ITL). DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR--- ORGANIZATION, YOU MAY NEED OTHERS TO-HELP MAKE SURE ALL THE WORK-GETS DONE. ---THE IRC COORDINATES THE-ACTIONS OF THE TEAM AND TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISIONS.--- THE CC SPREADS THE WORD AND BECOMES THE SOLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE PRESS.--- THE ITL GATHERS NECESSARY TECHNICAL INFORMATION, PUTS TOGETHER SOLUTIONS, AND--- MAKES SURE THAT THE PROBLEM IS CLEANED UP. FINALLY, MEMBERS OF THE ERT MUST--- BE TRAINED AND MUST HAVE MATERIALS TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS.--------------------------- GET IN TOUCH . . .---------------- AN ERT REQUIRES A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN. WHO NEEDS TO BE CONTACTED IF A VIRUS--- OR OTHER ATTACK IS DETECTED? THE PLAN SHOULD-HAVE NAMES, PHONE NUMBERS, AND--- THE REASON-FOR CALLING EACH PERSON OR UNIT.-THERE WILL-BE NO TIME TO WORK THROUGH--- THE TELEPHONE BOOK TRYING TO HUNT DOWN PHONE NUMBERS. BE SURE ACITS IS ON THE--- LIST. WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION WITH DEPARTMENTS AND USERS AND HELP ASSESS THE--- EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE. ALSO, A CURRENT PAPER INVENTORY LISTING OF HARDWARE AND--- SOFTWARE ASSETS, STORED IN A PREARRANGED, SECURE LOCATION, COULD BE ESSENTIAL--- DURING A SEVERE ATTACK.---- AN ERT CHECKLIST OF STEPS TO BE TAKEN AND A SET OF FORMS-TO DOCUMENT WORK IS--- ALSO ESSENTIAL. ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF AN ERT MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN A----PROBLEM HAPPENS, AND SOMEONE ELSE MAY NEED TO FILL THE ROLE. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH--- AS PREPRINTED INSTRUCTIONS AND SIGNS FOR HALLWAYS SHOULD ALSO BE CREATED AND--- STORED. PERIODIC DISASTER DRILLS WILL KEEP THE PROCEDURES FRESH. AN ERT IS OF--- LITTLE USE IF ITS MEMBERS CANNOT BE FOUND. DEPARTMENTS SHOULD HAVE EMERGENCY--- PROCEDURES POSTED IN A CENTRAL LOCATION TO MAKE IT EASY TO FIND RESPONSIBLE--- PARTIES AT ANY TIME. EVEN IF SOMEONE HAS AGREED TO WEAR A PAGER, THERE SHOULD--- BE ALTERNATE CONTACTS.--------------------------- DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM . . .---------------- DON'T TRY TO DIAGNOSE A SECURITY INCIDENT ALONE. GATHER WHAT INFORMATION YOU--- CAN, BUT CHECK WITH THE HELP DESK AND OTHER SUPPORT SITES, AS WELL AS WITHIN--- YOUR COLLEGE, TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS. IF THE INTERNET IS STILL ---ACCESSIBLE,-CHECK THE UT HOME PAGE TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN POSTED. OTHER--- EXCELLENT SITES THAT TRACK THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS INCLUDE:---- THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE-------------------- PROTECTION CENTER:---------------------------------- WWW.NIPC.GOV---------------- THE SANS INSTITUTE:---------------------------------- WWW.SANS.ORG---------------- THE CERT COORDINATION CENTER:--------------------------------- WWW.CERT.ORG--------------------------------- ALSO, CHECK PRIVATE VENDORS, SUCH AS-------------------- NETWORK ASSOCIATES:--------------------------------- WWW.NAI.COM---------------- SYMANTEC:-------------------------------------- WWW.SYMANTEC.COM---------------- DATA FELLOWS:----------------------------------------- WWW.DATAFELLOWS.COM--------------------------------- IT MAY BE PRUDENT TO DISCONNECT AN AFFECTED MACHINE FROM THE CAMPUS NETWORK,--- BUT DON'T TURN IT OFF UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FACING. SOME VIRUSES CAUSE--- FURTHER DAMAGE DURING THE BOOT PROCESS. OBVIOUSLY, BE CAREFUL NOT TO TRIGGER--- A VIRUS ON A SYSTEM CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK OR ONE-THAT HAS USEFUL INFORMATION--- ON ITS HARD DRIVE. SOME VIRUSES CAN DISRUPT FIRMWARE SEVERELY ENOUGH TO MAKE--- A SYSTEM NEARLY UNRECOVERABLE. MOREOVER, AVOID READING E-MAIL WHILE LOGGED IN--- WITH A PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT ON A WORKSTATION OR SERVER. CONCEIVABLY, YOU COULD--- TAKE DOWN AN ENTIRE FACILITY BY DOING SO. FINALLY, WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE--- FOUND, SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH ACITS SO THAT A GENERAL ALERT CAN BE SOUNDED.--------------------------- NOTIFY, ISOLATE, AND PROTECT . . .---------------- GETTING THE WORD OUT TO YOUR USER COMMUNITY-CAN BE A PROBLEM DURING A CYBER--- ATTACK. SOMETIMES, SENDING INFORMATION BY E-MAIL IS ILL-ADVISED, AND TELEPHONE--- CONTACT ALLOWS FOR IMMEDIATE INTERCHANGE. IF PEOPLE CAN'T BE REACHED BY PHONE,--- KNOCK ON DOORS AND-POST SIGNS-IN HALLWAYS AND ON OFFICE DOORS. THE KEY IS TO--- USE ALL COMMUNICATIONS-PATHS, DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE INCIDENT.---- IF AN ATTACK IS STILL UNDERWAY, IT MAY BE PRUDENT TO DISCONNECT YOUR SERVERS--- FROM THE NETWORK, AND THEN TO DISCONNECT COMPROMISED SYSTEMS. KEEP TRACK OF--- WHAT MACHINES HAVE PROBLEMS-AND MARK THEM IN SOME WAY SO THAT OTHERS WILL KNOW--- THE MACHINE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY RESTORED. PAPER SIGNS TAPED OVER THE MONITOR--- SCREENS ARE OBVIOUS INDICATORS AND WILL-NOT FALL OFF OR BE IGNORED. AFFECTED--- MACHINES SHOULD NOT BE USED UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WORKING TOGETHER--------------- ACITS IS ORGANIZING A SERIES OF SYMPOSIUMS TO HELP DEPARTMENTS AND COLLEGES--------- COORDINATE THEIR RESPONSES TO CYBER ATTACKS. TO BE KEPT UP-TO-DATE ON--------- THIS, SUBSCRIBE TO THE UT TECHNICAL SUPPORT MAILING LIST BY SENDING TO------------ LISTPROC-LISTS.CC.UTEXAS.EDU---- THE ONE-LINE--------- MESSAGE----------------------------------- SUBSCRIBE VTECHSUPPORT---------------------- FIRSTNAME LASTNAME------------------------------------- TO LEARN HOW ACITS CAN DIRECTLY HELP YOU PLAN FOR, AND REACT TO, THESE----------KINDS OF EMERGENCIES, OR IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT HOW ACITS CAN HELP YOU--------- MANAGE YOUR CURRENT RESOURCES, CALL MORGAN WATKINS AT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------ASSESS DAMAGE AND RESEARCH SOLUTIONS . . .---------------- ONCE YOU KNOW THE-SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM, YOU'LL NEED TO BEGIN PLANNING YOUR--- RECOVERY. SYSTEMS THAT AFFECT SEVERAL USERS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEED A HIGHER--- PRIORITY. MOBILIZE YOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM-TO HANDLE THINGS METHODICALLY.--- THE INCIDENT TECHNICAL LEADER WILL NEED TO WATCH DEVELOPMENTS AND TALK WITH--- OTHERS FACING THE SAME PROBLEM. REACTING-TOO QUICKLY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS--- WORSE OR COMPLICATE RECOVERY. DURING THE LOVE BUG INCIDENT, SEVERAL DIFFERENT--- WAYS TO ERADICATE THE VIRUS WERE POSTED AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM--- WERE EFFECTIVE. EVEN THE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS FROM VENDORS OFFERED LESS-THAN-PERFECT--- SOLUTIONS.--------------------------- CLEAN UP AND DO A POST-MORTEM . .-.------------ KEEP AFFECTED SYSTEMS OFFLINE UNTIL YOU HAVE REMOVED ANY COMPROMISED ELEMENTS- AND CAN VERIFY THAT THE SYSTEM HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL. YOU MAY NEED TO DO FRESH- INSTALLS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM AND RESTORE FILES FROM BACKUP TAPES. AFTER THAT,- YOUR FINAL TASK IS TO CHANGE ALL OF YOUR PASSWORDS AND ADVISE YOUR NETWORK USERS- TO CHANGE THEIR PASSWORDS.---- CAREFULLY REVIEW EVERYTHING DONE DURING AN INCIDENT, SHORTLY AFTER-ITS RESOLUTION.--- MANY LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED BY STUDYING THE WAY THAT THINGS WERE HANDLED. WATCH--- FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM ACITS OF A GENERAL POST-MORTEM SO THAT OTHERS CAN LEARN--- FROM DIFFERENT APPROACHES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
