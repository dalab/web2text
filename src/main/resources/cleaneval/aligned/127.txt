Change the Media. Become the Media. Reclaim the Media: Come to the
Bellingham Grassroots & Independent Media Conference.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□On March 24th, veteran TV talkshow host, Phil Donahue, now banished
from MSNBC for airing the views of millions of Americans who opposed
the Iraq invasion, told Democracy Now□s Amy Goodman: □We have an
emergency in the media, and we have to fix it.□ This sentiment
resonates with the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans
and citizens around the world who are standing up to challenge the
growing power of the giant media corporations. Everyday these
corporations shirk more of the public interest, slash more of their
news budgets, and fail to deliver information vital to the health of
our communities and our democracy.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□The movement to challenge these giant corporations is much more than a
media reform movement, it is a grassroots media production movement: a
movement of  independent journalists, radio producers, filmmakers, and
online community builders, a movement of storytellers constantly
seeking better ways to make and distribute the stories the big
corporations can□t or won□t produce for our communities. This is a
movement for everyone that likes a good story, that wants to tell one
or hear one, whether they□re a veteran media-maker or someone whose
only just thought of picking up a camera or imagined seeing their
story in print. This is a movement that believes the more we
democratize the media by growing the pool of storytellers and
distributing their stories, the better off our communities, and our
democracy will be.□□□□□□On Saturday May 21st you□re invited to the Bellingham Grassroots and
Independent Media Conference running 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Garden
St. Family Center (1231 N. Garden) in Bellingham, WA. The conference
website is www.whatcompjc.org/media conf.. This conference is a new
project of  the Whatcom Peace & Justice Center.□□□□□□The conference is being held to celebrate the growing local and
regional culture of media production, to build awareness of innovative
community radio, video, and web-based media projects, and to mobilize
support for grassroots powered media reform. We also seek to
understand how the independent media movement can more effectively
challenge the assumptions perpetuated in the mass media that justify
war and social injustice.□□□□□□□□□□□□
Keynote speaker Patrick Reinsborough, of the smartMeme project, will
kick off the conference at 9 a.m. speaking on:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Winning the Battle of
the Story: Creating a Culture of Change.□□□□□□□□ Patrick is dynamic a
grassroots organizer, campaigner, and media strategist who spent four
year as the organizing director of the Rainforest Action Network where
he mobilized thousands of people to confront corporations who destroy
the environment and violate human rights. The smartMeme project is a
collective of organizers, trainers and media activists, who help
grassroots groups magnify their impact by linking traditional movement
building skills with cutting edge media campaigning.□□□□□□Keynote Speaker Bert Sacks will speak on □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Sanctions, War, Occupation,
and other Failures of the Media.□□□□□□□□ Bert Sacks has traveled to Iraq nine
times since 1996 with Voices in the Wilderness and Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility, and has extensive experience
lobbying the media for greater and more accurate coverage of the
situation in Iraq and the Middle East.□□□□□□The conference will feature numerous workshops, skills trainings, and
panel discussions by local media makers and media activists from
throughout the region. These include a workshop by John Sinno of Arab
Film Distribution on the demonizing and stereotyping of Arabs in the
media and popular culture, panel discussions on the indymedia
movement, community radio, documentary film & video, public access TV,
online community media projects, reports from the National Conference
on Media Reform, and more.

Tip Credit is Tip Theft! Rep. Kelli Linville wants to pass bill to legalize

Wage and Benefit Protection and Enhancement Act (The version in the
Senate is SB 5774). The title is totally misleading. At a meeting with
local Dems Saturday she basically refused to say why she supported it.
If passed this bill will effectively destroy a whole sector of living
wage jobs in this state!□□□□□□□□□□□□What the bills do:□□□□□□□□□□□□Restaurant owners are pursuing legislation in Olympia that would cut
tipped employees minimum wage from $7.35 per hour to a base wage of
$3.68 per hour.
□□□□□□□□□□□□Instead of □protecting□ or □enhancing□ workers wages and benefits this
legislation would basically cut all tipped employees minimum wages to
$3.68 instead of the current state minimum wage of $7.35. Restaurant
Employers would be required to make up the difference only if tips did
not. So if a server was receiving the minimum wage whatever a server
made between $7.35 and $11.03 every hour would go into the employers
pocket. That□s is basically a wage cut of $3.68 per hour, nearly $30
in an 8 hr. day, and nearly $150 a week. That□s taking a living wage
job and turning it into a poverty level job.□□□□□□□□□□□□Plus, how long would an employee who didn't make an average of $3.70
an hour in tips last before their boss fired them?
□□□□□□□□□□□□Another thing about this legislation is that it only applies to new
hires.  This is a shameless dirty trick to make restaurant employees
relax into thinking this won't effect them.□□□□□□□□□□□□Please call the legislative hotline at 1-800-562-6000 to tell your
represatatives: Tip Credit?

understand that some amendments have been made in the Senate version
SB 5285 (house version is HB 1357) which would facilitate the
privatization of municipal water provision in Washington.□□□□□□SB 5285 did escape from committee.□□□□□□□□□□□□Rep. Kelli Linville vowed to kill the house bill in her committee
Saturday at a meeting in Bellingham:□□□□□□□□□□□□According to the Cascade Sierra Club□s website:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Provisions that would have allowed private ownership of public
water systems were removed. Now, the bill provides a process for
local governments to contract with private companies to design,
build, and operate public water systems. Other improvements include
limits on the length of the contracts, and language that ensure
water rights don't transfer from the local government to the
private company.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□However I feel that the bill is still deeply flawed and should be
scrapped altogether. The bill still halves from 60 to 30 days the
requirement for public notice. The bill still deletes the existing
requirement obligating service providers to demonstrate that a local
government□s annual costs will be lower under its proposal than they
would be if the local government itself financed, constructed, owned,
operated, and maintained facilities. Instead local official will
merely determine that privatization of services is in the □public interest.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□There is no reason to cut the time for public process in half. There
is no reason not to require service providers to demonstrate the
financial benefits of privatization. According to Hugh Jackson of
Public Citizen even the Federal government requires the potential
service providers demonstrate a 10% savings before services are
privatized.□□□□□□□□□□□□Apparently some local elected officials such as those in Sunnyside,
Washington are so ready to privatize their services do not even want
to know if privatization is a cheaper alternative. Rep. Linville says
the City of Bellingham sent her the bill.□□□□□□□□□□□□I think our elected officials in Olympia have an obligation to protect
Washington residents from being gouged by private water companies and
from having their municipalities budget□s raided by these same
companies no matter where they live and no matter how irresponsible
their local elected officials wish to be.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□// posted by Nate Johnson□□□□□□@□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□10:46 AM□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□0 comments□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□   □□□□Saturday, February 19, 2005□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Why are Sen. Adam Kline and Rep. Kelli Linville backing Big Water?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□While in Olympia for environmental lobby day Thursday I found out
about Senate Bill 5285 and House Bill 1357. These bills would make it
easier to privatize municipal water provision in Washington state. I
have since found out that Sen. Adam Kline and Rep. Kelli Linville
among other democrats are supporting these bills which are updates of
1986 legislation. I am currently attempting to find out their reasons
for supporting these bills.
□□□□□□□□□□□□Among other things these bills delete the existing requirement
obligating service providers to demonstrate that a local governments
annual costs will be lower under its proposal than they would be if
the local government itself financed, constructed, owned, operated,
and maintained facilities and instead requires that municipalities
merely find privatization in the "public interest."□□□□□□□□□□□□There is no reason not to require service providers to demonstrate the
financial benefits of privatization. Replacing this standard with a
finding of "public interest" could never be in the public interest.□□□□□□□□□□□□Publically operated water systems are managed to deliver, clean, safe,
and affordable water. Privately operated systems are managed to get as
much money as possible from rate payers.□□□□□□□□□□□□Water privatization will likely lead to substantially increased rates,
and degraded water quality throughout Washington state.□□□□□□□□□□□□According to Public Citizen, the Veolia corporation, the world's
largest water services corporation, which is lobbying for this
legislation, has "a global track record of corruption, broken
promises, environmental degradation, price gouging, obsfuscation,
misdirection and secrecy."□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□// posted by Nate Johnson□□□□□□@□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□4:08 PM□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□0 comments□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□   □□□□Monday, February 14, 2005□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

February 11th appears to lack basis in fact. In the feature Ms.
Kendrick interviews a local financial consultant on the subject of
what people will need to know when they get a chance to manage their
money  under President Bush's plan to divert money from social security
into private accounts.
□□□□□□□□□□□□Where is the evidence people will get to manage their own money under
the Bush plan? Is Ms. Kendrick's report based solely on the President
Bush's remarks in the State of the Union address? President Bush has
not released a detailed plan and as of Tuesday, February 8th the White
House said they had no plans to: see this story for details□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Given this lack of a plan all reporting about so-called personal
accounts is based on supposition. Without acknowledging this fact Ms.
Kendrick's story both assumes  and helps spread the misinformation that
people will have a chance to make their own decisions over what to do
with the money from their "personal accounts". There is no evidence
that the so-called "personal accounts" will have any resemblance to
what is generally considered personal ownership. Ms. Kendrick's
feature blithely ignores this fact.
□□□□□□□□□□□□MSNBC's Martin Wolk on February 4th reported□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
wrote that:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□"President Bush frequently argues that one of the big advantages of
his proposed personal retirement accounts is that unlike
traditional Social Security they would allow participants to leave
any accumulated wealth to their □children or grandchildren.□□□□□□□□□□□□□"But that is not completely true under the proposal that has been
advanced by White House officials, which would require many workers
to convert some or all of their savings into annuities that would
expire at death."□□□□□□□□□□□□and that: "According to a senior administration official who
briefed reporters on the still-sketchy proposal this week, many
workers who elect to participate in the personal account program
would be required at retirement age to purchase an annuity to
ensure they have a minimal stream of annual income for the rest of
their life."□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Mr Wolk minces word by saying that the assumptions promoted the
President and repeated by Ms. Kendricks are "not completely true."
They are intentionally misleading. To be blunt they are lies promoted
by the White House to help sell their plan. There are many ways to
approach this story and many ways to distort it. I encourage KPLU and
Ms. Kendricks to investigate these issue more thorougly before
reporting. Some resources for these investigations could include:

is strength, Bush wants to save social security.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Bush: Save Social Security□ was the post State of  the Union
headline in the Feb 4th Bellingham Herald. This headline no doubt
produced a state of confusion in many who read it. In what sense
does President Bush want to □save social security□? Perhaps only in
the sense of that officer in Vietnam who said: □We had to destroy
the village in order save it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□So why is the major media working so hard for Mr. Bush? It□s a good
question, and maybe the question. Democrats have been doing a good
job of holding their elected officials accountable, but it□s time
to start working on the press. The battle to save social security
has in many ways already been won in Washington, D.C. but if we do
nothing it may be lost in newsrooms around the country. Here□s
another key question: When the President tells a lie is it the duty
of the press to repeat the lie verbatim? Or is it the duty of the
press to call the President out for lying? When we fail to answer
this question correctly we go to war on false pretenses, gut key
social programs, and bankrupt the nation.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□In 1946 George Orwell published his famous essay □Politics and the
English Language□ in which he wrote: □A man may take to drink
because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the
more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that
is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and
inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness
of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.□
The times being what they are we cannot afford foolish thoughts or
a slovenly media which fails to hold the powerful accountable to
the truth.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Diverting money from the social security trust fund into private
accounts will not save and strengthen social security, it will only
weaken and defund it. According to the Center for Economic and
Policy Research nearly 2/3rds of elderly households get more than
half their income from social security and nearly half of the
elderly would fall below the poverty line without it. Additionally,
more than 6 million workers receive disability benefits through the
Social Security trust fund, as do 1.6 million children. These
people have been effectively disappeared from the national debate.
As Senator Patty Murray states: □While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security □ from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.□ To help save

of the Great Depression, one of our nation's greatest leaders □
Franklin Delano Roosevelt □ set out to create a program to provide
peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During
his crusade to create the program, FDR said, "There is no tragedy
in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means
of support."□□□□□□□□□□□□The program he created is to this day the single greatest social
insurance program in our nation's history. Social Security, as it
would be called, has been a resounding success by keeping millions
of people out of poverty.□□□□□□□□□□□□Just months before the new program was enacted, FDR laid out his
vision of how this most important program should be implemented.□□□□□□□□□□□□He said: "We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population
against one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of
life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure
of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the
loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too,
represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but
is by no means complete.... It is...a law that will take care of
human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an
economic structure of vastly greater soundness." Those were the
words of FDR in August, 1935□□□□□□□□□□□□But today, this cornerstone, this basic American value, is now
under attack.□□□□□□□□□□□□President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social
Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically
restructured. But I rise today to reaffirm the values and spirit
FDR laid out 70 years ago.□□□□□□□□□□□□Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of
retiring minds at ease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed
benefit that all Americans can count on.□□□□□□□□□□□□It's a promise that if you work hard, you'll have some security
when you retire or if you become disabled. It's a promise that
seniors won't have to live in poverty. And it's a promise that if
your spouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and
security you need.□□□□□□□□□□□□And of course the program is about more than security -- it's about
community. In America, we believe that it's important to take care
of the generation that came before. It's important to guarantee
them a quality of life. And it's important that we guarantee
benefits after a lifetime of hard work.□□□□□□□□□□□□But I'm very concerned that President Bush's "restructuring" will
imperil the security of all Americans □ from young workers retiring
in decades to seniors retiring today. The problem with his plan is
that:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
It's the end of guaranteed benefits.□□□□□□□□□□□
It does nothing to fix the long-term issues the system faces.□□□□□□□□□□□
It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt.□□□□□□□□□□□
It's dangerous.□□□□□□□□□□□□We cannot, and will not, let President Bush tear apart Social
Security.□□□□□□□□□□□□While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security □ from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.□□□□□□□□□□□□Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them, and
if I see something that's going to hurt our workers, our families,
and our seniors, I'm going to fight it with everything I've got.□□□□□□□□□□□□Any discussion about Social Security must meet certain criteria if
it means to be productive. You could call it a test □ and any
proposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from
this body.□□□□□□□□□□□□We must:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit□□□□□□□□□□□
Preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are
disabled□□□□□□□□□□□
Protect against benefit reductions for women, minorities and all
others□□□□□□□□□□□
Protect our budget from ever growing deficits□□□□□□□□□□□□Anything short of this would be an unnecessary, dangerous gamble
unworthy of this important insurance program.□□□□□□□□□□□□While we□re just beginning this discussion, my female colleagues
and I have worked for years to ensure some basic principles are
followed as we move forward. The promise of Social Security is
especially important to women because women face unique challenges
in retirement. We know that women make less money than men, women
leave the workforce to raise families, women live longer, and women
are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition.□□□□□□□□□□□□Even with those special challenges, Social Security keeps millions
of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are tilted to
give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and
minorities. If the President privatizes Social Security, he would
destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners need in their
retirement years.□□□□□□□□□□□□We also know that Social Security isn't just a retirement program.
As I've said, it protects disabled workers and their families. If
Social Security is privatized, what happens to a worker who is
disabled and can't contribute to her account? Today, under Social
Security, that worker is protected. But there's no guarantee under
the Bush plan.□□□□□□□□□□□□President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older
women depend on. This is one reform that would have disastrous
results, and I know we will not stand for it.□□□□□□□□□□□□Under this Administration, many things we take for granted from
overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been
threatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security.
I am here today to say that some things are just too important to
American families. Providing real security to all Americans is a
basic value worth protecting. We will make sure that President Bush
doesn't gamble that security and break the promise Social Security
keeps for millions of women and their families.

or writing to their representatives and senators only to hear that
they can't make any public comment because the president hasn't
released his plan yet.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□"The staffer I talked to this afternoon in Senator [blank]'s
office," says one reader, "told me that they had been waiting to go
public because they didn't have a concrete proposal to respond to."
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Please. □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□This sort of mumbojumbo might have some logic from a Republican up
for reelection next year who's trying to be as cautious as
possible. But why would any Democrat -- like the recently-reelected
senator from the Northwest whose office the reader contacted -- be
saying something so foolish? The White House has its own reasons
for pretending they haven't decided on a specific plan yet. But why
do the president's opponents have to pretend that that's really
true?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Everybody in the country who's paying any attention to this debate
knows the essence of the president's plan -- he wants to replace a
portion of Social Security with private investment accounts. How he
fudges the numbers on the cost side or deals with benefit cuts
remains a bit muddled. But the fundamental point is as clear as
day.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□So why should any senator or representative be waiting one minute
to make their position clear, unless he or she is seriously
entertaining the idea of voting for the president's plan?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□How many details of an upper-income-earner tax hike do most
Republicans need to see before they're willing to say they oppose
it?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Yeah, that's my sense too.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□To be cagey like this is not only a disservice, □□□even a dishonesty□□□□,
to constituents, it's also the height of foolishness for any
lawmaker who really cares about preserving Social Security and not
letting the president end the program.

cares alot about what's been going on in Iraq) this is a way, way
bigger deal. In particular thanks for highlighting Adam Smith's views,
he can be a real pain on a lot of issues and our congressman, Rick
Larsen, in the 2nd district tends to follow him around by the nose.
(Larsen's opposed-all his staffer's been told to say-as of this
afternoon).□□□□□□I think now that things are starting to fall out we really need to
push people to get their Senators and Representatives who are with us
on this one to go public. Because if they don't there's nothing to
counter the rights big media buys. The staffer I talked to this
afternoon in Senator Murray's office told me that they had been
waiting to go public because they didn't have a concrete proposal to
respond to! WTF! Is Karl Rove supplying their office with all the
Kool-Aid they can drink? Murray should be hitting this hard, she just
got re-elected by a wide margin, she could be providing Sen. Cantwell
with some cover on this.□□□□□□Maria Cantwell, also still opposed to private accounts, may be excused
a bit by the fact that she is up for reelection soon, but she still is
working to make the Enron scandal one of her signature issues. If your
going to shoulder the banner of economic populism this is hardly the
time or place to leave the field.□□□□□□I've attached an article/press releases from our local paper about
congressional prioriaties that doesn't mention SS once.□□□□□□□□□□□□Thanks,□□□□□□□□□□□□Nate Johnson□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□// posted by Nate Johnson□□□□□□@□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□6:49 PM□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□0 comments□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□   □□□□Sunday, January 16, 2005□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□

this state on Social Security.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Dear Editor,□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Both Washington State□s Senators and many of our state□s Representatives are telling their constituents they oppose the President□s plan to divert money from the Social Security trust
fund into private accounts. But with the notable exception of□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Rep.
Adam Smith who has told the New Republic he categorically opposes
private accounts, the rest of our congressional delegation is
studiously ignoring the issue in public.

oppose private accounts they□ve been waiting to see the substance
of the President□s proposal. Their waiting for what?! That□s
exactly what Karl Rove wants them to do. At least Armstrong
Williams is getting paid to follow the Bush administration□s script.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Instead of sitting on their hands our Senators and Representatives
need to be doing everything in their power to protect Social
Security from the imminent Republican attempt to privatize and
ultimately destroy the most successful anti-poverty program in our
nation□s history. It□s not as if this planned assault doesn□t
affect anyone. More than 890,000 Washington state residents are
current Social Security beneficiaries. Senator Murray, in
particular, who easily won re-election, has no excuse for remaining
silent. If you want to save Social Security as we know it, please
contact our Senators and Representatives and tell them it□s not enough to just tell their constituents they oppose the President□s
plan for private accounts. Tell them, it□s time to go public, to
stand up and be counted.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□N.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□//
