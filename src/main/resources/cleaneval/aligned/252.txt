THIS IS NOT ABOUT ENCOURAGING PROMISCUITY, BUT SAYING TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY SEXUALLY ACTIVE: SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM IS SERIOUSLY RISKY, SO ALWAYS USE ONE.--------------X------ WHILE MOST SEXUAL HEALTH GROUPS HAVE WELCOMED THE LONG-OVERDUE CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE SAID IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH.------ THE ORIGINAL BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAMME ANNOUNCED BACK IN 2003 WASX-------50 MILLION.------ THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN HAS COST JUSTX-------4 MILLION, LEAVING A POTENTIALX-------46 MILLION STILL TO BE SPENT.-------------- CAROLINE FLINT HAS SAID THAT THEX-------50 MILLION TOTAL IS MEANT TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS.------ IT IS HOWEVER THREE YEARS SINCE THE CAMPAIGN WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO PROMISES MADE THAT THE REST OF THE ALLOTTED CASH WILL BE USED AT ANY POINT IN THE FUTURE.-------------- PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN RESTRICTED IN ITS SCOPE IS THE FACT THAT BRITAIN-------S SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE SIMPLY NOT IN A FIT STATE TO ACCEPT THE HUGE INFLUX OF EXTRA PATIENTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO SEEK SCREENING AS A RESULT OF MORE WIDESPREAD ADVERTISEMENTS.----- X-------300 MILLION WAS PROMISED TO IMPROVE AND MODERNISE GENITOURINARY MEDICINE (GUM) SERVICES BACK IN 2003, BUT BECAUSE THE CASH WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR SEXUAL HEALTH, MANY NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE PRIMARY CARE TRUSTS HAVE USED THE MONEY TO DIG THEMSELVES OUT OF DEBT INSTEAD.------ MOST GUM CLINICS THEREFORE REMAIN UNDERSTAFFED AND OVERSTRETCHED, WITH PATIENTS LUCKY TO BE SEEN IN TWO WEEKS RATHER THAN THE TWO DAYS RECOMMENDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.-------------- ANOTHER REASON FOR THE RESTRICTION MAY BE THAT FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SQUEAMISH ABOUT DISCUSSING SEXUAL HEALTH ON TELEVISION BEFORE THE 9 O-------CLOCK WATERSHED, WHEN YOUNGER VIEWERS MAY BE WATCHING.------ AIMING THE CAMPAIGN AT18 X------- 24 YEAR OLDS OVERCOMES THIS PROBLEM.------ HOWEVER, WHILE SOME STIS, SUCH AS CHLAMYDIA, ARE STATISTICALLY MOST COMMON IN THIS AGE GROUP, STIS DO ALSO AFFECT YOUNGER (AND OLDER) PEOPLE IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, AND THERE IS A DANGER THAT USING VERY AGE-SPECIFIC CAMPAIGNS COULD LEAD OTHER GROUPS TO BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT AT RISK.-------------- A SURVEY RELEASED THIS WEEK FOR EXAMPLE HAS SHOWN THAT MANY TEENS ARE HAVING SEX FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE THE LEGAL AGE OF SIXTEEN, WITH GIRLS TWICE AS-LIKELY AS BOYS TO LOSE THEIR VIRGINITY BEFORE THIS AGE.------ WHILE THE GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE SOME ONLINE AND PRINT CAMPAIGNS AIMED AT YOUNGER TEENAGERS, THESE ARE VERY LOW KEY, AND THEIR REACH AND IMPACT HAS NEVER BEEN OFFICIALLY ASSESSED.------ ENCOURAGING CONDOM USE MAY WELL BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUNGER TEENS, BUT THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE OLDER TO HAVE SEX, AND INDEED MANY MAY NOT RECOGNISE IT AS AN OPTION.------ SEX AND RELATIONSHIPS EDUCATION REMAINS NON-COMPULSORY IN SCHOOLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF BASIC SCIENCE LESSONS.-------------- WITH 95,000 PEOPLE RECEIVING DIAGNOSES OF CHLAMYDIA LAST YEAR, AND 58,000 PEOPLE NOW LIVING WITH HIV IN THE UK, SEXUAL HEALTH HAS TO BE MADE A FAR BIGGER PRIORITY.------ THE TOMBSTONE ADVERTISEMENTS OF THE 1980S MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLY-DRAMATIC BY TODAY-------S STANDARDS, BUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE TARGETED AT EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY MEANT THAT AIDS BECAME AN ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE THAT FEW PEOPLE WERE IGNORANT OF.------ THE CAMPAIGN CHANGED CULTURAL NORMS, AND MADE SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.-------THE CURRENT ADVERTS ARE A WELCOME FIRST STEP TOWARDS A RETURN TO THIS WAY-OF THINKING, BUT IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THEY WILL HAVE ANY TRUE OR LASTING AFFECT UNLESS THE CAMPAIGN IS SUSTAINED AND BROADENED OUT TO A WIDER AUDIENCE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVICES, AT A TIME WHEN DIAGNOSES OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS ARE SOARING.-------------- IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PROMISED AX-------300 MILLION, THREE-YEAR PROGRAMME TO----- "MODERNISE AND TRANSFORM SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND.-----" HOWEVER, AS WAS REVEALED IN AUGUST, MORE THAN 80% OF PRIMARY CARE TRUSTS (PCTS) HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO USE THIS MONEY SOLELY FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE; MUCH OF THE----- "SEXUAL HEALTH-----" BUDGET HAS IN FACT GONE TOWARDS PAYING OFF DEBTS. THE CHANNEL 4 NEWS REPORT LOOKED AT THE IMPACT OF THE RESULTANT UNDERFUNDING.------------------- "THE ALLOCATION FOR THIS AREA WAS OVERX-------200,000 RECURRENTLY,-----" SAID DR COLM O'MAHONEY, A HOSPITAL CONSULTANT WHO TWO YEARS AGO HELPED THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINE HOW MUCH SPENDING WAS NEEDED.----- "THE PCT I WORK IN HAS AX-------42.5 MILLION DEBT AND THEY'RE USING ALL OF THE MONEY TO BAIL OUT THAT DEBT.-----" OF THEX-------200,000, HE HAS RECEIVED----- "NOT ONE SINGLE PENNY-----".-------------- PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF-HEALTH'S STRATEGY WAS A NATIONAL CHLAMYDIA SCREENING PROGRAMME, WHICH AIMED TO COVER THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND BY MARCH------ THAT TARGET IS NOW UNLIKELY TO BE MET. AT LEAST 30 PCTS HAVE ALREADY WITHHELD MONEY FROM SCREENING, ACCORDING-TO CHANNEL 4 NEWS, AND ANOTHER TWO TRUSTS HAVE ACTUALLY SUSPENDED THEIR SCREENING PROGRAMMES.-------------- WIRRAL CHLAMYDIA SCREENING PROGRAMME WAS THE FIRST-OF ITS KIND, AND SERVED AS A MODEL FOR THE NATIONAL SCREENING PROGRAMME, YET TODAY IT DOES NOT SCREEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PEOPLE THAN IT DID THREE-OR FOUR YEARS AGO.-ITS DIRECTOR, DR JENNY HOPWOOD, SAID THE SITUATION WAS----- "SERIOUS-----" AND THAT AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER WOULD PROBABLY NOT JUDGE THE PROGRAMME A SUCCESS.-------------- ACCORDING TO DR KATE GUTHRIE OF THE FACULTY OF PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, WIRRAL IS FAR FROM AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE:------------------- "CLINICS HAVE BEEN CUT, SENIOR STAFF HAVE NOT-BEEN REPLACED,-THE HOURS OF CLINICS ARE BEING ALTERED BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER TO RUN DURING THE-DAY, BUT ACTUALLY THEIR CLIENTELE WANT THEM IN THE EVENINGS AND AT WEEKENDS,-----" SHE SAID.----- "WE CAN'T PROVIDE SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE-YET VERY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION, AND WE SOMETIMES HAVEN'T EVEN GOT ENOUGH SUPPORT STAFF TO KEEP THE CLINICS OPEN.------------------------" "NO ONE IS PREPARED TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND I'M VERY SADDENED INDEED,-----" SAID PROFESSOR MIKE ADLER,-THE UK'S MOST SENIOR SEXUAL HEALTH CONSULTANT, WHO FIVE YEARS AGO WROTE THE NATIONAL SEXUAL HEALTH STRATEGY.----- "I HAD OBVIOUSLY HOPED THAT HAVING THE VERY FIRST SEXUAL HEALTH STRATEGY WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A MINOR REVOLUTION... THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED... THINGS HAVE GOT WORSE.-------------------" ANOTHER VICTIM OF UNDERFUNDING IS THE LONG-AWAITED PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOW NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF OVERDUE. THE MESSAGES SHOULD START BEING BROADCAST IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME, BUT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE AS MUCH IMPACT AS WAS PLANNED. ONLYX-------7.5 MILLION WILL BE SPENT ON THE CAMPAIGN, INSTEAD OF THEX-------50 MILLION PROMISED BY GOVERNMENT.-------------- IN RESPONSE TO CHANNEL 4 NEWS' FINDINGS, PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTER CAROLINE FLINT SAID SHE WAS----- "DISAPPOINTED-----" THAT SO MANY SEXUAL HEALTH EXPERTS WERE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE. SHE SAID-THAT IT WAS UP-TO PCTS TO DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY THEY WERE GIVEN, AND THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A NATIONAL CHLAMYDIA SCREENING PROGRAMME AND OVER-THE-COUNTER TESTING KITS WERE AMONG RECENT POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS.-------------- AVERT.ORG HAS MORE ABOUT----------------------------- STD STATISTICS AND SEXUAL HEALTH IN THE UK----.--------------------------------------------------------- (-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANNEL 4 NEWS----, 02/11/06)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHILDREN ACROSS LONDON TO LEARN ABOUT HIV AND AIDS--------------------------------------------------------2ND NOVEMBER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006 SCHOOLS ACROSS LONDON IN THE UK ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH AN HIV AND AIDS EDUCATION KIT IN A NEW INITIATIVE TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE ILLNESS BY THE CHARITY CRUSAID.-------------- THEX-------AWAREX------- MEDIA KIT IS DESIGNED TO FULFILL THEX-------MEDIA STUDIES------- COMPONENT OF THE COMPULSORY GCSE ENGLISH SYLLABUS.------ IT ASKS PUPILS TO WATCH A NUMBER OF HISTORICAL AIDS AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS, SUCH AS THE FAMOUS TOMBSTONE ADVERTS OF THE 1980S, AND THEN CREATE A MEDIA CAMPAIGN OF THEIR OWN.-------------- THE IDEA IS THAT THE PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY INSPIRE CREATIVITY AND HELP STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND MODERN MEDIA PRODUCATION PROCESSES, BUT WILL ALSO GAVE THEM VITAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIV AND AIDS.------------------- "TEACHERS INVOLVED IN THE PILOT HAVE WELCOMED THE-PACK WHICH TACKLES THE SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF HIV AND AIDS AS PART OF REGULAR COURSEWORK, MAKING IT EASIER FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES OPENLY,------- SAID STEVEN INMAN, HEAD OF GRANTS AND PROJECTS AT CRUSAID.--------------------------- "THIS IS A VITAL STEP TOWARD A NATIONAL HIV AND AIDS PREVENTION DRIVE IN SCHOOLS.--------------X------ THE KIT-HAS INITIALLY BEEN SENT ONLY TO SCHOOLS IN LONDON, BUT IT IS HOPED THAT CRUSAID WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO SECURE GOVERNMENT FUNDING SO THAT IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE.-------------- TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIV AND AIDS EDUCATION, PLEASE VISIT OUR------------------------------------------- HIV---- & AIDS EDUCATION---- SECTION.-------------------------------------------------------------------- (--------------------------------------------------------------------24DASH.COM----,--------------------------------------------------------------- 01/11/06 & CRUSAID EDUCATION WEBSITE----)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHURCH OF ENGLAND APPOINTS HIV+ PRIEST--------------------------------------------------------11TH SEPTEMBER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE UK, A CLERGYMAN LIVING WITH HIV HAS BEEN APPOINTED AS A PARISH PRIEST.-------------- THE NEW VICAR, WHO HAS ASKED NOT TO BE NAMED, WILL TAKE UP HIS POST AT A CHURCH IN LONDON LATER THIS MONTH.------ HE WAS APPOINTED BY AN ASSISTANT BISHOP KNOWN TO BE A SUPPORTER OF THE CAMPAIGN TO ALLOW GAY CLERGYMEN TO PRACTICE AS PRIESTS WITHIN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.------ THE PRIEST IS BELIEVED TO BE OPENLY GAY, BUT HAS PLEDGED TO REFRAIN FROM SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHILE IN OFFICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHURCH OF ENGLAND RULES.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT 47% OF THE TEENAGERS HAD EVER HAD VAGINAL SEX, AND 62% OF THEM REPORTED CONDOM USE ON THE MOST RECENT OCCASION. AMONG THESE CONDOM USERS, SIX PER CENT REPORTED APPLYING THE CONDOM AFTER INITIAL PENETRATION, AND ANOTHER SIX PER CENT REMOVED THE CONDOM BEFORE STOPPING SEX.------------- AMONG THOSE WHO KEPT DIARIES, 31% SAID THEY HAD EXPERIENCED LATE CONDOM APPLICATION AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD, AND 9% REPORTED EARLY REMOVAL.------------- THE MOST COMMON REASONS GIVEN FOR APPLYING A CONDOM LATE WERE INTIMACY, THAT IT FEELS BETTER WITHOUT, THAT OTHER CONTRACEPTION WAS USED, AND THAT THEY GOT CARRIED AWAY. ONLY IN ONE INSTANCE WAS A CONDOM APPLIED LATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS - ON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS TEENAGERS WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT AVOIDING PREGNANCY, PREVENTING MESS OR MAKING SEX LAST LONGER.------------- YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LACKED CONFIDENCE IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF CORRECT CONDOM USAGE WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE CONDOMS INCONSISTENTLY.

GIVEN THAT MEMBERS OF THESE GROUPS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK IN THE UK AND ARE OFTEN POOR, MANY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD THE CHARGES.-------------- THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT THE AIM OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO PREVENTX-------TREATMENT TOURISM-------, WHERE PEOPLE COME TO THE COUNTRY WITH THE AIM OF BENEFITING FROM FREE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY.

WOMAN SENT TO JAIL FOR TRANSMITTING HIV--------------------------------------------------------20TH JUNE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006 A SECOND BRITISH WOMAN HAS BEEN SENT TO JAIL FOR INFECTING A LOVER WITH HIV.-------------- SARAH JANE PORTER KNEW THAT SHE HAD HIV WHEN SHE EMBARKED ON A TWO-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PARTNER, A 31-YEAR-OLD DJ FROM LONDON, BUT HAD REPEATED UNPROTECTED SEX WITH-HIM AND FAILED TO INFORM HIM OF HER STATUS, RESULTING IN HIM BECOMING INFECTED WITH HIV HIMSELF.------ WHEN HE TOLD HER OF HIS HIV+ TEST RESULT, SHE THEN ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING INFECTED HER.-------------- PSYCHOLOGISTS TOLD THE COURT THAT MISS PORTER WAS IN COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT HER HIV+ STATUS AND VERY FEARFUL OF THE SOCIAL STIGMA ATTACHED TO IT, WHICH MEANT SHE FELT UNABLE TO ADMIT HER CONDITION.------ SHE DID HOWEVER PLEAD GUILTY TO CHARGES OF RECKLESSLY CAUSING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM IN COURT, AND EXPRESSED REGRET AT THE HURT SHE HAD CAUSED.------ SHE WAS SENTENCED TO 32 MONTHS IN JAIL.-------------- THIS CASE IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF CRIMINAL HIV TRANSMISSION CASES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, WHICH MANY AIDS ORGANISATIONS SAY SHOWS A WORRYING RETURN OF THE CULTURE OF BLAME AND-STIGMA THAT SURROUNDED THE EPIDEMIC-IN THE EARLY YEARS.-------------- AVERT, LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHER HIV AND AIDS CHARITIES, IS SYMPATHETIC TO ANYONE WHO BECOMES INFECTED WITH HIV AND STRONGLY DISCOURAGES ANYONE FROM CONCEALING THEIR HIV+ STATUS FROM THEIR PARTNER.------ WE FULLY RECOGNISE THE DISTRESS CAUSED BY A POSITIVE HIV TEST RESULT, THE DIFFICULTIES OF LIVING WITH HIV, AND THE BETRAYAL FELT BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE PERSON THEY LOVE, SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS CASE CHOSE TO PURSUE THIS MATTER IN A COURT OF LAW.-------------- HOWEVER, AVERT ALSO HOLDS THE POSITION THAT THE CURRENT METHOD OF CRIMINALISINGX-------RECKLESS------- TRANSMISSION IS VERY UNHELPFUL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT OF DISCRIMINATION AND STIGMA.-------------- THE FACT THAT RECKLESS HIV TRANSMISSION IS NOW POTENTIALLY A CRIMINAL MATTER, MEANS THAT THE POLICE ARE ASSUMING THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FULLY INVESTIGATE ANYONE THEY SUSPECT OF HAVING PASSED ON HIV, SOMETIMES ON THE MOST TENUOUS OF HEAR-SAY EVIDENCE.------ THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST MISS PORTER WAS FILED BY A MAN WITH WHOM SHE HAD RECENTLY SPLIT UP.------ THIS MAN WAS HIV NEGATIVE, BUT HIS ACCOUNT LEAD POLICE TO SEARCH MISS PORTER'S FLAT FOR EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS PARTNERS, AN INVESTIGATION WHICH EVENTUALLY LED THEM TO A 31-YEAR OLD DJ, WHO WAS HIV+ AND WILLING TO TAKE HIS FORMER GIRLFRIEND TO COURT.------ SUCH INVESTIGATIONS REPRESENT A GROSS INVASION OF PRIVACY, AND PAINT A WORRYING PICTURE OF A POLICE FORCE THAT IS WASTING MANY MAN HOURS ACTIVELY TRACKING DOWN AND ENCOURAGING FORMER PARTNERS TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.------ SUCH ACTIVITY MAY BE PORTRAYED AS JUSTIFIED IN CASES SUCH AS MISS PORTER'S, WHERE A CONVICTION WAS ULTIMATELY OBTAINED, BUT IT IS BELIEVED THAT IN MANY INSTANCES, POLICE WILL RAID HOMES AND SEIZE MEDICAL RECORDS OF ENTIRELY INNOCENT PEOPLE, PURELY ON THE BASIS OF A COMPLAINT FROM A FORMER LOVER SEEKING REVENGE.-------------- WHEN CASES SUCH AS MISS PORTER'S DO THEN GET TAKEN TO COURT, THEY OFTEN END IN PRISON SENTENCES FOR THE DEFENDANT. UK PRISONS ARE ALREADY OVERCROWDED, AND MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HIV TRANSMISSION INSIDE PRISONS IS A COMMON OCCURANCE.------ A PRISON SENTENCE IS ALSO UNLIKELY TO HELP THE GUILTY PARTY (OR INDEED THE VICTIM) COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR HIV STATUS OR CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR, NOR IS IT GOING TO ACT AS A DETERRENT TO OTHERSX------- THE LAW RARELY FEATURES AS A POINT OF CONSIDERATION IN THE BEDROOM, AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE HUGE NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEX UNDER AGE.------ WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT IF CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS ARE TO TAKE PLACE AT ALL, PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELLING TO HELP END THEIR DENIAL ABOUT THEIR STATUS WOULD BE A FAR MORE USEFUL OUTCOME, AND BETTER STILL, HIV CAMPAIGNS AND EDUCATION SHOULD BE MADE FAR MORE PROMINENT TO HELP PEOPLE PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM INFECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE.-------------- HIGH PROFILE COURT CASES ON SUCH PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP MATTERS ARE OFTEN LENGTHY, AND HIGHLY STRESSFUL FOR BOTH SIDES (INDEED, A NUMBER OFX-------VICTIMS------- NOW REGRET HAVING TRIED TO GET JUSTICE THROUGH A COURT OF LAW).------ THEY CAN ALSO HEIGHTEN THE STIGMA AND IDEA OF BLAME AROUND THE DISEASE (WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MISS PORTER FAILED TO TELL HER PARTNER ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE) AND COULD PUT PEOPLE OFF TESTING FOR HIV, IN THE BELIEF THAT IF THEY DON-------T KNOW THEIR STATUS, THEY CAN-------T GET PROSECUTED.------ FINALLY, THEY ALSO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING CONDOMS ON ONE PERSON, WHEN IT SHOULD OF COURSE BE A SHARED DECISION WHEREVER POSSIBLE.-------------- IN LIGHT OF THESE COMPLEXITIES, AND INDEED MANY OTHERS THAT ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN OUR------------------------------------ CRIMINAL TRANSMISSION PAGE----, AVERT BELIEVES THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE LAW IN THIS AREA, TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE POLICE, JUDGES AND THE PRESS ON HOW TO HANDLE CASES SUCH AS THESE, AND TO ENSURE THAT STIGMA, MISINFORMATION AND DAMAGE TO PUBLIC HEALTH ARE KEPT TO A MINIMUM.------------------------------------------------------------------ (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE

REPORT ON ITS PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE DECLARATION OF COMMITMENT GOALS BEFORE THE UN'S DEADLINE IN DECEMBER.-------------- SUCH INFORMATION HAS WORRIED MANY AIDS ORGANISATIONS IN THE UK, WHO FEAR THAT THE RECENT FOCUS ON AIDS IN AFRICA IS LEADING PEOPLE (AND APPARENTLY THE GOVERNMENT) TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY.-------------- THERE IS HOWEVER SOME GOOD NEWS.------ TREATMENT OF HIV IN THE UK IS SECOND-TO-NONE, WITH EVERYONE ENTITLED TO TREATMENT RECEIVING OPTIMAL CARE.------ THE DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT NOW ENSURES THAT HIV+ PEOPLE CANNOT LEGALLY BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, AND MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REDUCED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS THANKS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPT-OUT ANTENATAL HIV SCREENING.------ SOME
