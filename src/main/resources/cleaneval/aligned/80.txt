is□slight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly □□□subjects differ□drastically in the□□□□ relative strength of their foundations, or in
the□apparent □□□fundamentality of their□□□□ concepts, methods, principles,□theories, achievements, research, language, logic, etc.
□□□□□□□Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines
to□discover□□□□ analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences,
contradictions,□redundancies, interpenetrations, convergences, common
goals and needs,□unities, etc. □□□It can use these to suggest □□□□omissions,
errors, common□opportunities for research or discovery, ways to
redescribe the foundations□of one subject in terms of the foundations
of another, reciprocal problems□and fallacies, equivalent principles
and entities, joint ignorance, new□tests and experiments, higher
standards, useful priorities, strategies□of theory, etc.
□□□□It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain
concepts□or dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible or
important concepts□or things, or the spaces and manifolds thereof.
Contained or implicit within□such sets, spaces, and manifolds may be
concepts or other things that can□supplement or deepen the foundations
of the subject to which they pertain.
□□□□Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged
perspectives□upon what is possible may lead to the realization that
what has been taken□to be fundamental within a subject is not really
fundamental; or at least,□that the foundations--or supposed
foundations--of the subject are not as□free of assumptions, problems,
inelegant features, superfluous elements,□discrepancies, idiosyncratic
aspects, etc as has been thought.
□□□□Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts,
dimensions,□representations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles,
relationships,□etc that are □□□supremely□□□□ universal, fundamental,
important, essential,□minimal, logical, generative, necessary,
transcendental, and pantological,□it is in a privileged position to
advance the foundations of arbitrary□fields.
□□□□It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences
more□scientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by
rectifying, enlarging,□and extending the foundations of these subjects.
□□□□There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering
some□unsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either
ideas□or things, or that transcends what is meant by both the "mental"
and "physical''□aspects of reality.
□□□□By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic
scales--as□of duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or
entropy--ideonomy□can call the mind's attention to what is only
naturally the most and least□fundamental in a subject, to the way in
which things derive their greater□or lesser fundamentality from one
another, to the direction in which that□which is truly or most
fundamental is apt to be found, or to the properties□that fundamentals
or foundations are likely to or must have.
□□□□Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impaired□by
a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define,
characterize,□or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final
topic, concept, phenomenon,□substance, law, entity, goal, or the like
of the subject (or the set of□such things). Then again, the supreme
topic or whatever may have some terrible□unsolved problem or difficulty
associated with it.
□□□□Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch
concern□of sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux,
the essential□nature or defining properties of life are unknown to the
science of life□(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of
mathematics (it□cannot be □□□number□□□□, though the nature of number is an
enigma in any□case), cosmology (what is the described or effable
'universe' □□□itself□□□□□a part of?), and ideonomy (□□□ideas□□□□, as hinted above,
may not be sufficiently□fundamental) is mysterious.
□□□□Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more
fundamental□ways, and it has already been used to define life, or to
reduce it to a□set of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of
8,464 possible dyadic□combinations of the primary properties have
demonstrated such extraordinary□interest that they promise to
revolutionize theoretical biology, something□which at once illustrates
the importance of clarifying fundamentals and□suggests that the traits
that were used to define the phenomenon of "life"□were indeed
fundamental.
□□□□On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also
highlighted□the problems that plague all efforts to resolve
fundamentals or to get□at the genuine foundations of a subject; for it
was found that the same□set of ninety-two basic properties of "life"
have either analogs or exact□equivalents in the supposedly inanimate
phenomena of subjects other than□biology. Thus forms or analogs of
procreation, natural selection, and evolution□either may or do exist in
fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,□and cosmology.
The implication may variously be that life is not limited□or peculiar
to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or defined□via other
properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should include□more
than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a
superscience□incorporating many other sciences or that--like
mathematics--applies to□all science.
□□□□An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by
improving,□formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just
now emerging□way, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the
form of thought□itself. Ideonomy can help with both of these
approaches, particularly in□conjunction with computer software and
hardware.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Erect Frameworks For Thought□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual
framework,□a schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop,
interweave, and□experiment upon different concepts.
□□□□Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes,
structures,□and systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope,
diversify them,□enhance their power, increase their connectivity or
interrelatedness, greaten□their mobility within and between fields,
enlarge their rationality or□make their logic more explicit, give the
individual the power to freely□manipulate them, etc.
□□□□The concept of □□□mental frameworks□□□□ is so important to ideonomy□that it
needs to be expanded upon. By it we mean an open-ended set of
□□□:□schemes, structures, systems, and 'machines' of□□□□ : ideas, relations,□principles, presuppositions, facts, arguments, thoughts,
beliefs, values,□purposes, perspectives, methods, strategies, gestalts,
analyses, attitudes,□percepts, images, definitions, explanations,
dimensions, symbols, criteria,□representations, models, heuristics,
postulates, generalizations, theories,□procedures, wisdoms, stories,
memories, analogies, rules, mental associations,□etc : □□□serving or for
furthering thought.□□□□□□□□□□□□Such mental schematizations of□□□□: experience, the environment,□reality,
behavior, human existence, or possibility : □□□can be□□□□ : conscious□or
unconscious : formal or informal : specific, general, or universal
□□□ad□hoc□□□□ or perpetual (evolutionary) : deductive or inductive :
empirical□or theoretical : categorical or experimental : developing or
inert : etc.
□□□□□□□The diverse values and uses of cognitive frameworks include□□□□:□mental
simplification; clustering, grouping, and classifying of ideas
and□facts; explication and coordination of different purposes and
goals; structuring□of memories in hierarchies, series, networks, trees,
vergences, rings or□cycles, foliations, meta-stories, etc-that are
especially dynamic, powerful,□natural, efficient, dense, optimal, etc;
recursive, self-developing, nucleative,□and self-correcting properties
or effects; the multidimensional mental□parallax given by a
multitude-of such frameworks; provision of a stable□apparatus for
developing and maintaining mental skills; standardization□within the mind (□□□□□□□□□□□ la□□□□ worldwide industrial and scientific□standardization);
provision of bases for tests, evaluations, investigations,□and
experiments; limitation of thought to what is necessary and
obviation□of trivial and repetitive thought and creativity; bases for
communication□among different minds and for comparisons of their
contents; enabling of□more precise and rigorous thought; codification
of though! acceleration□of thought; enabling of overviews of
experience, the world, one's conduct,□and the mind; greater mental
flexibility and self-control; readier learning;□quick or more powerful
structuring of materials, subjects, problems, or□situations; automation
of mental habits and of ideation; heightened clarity□of mind; etc.
□□□□Frameworks for thought can enable a topic to be taught, mastered,
or□treated more deeply or completely. They can provide clues for
probing the□nature of a thing. They can enable more imaginative or less
prejudiced□thought. They can help one to prepare for a more serious
intellectual endeavor.□They can help one relate one perspective to
another, or permit one to grasp□a new thing by analogy to an old or
familiar thing.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Enumerate the Functions of□A Thing□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Things may, and usually do, have far more numerous and diverse
functions,□roles, and importances than people realize or would even
imagine. □□□If□this is true, it has great significance:□□□□□□□□□Features of our world may be carelessly eliminated or altered by
the□ignorant march of progress or change; All existing things may have
a web□of ecological relationships that merit study and respect; Things
may all□be beneficiaries of many more things than has been thought;
There may be□an unsuspectedly great number of ways to change and
improve the world or□its things; etc.
□□□□□□□Among the possible generic functions of things are□□□□:
Mediation;□Prevention; Protection; Connection; Transportation;
Communication; Symbolization;□Testing; Facilitation; Amplification;
Imitation or substitution; Extension;□Generalization; Specialization;
Correction; Improvement; Balancing; Sublimation□or domestication;
Counteraction; Elimination; Supplementation;
Complementation;□Exploitation; Coping; Hiding or deception; Showing;
Production; Concentration□or confinement; Combination or integration;
Separation, division, or liberation;□Ordering; Maintenance or supply;
Storage, holding, preservation, or conservation;□Preparation;
Initiation; Control or management; Adjustment or
modulation;□Transcendence, circumvention, or obviation; Orientation;
Reduction or economization□(enhancement of efficiency); Transformation;
Etc.
□□□□□□□Ideonomy can help answer such questions about functions as:□□□□□□□□□How do functions overlap?
□□□□What functions are competitive? What functions are cooperative,
complementary,□or synergistic?
□□□□What functions are illusory, misleading, or ambiguous?
□□□□What are all of the degrees of functions of things? What are the

□□□□What are all possible or important categories of ignorance and
knowledge□about functions? What are the actual extent, qualities, and

function--or□that does not do so?
□□□□What are all of the self-functions of things?
□□□□What set of questions should be asked when treating functions? How

the ways in which some of□the questions can and should be iterated?
□□□□As results piled up worldwide from the habitual, ubiquitous, and

□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Foster Wisdom About the Future□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□There are many ways in which one could be wise or wiser about
the□future□□□□; e.g. one could simply □□□attend to it□□□□ more closely,
or□appreciate better the fleeting nature of the present or of things as
they□now are; one could systematically examine the □□□range of□□□□ future □□□possibilities□□□□;□one could visualize the various □□□alternative courses□□□□ the
world might□take□□□□□□□□in the future, and the □□□things apt to determine□□□□□which□particular set of courses the world will actually follow; one
could □□□identify□□□□□the world's □□□needs□□□□ in advancing into the future, and
endeavor to□□□□provide for□□□□ those needs and wants; one could help to
□□□educate□□□□□all present and future humanity to deal with the future; one
could attempt□to □□□influence□□□□ the actual course the world will take
tomorrow, or□to push it toward what would be good and away from what
would be evil or□inferior; one could labor to produce general □□□methods□□□□
for foreseeing□or altering the future; etc.
□□□□Of course the future being referred to need not be that of the world□as
a whole or represented by the future in its entirety, but on the
contrary□might be arbitrarily modest: one's own future lifetime,
perhaps, or tomorrow's□events or the events of the next minute, or the
momentary or instantaneous□outcome of a scientific experiment that
someone is performing or whose□performance is simply being
contemplated.
□□□□Becoming wiser about the future might mean nothing more than
divesting□oneself of prejudicial ideas, attitudes, beliefs, or world
views, becoming□friendlier--or more hostile--to innovation, reducing
the irrational inertia□of institutions, or paying more attention to the
patterns and lessons of□history that might be analogous or relevant to
the future.
□□□□□□□Among the fallacies that diminish wisdom about the future, and
that□ideonomy could help to combat, are that□□□□: the future will simply
repeat□the past; the course of the future is predetermined and
inalterable; the□world of the present represents the best of all
possible worlds; human□knowledge and wisdom are nearly complete and
perfect--and our ignorance□small and unimportant; the future is too
complex or esoteric for us to□anticipate its character or
possibilities--and past failures and inability□to correctly foresee the
future were unavoidable, and should be looked□upon as a warning that
all prophecy is folly; etc.
□□□□□□□Ideonomy could be used to□□□□: devise new, or suggest all possible,□methods
for studying future possibilities; survey, describe, compare,
evaluate,□criticize, correct, extend, integrate, and transcend □□□all past
and present□□□□□prophetic methods, endeavors, and results; identify the
totality of things□that can or should have their future possibilities
considered; predict□the future interrelationships and interactions of
these things; indicate□the future's □□□most fundamental □□□□dimensions,
structure, forces, elements,□patterns, laws, etc; formulate principles
for treating the future; develop□novel means for representing and
dramatizing the future's possibilities□(e.g. diagrams, organons,
computer software and simulations new types of□books, special language
and idea spaces, artificial intelligence programs,□etc); suggest all
possible causes, effects, and conditions of future possibilities;□rank
the relative and absolute probability and importance of all
future□possibilities; indicate the different roles and functions that
things are□apt to have in the future; and so forth.
□□□□□□□Some of the specific questions and other issues that ideonomy
could□help to address are□□□□: What should be maximized and minimized in
the□future? What new rights may become political issues in the future?
What□human freedoms must ultimately be restrained for the good of all?
What□present concerns of government will be retired and what new
concerns will□take their place? What means are there for maximizing the
future diversity□and complexity of civilization? What were the laws of
history, insofar□as they apply to the future as well? How ambiguous is
the future or are□its possibilities? What meta-structures are
applicable to the study of□the future or will actually describe its
possibilities: incl. chains, series,□trees, networks, hierarchies,
vergences, etc? What elements of the present□will disappear or endure
in the future? What new discoveries, inventions,□creations, and other
innovations are possible, probable, or certain in□the future? What
developments can continue □□□ad infinitum □□□□and which□must have limits? In
what ways is the future apt to surprise us? What are□all the future
possibilities of a single, random or particular, thing?□What future
possibilities would be synergistic or antagonistic? In what□order must
different things happen?
□□□□□□□Illustrative examples of specific future possibilities are□□□□: Elimination□of the need for sleep; Chinese democratic revolution; Life
discovered elsewhere□in the cosmos; Legalization of prostitution;
Replacement of stores by teleshopping□and robotized delivery of goods
to homes; Evolution of a single panhuman□language; Reduction of physics
to 'pure' logic; New age of dirigibles;□Exploration of a single cave
'pushed' to 100,000 kilometers (using miniature□humanoid
teleoperators); Mechanical pets and computer- simulated plants□more
popular than biological organisms; Family car replaced by a
flying□equivalent; irrefutable scientific proof of the existence of
'God'; Temporal□metric system adopted; War fought using beams of
elementary particles so□exotic that they have not yet been imagined;
Time's apparently unique and□irreversible flow shown to be a physical
illusion; Mining of Earth's mantle;□Every organism on Earth transformed
into a different species; New human□sexes added to the traditional two;
Complete obsolescence of the family;□Lamps made to last centuries;
immortality made compulsory; Ethics remade□into an exact science;
Deliberate suicide of the human race, subjectively□rendered irrelevant
by its own transhuman mechanical creations; Ideonomy□taught at all
grade levels in all schools; War everywhere ended by the□introduction
of "peace pills" (irenic psychopharmaceuticals); Etc.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Generalize Notions□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□One can use ideonomy to help to generalize or even universalize any□and
all notions and things.
□□□□Over time things often prove to be insufficiently generalized. That□is,
the essential idea or set of ideas associated with them turn out
to□have greater meaning, scope, or application than what is initially
--or□perhaps than is ever at any finite moment--thought to be the case.
□□□□Actually it is probably true that in some sense the generality of
all□concepts, and all concepts of things, must always be at once
inadequate□and excessive.
□□□□But according to an ideonomic principle it is of the utmost
importance□that the generality of all concepts constantly be enlarged
over time, or□advanced toward infinity. Naturally in the course of such
progressive generalization□the concepts will undergo fundamental
metamorphoses, yet a form of semantic□continuity may be apparent in
retrospect that was prospectively invisible□or even meaningless.
□□□□It could be said that all concepts are inherently infinite in
meaning,□and even that this infinite aspect is close to their essence.
□□□□To generalize - according to the dictionary - is to make general
reduce□to general laws : give a general form to; to derive or induce (a
general□conception or principle) from particulars; to derive or induce
a general□conception, principle, or inference from; to make general (as
by existential□or universal qualification) : render applicable to a
wider class; to give□general applicability to; to modify or eliminate
(nonessential details)□for emphasizing some particular feature; to
portray or emphasize general□rather than particular features and
characteristics of.
□□□□□□□Illustrative examples of generalizations of ideas and
things□□□□:□Historically, the generalization of the legal concept of a
□□□person□□□□□to include corporations and other organizations, even though
these contain□many human beings; □□□Energy□□□□ has been generalized to include mass;□Some quantum physicists would generalize the concept of a
□□□physical phenomenon□□□□□to include the apparatus used to measure the
phenomenon, the observer,□or even the observational or mensurational
act; A few physicists would□go even further, and define any □□□phenomenon□□□□
as perforce including□the whole universe or all of spacetime; Certain
modern composers generalize□the notion of □□□musical scale□□□□ to include any
systematic or recurrent□arrangement of notes on which a composition is
based; The concept of □□□intelligence□□□□□has been generalized to include
animals that were formerly regarded as□mindless; □□□Skeletal and muscular

of the □□□nervous system□□□□ to include equivalents□in unicellular

stars (as superstars) may equal or exceed (dwarf) galaxies□in size; The
progressive generalization of the concept of number in the□history of
mathematics to ever more abstract, strange ' numerous, and
'less□number-like' things (imaginary numbers being one of the more
famous products□of this process); Over history the concept of □□□evolution□□□□
has become□ever more generalized--to embrace not only biology (life;
the phylogeny□of species, ontogeny of bionts, and life-long
biosynthesis of molecules,□organelles, etc) but geology (Earth and
other planets; the evolution of□continents, mountains, geospheres,
etc), astronomy (stars, galaxies perhaps,□and the universe as a whole),
physics (matter, energy, space, time, physical□laws and constants
perhaps, etc), society, industry, economies, the mind,□ethics, the
arts, etc; □□□Mental illness□□□□ has been generalized to include□normal mental
states and individuals (on the belief that the difference□is only one
of degree, perspective, or concern)--and □□□mental normality□□□□□has been
generalized to include mental illness (e.g. based on the belief□that
the latter may be rational, coherent, or productive when viewed
internally,□from a different or larger perspective, or with an
awareness that society□is universally illogical and insane); □□□Learning□□□□□might be generalized□to include selective forgetting, unlearning, and
progressive inhibition;□The concepts of □□□publishing, book, and magazine□□□□
can be generalized□to include novel forms and products of electronic
publishing; The concept□of □□□color□□□□ might be generalized to include the
static and dynamic□meanings of pseudocolors in different or all
possible situations--or simply□to perceptual and cognitive patterns
apparent in □□□temporal□□□□ successions□and combinations of □□□regular□□□□ colors;
Over the course of history the□concept or subject of science has
broadened unremittingly, to the extent□that it now includes the study
of: art □□□qua□□□□ aesthetics, musicology,□philology, etc.; money, wealth, and
economic systems □□□qua□□□□ economics;□governments and governance □□□qua□□□□

□□□□□□□Examples of things that may have been inadequately generalized or□that
may be generalized in the future:□□□□□□□□□□□□Humor□□□□: If precursors, rudiments', theriomorphic variants, or□analogs of
laughter or a risibles are eventually found in animals other□than man,
generalization of the concept or phenomenon of humor (its
origin,□functions, mechanisms, types, properties, referents, states,
logics, degrees,□scope, etc) may turn out to be desirable or necessary;
□□□□□□□Machine□□□□: The concept of a machine may have to be generalized□so as to
include biological phenomena (e.g. genomes, protein
molecules,□micelles, organelles, cells, organs, biochemical networks
and processes,□bodily macro- systems such as the nervous and immune
systems, organisms,□ecosystems, and the hypothetically Gaian bios),
various phenomena and entities□in pure and applied mathematics--or even
logic, chemical reactions, crystals,□diversely intelligent computers;
models, simulations, and even scientific□theories; human languages and
computer programs; geological and meteorological□phenomena such as
volcanoes and storms, the 'universe', man's mind or society,□pure or
real-world ideas, physical laws, statistical and quantum phenomena□in
physics, economic systems, political ideologies, ethical systems,
and□symphonies;
□□□□□□□Food□□□□: This should include 'nutritive' atmospheric gases;
conceivably□organisms get some genes or genic influences directly from
food (via "lateral□gene flow"); the body is forever 'consuming itself'
(in strange and little-□known senses); even inanimate phenomena 'eat'
or require 'nutrition' from□their environment; conceivably the
seemingly stable and self-existent macroscopic□world, with its
delomorphic baryons and leptons, is in reality being
dynamically□maintained and replenished from below, or by chains,
fountains, singularities,□plexiform or vergent hierarchies, or the like
ascending from the ultramicroscopic□level of zero-point, Bore], Dirac-
vacuum, Wheeler-prespace, or Bohm-implicate□order fluctuations; and the
mind 'eats' ideas;
□□□□□□□House□□□□: This concept should be generalized to include the diverse□homes
(-nests, burrows, cavities, interstices, webs, mounds, hollow
trees,□logs, host exteriors and interiors, atmospheric dust and cloud
particles,□etc) of all organisms; shells, exoskeletons, skin, bodies,
the skull and□blood-brain barrier, etc; cells, plasmalemmas, misc.
membranes, etc; ecological□niches, ecosystems, and the bios; as well as
the 'houses' of inanimate□phenomena: atmospheres, planets, the
heliosphere, the galactic atmosphere,□the universe, factories, etc;
□□□□□□□Universe□□□□: Generalizing this terribly presumptuous concept might□be
appropriate if there are other universes or quasi-external parts of□our
universe, Everett's Many-Worlds Cosmology is real, most of the mass□of
the universe is invisible and exotic stuff, there is an infinite
microcosm,□Bohm's Implicate Order exists, etc; or to take account of
Wheeler's Superspace,□the omniverse (all of spacetime), physicomental
"reality", and the Ideocosm.

□□□□What are all possible, all nonequivalent, all specialized, and all
hierarchical□generalizations □□□of□□□□ or regarding a □□□single□□□□, random or particular,□□□□thing□□□□?
□□□□□□□How can□□□□ or should □□□all things□□□□, or all sets of types of□things, □□□be□□□□□progressively □□□generalized□□□□ into, □□□with respect□to□□□□, or on the basis of,
□□□one another?□□□□□□□□□What are all human □□□motivations□□□□ for generalizing and not
generalizing□any and all things in any and all ways in any and all
circumstances; and□what are all of the psychodynamics thereof? What are
the total ideonomic□interests of these things?
□□□□What are the current □□□frontiers□□□□ of generalization of things by□mankind?
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Suggest Goals□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Many enterprises are launched, conducted, and even consummated
with□almost no attention paid to their possible, actual, or appropriate
goals.
□□□□□□□Yet this can cause many problems and have many costs, e.g.□□□□:
Inefficiency;□Failure to make adequate or correct provision or
preparation; Inability□to notice and rectify a faulty course; Taking of
excessive or unnecessary□risks, perhaps unconsciously; Blindness to
opportunities; Indecision and□inaction in crises; Indirection and
aimless wandering; Lack of plans and□priorities; Inability to optimize
the use--and mindless wastage--of finite□resources; Anarchy;
Distractibility; Inaction; Anomie and tedium; Lack□of motivation;
Inconsistencies, contradictions, and disharmonies; Impossibility□of
cooperative endeavor; Inability to structure existence; Fragility of□an
enterprise and a tendency for it to degenerate and fragment;
Inability□to discriminate good from bad--or to recognize what is best
and worst,□vital and unimportant, central and peripheral, significant
and irrelevant,□etc; Anonymity to the world at large or external
confusion and misreaction;□Etc.
□□□□□□□Ideonomy can be used to suggest goals that are□□□□: new,
alternative,□contrasting, successional or progressive, maximal or
optimal, safe, certain,□transcendent or revolutionary, unconsidered or
overlooked, realistic, easy,□expedient, productive, ultimate or
supreme, simpler or more complex, indirect,□contingent, secondary or
tertiary, suited to oneself, complementary to□situations or
circumstances, compatible, synergistic, logical, less
costly,□multidimensional or multipurpose, subtle, definable,
proportionate to one's□resources, unorthodox, contra-intuitive,
irredundant, finite or infinite,□equivalent or analogous, specific or
general, universal, etc.
□□□□Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are not
abandoned□because they have never been made explicit. When some goal is
made explicit□it becomes possible to study its real meaning and
importance and the relationships□it has to other things that are being
done or that might be done. The things□that are required for the goal
to be achieved can be investigated, decided□upon, and implemented.
□□□□Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every
sort□of goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge can be
derived□from this of the larger and more efficient ways and means of
pursuing arbitrary□or all goals. Mistakes that are apt to be made in
selecting and achieving□goals can be identified, along with ways of
avoiding those mistakes or□of dealing with them when they occur.
□□□□□□□Other characteristic problems that are associated with the pursuit□of
goals include□□□□ an overdramatization of the importance of a single□goal,
token attention to the goal, a tendency for a goal to be
misformulated□or misinterpreted, failure to appreciate that a goal is
apt to be more□than a simple name or definition and may embrace the
simple insights that□are apt to accrue in planning for and advancing
toward the goal, the error□of relying upon a single method or path for
achieving the goal, etc.
□□□□□□□Illustrative examples of goals are□□□□: Putting the first men on□the Moon;
Target in an enemy country of an intercontinental ballistic
missile;□Downing and eating of a gazelle as the goal of a lion that is
stalking□it; Student's goal of passing an exam; Finding a needle in a
haystack;□Landing someone as one's spouse; Solving some great unsolved
problem in□mathematics, as by finding a proof of Fermat's last theorem;
Breaking an□Olympic record in poll vaulting; 'Pineapple's goal' of
reaching the standard□size specified by the genome of the pineapple
plant; Zinc atoms' 'goal'□to deposit themselves on the cathode in the
electrolysis of zinc chloride□solution; Break-even point in research to
achieve controlled thermonuclear□fusion for industry; 'Goal' of a
column of magma ascending through Earth's□crust to reach the atmosphere
and erupt lava on the Earth's surface; Goal□of a company to recover its
investment in developing a new product; Puppy's□goal of reaching its
mother's teat while fighting its littermates for the□same objective;
Goal of a detective to discover the identity of a murderer;□'Goal' of
the disturbed surface of a pond to settle back into
hydrostatic□(gravitational) equilibrium; Etc.
□□□□Although the concept of a goal in the realm of inanimate nature is
momentarily□discountenanced, several fundamental questions are in fact
begged by this□exclusion, and--certainly with revision--the concept may
one day be be□resurrected. At the very least it may be decided that the
□□□word□□□□ should□be redefined so that it can function in this more embracive
way, since□dead matter can be observed to behave in ways that □□□by analogy□□□□ suggest□the pursuit and satisfaction of goals by organisms or
minds. The 'goal'□may simply be the thermodynamic end-state of a
physical process that is□relaxing toward equilibrium-regardless of
whether that end-state is known,□specifiable, or even meaningful in
advance, or of whether it is uniquely□implicit in some set of
mathematical equations. It is also true that it□is premature to
absolutely exclude the possibility of teleological phenomena□or of
"final causes" from physical nature. Excluded possibilities in
science□have a funny way of reentering the picture years later in
radically different□dress, although this is a lesson that scientists
have been slow to learn.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Show Paths To Goals□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□It is possible to know, or even to prove, that a goal is
attainable□while at the same time remaining ignorant of how to actually
achieve it.□Even if all of the necessary resources and methods are at
one's disposal,□a critical sequence of steps or concatenation of things
may elude one.□An objective may hover an instant, layer, cell,
operation, or decision□away and yet be impossible to reach simply
because the path to it is not□known, well-defined, or available.
□□□□Ideonomy can teach general and specific ways to discover or create
paths□to specific and generic goals, and train the relevant skills.
□□□□□□□It can also suggest□□□□: Whether a desired or imagined path exists□or not
or would or would not be feasible; Costs and requirements of
finding,□constructing, altering, or using paths; Things paths should
avoid or their□general hazards; Different types of paths that are
possible or appropriate;□Likely and proper quantitative dimensions of
paths; Consequences or side□effects of using different paths; Etc.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Clarify Good□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□To clarify good it may be convenient, desirable, or necessary to
first□or eventually consult, define, investigate, portray, or even
create bad.□Bads and goods are both primary concerns of ideonomy.
□□□□□□□Basic classes of goods are□□□□: Helps and assistance; 'Net goods';□Virtues;
Excellences; Benefits; Advantages; Ideals; Wishes and aims
(desired□things and conditions); Needed and useful resources; Good
luck; Pleasures□and pleasurable things; and 'Non-bads' (absences of
bad; everything that□is not actually bad).
□□□□The goods that interest ideonomy need not have anything to do with
human□beings or human values. Inanimate phenomena and entities--and
'pure ideas',□whatever □□□they□□□□ are--have their own agathokakological
orders. □□□All□□□□□goods of □□□all□□□□ things should be inquired into, systematized,
and reduced□to ever more universal laws.
□□□□How can good be served, maximized, and evolved if we are ignorant
of□its kinds, possibilities, and laws? If we do not understand its
complexities,□problems, contradictions, and illusions? If its elements,
fundamentals,□needs, mechanisms, processes, and manifold relationships
to the other things□of the universe are unknown?
□□□□One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine
the□nature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random or
particular-thing□in an effort to discover all goods of or connected
with the thing, or every□way and degree in which any or every thing is
or is not 'good' for the□thing or 'from the thing's perspective'.
□□□□Were the thing to be given such comprehensive agathological scrutiny□an
ant, for example, one might ask and try to answer these questions:
Is□the presence of a minimum amount of water in the soil important to
the□ant's hive? Which traces of chemical elements are good for the
ant's diet,□□□□even though they are not essential nutrients□□□□? Are there diseases□of other soil organisms that benefit the ant when they occur?
What polymorphisms□are good or best for the species of ant? What wind
velocity at the mouth□of an ant's nest is optimal for the colony, in
good weather? Are there□certain early life experiences that are good
for an ant to have, say because□they trigger the emergence of latent
instincts, orient the ant for life□to the peculiarities of its
environment, or institute certain skills in□the then- plastic nervous
system of the ant?
□□□□Lessons here could be carried over experimentally to the possible
goods□for other animal species. Discrepancies, adaptations, and
supplementations□noted through such series, networks, and hierarchies
of comparisons could□lead to an even more powerful generalization of
agathological knowledge,□methods, and skills, and eventually make
possible the treatment of arbitrary□goods of arbitrary things.
□□□□Another valuable ideonomic exercise would be to construct a
diagram□with the names of a random set of related or maximally diverse
things scattered□about but enclosed in ellipses. Arrows would be drawn
between certain ellipses□to indicate which things are or might be, in
some sense or degree, good□for which other things. □□□Arrows could be□□□□:
one-way or two-way, simple□or branched, connected only to ellipses or
also referent to or from other□arrows (□□□□□□□□□□□ la □□□□vergences, networks,
circuitries, hierarchies,□or other meta- structures), weighted by being
thickened, colored to signify□senses of good or goodness, etc.
□□□□□□□Complementary sets or suites of the diagram could be created to
exhibit□or investigate□□□□ the difference that various arguments,
circumstances,□or perspectives make for the possible or actual
relationships, incremental□but rational and natural changes in various
directions (e.g. that of scaled□time or probability), how different
people would render the same diagram,□etc.
□□□□Such an agathological diagram - or agathogram - could be programmed□on
a computer in a matric or dynamic form. Multivariate analysis,
multidimensional□scaling, cluster analysis, artificial intelligence
techniques and programs,□etc could be used to discover and explore an
agathological universe - or□agathocosm - of : meaningful, contrasting,
interdependent, orthogonal,□nonexistent, evolutionary, anamorphic,
circular, cyclic, autopoietic, mathematically□diverse, arborescent,
stochastic, chaotic, aesthetically appealing, "implicate"□(in David
Bohm's sense), etc : idea spaces, permutations, combinations,□clusters,
chains, series, "rotations", inversions, representations,
games,□systems of motions and transformations, morphogeneses, other
types of ideograms,□etc.
□□□□□□□All of the □□□□: senses, categories, types, subtypes, taxons, and□natural
taxological systems : of □□□special or universal goods need to□be □□□□identified, described, named, evaluated, reduced to operations
and□logic and transformations, etc. □□□They should be used to □□□□: discover,□imagine, investigate, characterize, compare, interrelate,
synthesize, criticize,□perfect, exploit, transcend, teach, etc □□□all
goods of all things.□□□□□□□□□□□□What are all□□□□ known or possible dimensions for scaling goods or□the
goodness of things, and all actual □□□scalings and co-scalings of
all□abstract and concrete goods, e.g. per□□□□: closeness, redundancy,
co-representability□or comparability, orthogonality, oppositeness,
cost, frequency of exemplification,□typological diversity, confinement
to man (anthropomorphism) or contrary□exemplification throughout
nature, human importance, human agreement about,□degree of clustering,
logical containment or hierarchy, universal symmetry,□conceptual
simplicity, etc?
□□□□How does the same type of good vary when it is exemplified in
different□phenomena or sciences?
□□□□What are all of the goods and bads that converge in and/or diverge
from□single events?
□□□□What transvaluations of goods, or of the goodness of things, are
possible,□desirable, or inevitable?
□□□□□□□Some illustrative genera of good are□□□□: order, harmony,
efficiency,□simplicity, reliability, strength, success, improvement,
wealth, balance□or proportion, security, freedom, opportunity, utility,
diversity, transcendence,□wisdom, power, control, productivity,
flourishing, peace, 'health', problemlessness,□salubrity, wholeness,
meaning, challenge, consummation, certainty, purpose,□direction,
preservation, beauty, challenge, responsibility, 'fairness',□good
fortune, cleanliness, clarity, sophistication, assistance,
synergism,□truth, self-mastery, etc.
□□□□All causes of good need to be discovered, defined, distinguished,
quantified,□explained, synthesized, systematized, mastered
(technologically and methodologically),□etc. Yet the causes of both
specific and generic goods are often esoteric.
□□□□□□□Some possible or known causes of good are□□□□: one or more other□goods;
universal laws and relationships; nature's pervasive or absolute□self-
similarity; the subjectivity of 'goods' and the spatiotemporal
invariances□of human minds; striving for good; plans; methods;
cooperative and coevolutionary□tendencies of natural phenomena;
evolution--incl. self- evolution and cosmic□evolution-of things and
goods; the pervasive tendency of the universe to□order and organize
itself; moral and legal laws; the sense of beauty; fractal,□harmonic,
hierarchic, vergent, cyclic, and other meta- patterns and
meta-structures;□man's habits of collecting, preserving, nursing, and
combining goods or□good things; early agathology; etc.
□□□□□□□Some illustrative species or narrow examples of good are□□□□: humility,□honesty, sanity, kindness, reverence, trust, stability,
civilization, good□habits, tolerance, gentleness, magnanimity,

□□□□The ideonomic treatment of good and bad can be pandisciplinary in
□□□two□□□□□senses: not only can ideonomy help to treat the content or
phenomena of□all subjects, but it can at the same time be used to
evaluate, criticize,□and improve the work, organization, and structure
of entire disciplines.
□□□□□□□Thus it could be used to answer the question□□□□: what in the
methods,□research programs, tools, goals, foundations, concepts and
theories, language,□research foci, institutions, pedagogy,
publications, etc of present- day□□□□biology□□□□ is good and bad?
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Help Treat the Hardest Things□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□At any moment in a given field certain problems, tasks, questions,
methods,□phenomena, domains, unmet needs, goals, concepts, subfields,
etc explicitly□or implicitly exist that are the most difficult ones of
all in that field;□and a subset of these things will be the hardest
things in human knowledge□and endeavor as a whole.
□□□□□□□Breakthroughs in these cases are apt to□□□□ cause the greatest
excitement,□have the largest consequences for those fields or for
civilization, shift□paradigms or upend cherished beliefs, reorient or
revolutionize theoretical□or experimental inquiry, initiate new fields
of investigation, conclude□or commence the longest-lived and most
emotional squabbles, etc.
□□□□In an abstract and generic sense the hardest things are apt to be
or□relate to: Demonstrations that a postulated or implied entity or
relationship□exists or does not exist, or is possible or impossible;
Firm proofs or□disproofs of a proposition or hypothesis; Unifications
of an entire field□or theory; Proofs of the equivalence or
nonequivalence of two fundamental□things; Universality of some concept,
law, relation, or phenomenon; Demonstration□that a certain thing is
truly fundamental or more fundamental than anything□else known or
possible; Falsification or modification of what are assumed□to be
universal or absolute laws, constants, theories, etc; Gaining
of□absolute or overriding control over some system, process, or
phenomenon;□Obtaining □□□complete□□□□ knowledge or understanding of a thing;
Advances□involving extremely complex or chaotic phenomena; Matters that
require□breakthroughs in pure or applied logic; Etc.
□□□□□□□For a variety of reasons ideonomy may in the future play an
important□role in the treatment of the hardest things□□□□: It may be a
fallacy that□the hardness of solving certain classes of problems is
fundamental, intrinsic,□and irreducible--and ideonomy may help
challenge this highly influential□fallacy; it may be a fallacy that
there is only one way to solve certain□problems or answer certain
questions--and ideonomy may have a peculiar□power to bring to light the
actual richness of possibilities; One of the□spurs for the creation of
ideonomy in the first place was the attempt to□furnish the human mind
with some universally more powerful instrument in□the treatment of
extreme difficulty and complexity, and in the handling□of the special
problems being created by the explosive growth of human□knowledge,
technology, and endeavor; Unexpected analogies may exist between□the
hardest things in different sciences, the concepts and methods
pertinent□thereto, the importances thereof, and even the basic
solutions to the problems□represented by such things--analogies that
ideonomy can help to reveal□and treat; Ideonomy can be used to
ascertain and dramatize the absolute□and relative need, importance, and
consequences of achieving the hardest□things; Ideonomy can systematize,
coordinate, accelerate, and maximize□the imagination and discovery of
the totality of hardest things; Usually□few people know of the
existence, nature, and implications of the hardest□things, and ideonomy
can make such knowledge more broadly available, both□within the
relevant field and outside it; Etc.
□□□□□□□Some illustrative examples of the hardest things are□□□□: Whether,□in
mathematics, there are fractional alefs, or whether alef one is or
is□not equivalent to the power of the continuum; Nature of measurement
in□quantum theory; Fundamental relationship between quantum and
relativity□physics; How our brain thinks or computers can be made to
think as well□or better; Fundamental relationship between the physical
and mental aspects□of nature; Basic nature of mathematical truth;
Question as to the ultimate□safety of scientific and technological
progress, or of how to insure its□safety; Many- body problems in
mathematical physics; What the essential□nature of life is; Whether
actual infinities exist in nature or nature□is wholly finite and
discrete; Why nature itself exists in the first place;□Extent to which
our picture of nature is reducible to one or a few things□(e.g. laws,
forces, entities, sciences, theories, representations,
phenomena,□relationships, processes, principles, substances, problems,
concepts, etc);□Unification of gravitation with the other known
fundamental physical forces;□Isolation of the fundamental,
quantitative, and predictive laws of society□or of social behavior and
development; Automation of artistic creation;□Creation of a fully
consistent, or comprehensive, theory of probability;□Logical
foundations of physics; Nature of randomness or its contribution□to the
physical world; Scientific basis of ethics; Why physical space
is--or□seems--tridimensional; Structure and dynamics of Dirac's
quantum-mechanical□vacuum; Ergodic theory; Information theory;
Prediction of patterns given□cellular automata will produce, or of the
cellular automata that can generate□desired or noted patterns; Initial
conditions of 'the universe'; Long-term□future of civilization;
Measurement of gravitation's fundamental velocity□or coupling constant
to other basic forces, or detection of gravity waves□or gravitons;
Basic nature of time, or whether reversible travel backwards□and
forwards in time is feasible; How life began, and □□□a priori□□□□□probability□of its origin or repeated origin (around the universe );
Basic structure□of the universe; How to civilize human nature or the
earth--or extinguish□war and crime; How much of the human mind is
inherited from the human genome;□What the quantity of nonsense in the
world is; Etc.
□□□□What are all of the hardest problems and possibilities that are
connected□with a single, random or particular, thing?
□□□□Where would all of the examples of hardest things that were
mentioned□above fall on a universal scale of degrees of hardness? Which
of the things□would be most ambiguous or hard to place on such a scale?
□□□□What hierarchies of hardest things are there? Also what series,
networks,□trees, rings (sic), clusters, etc?
□□□□Which of the things listed above should be tackled first and last
--and□why?
□□□□Are there things that are by definition, or that can be proven in
advance□to be, □□□infinitely□□□□ hard to accomplish or know?
□□□□Where would the examples of hardest things above all fall on a
scale□giving the imagined quantity of future time that will or must
elapse before□that which they speak of becomes known or is achieved?
□□□□What are the basic reasons for the hardness of each of those things?
□□□□Which of those apparent or supposed hardnesses may in fact be
illusory?
□□□□On the other hand, which of all those things that would seem to us
easy□to accomplish or know in the future, may actually turn out to be
hard or□among the hardest of possibilities?
□□□□What were the hardest problems historically and how were they
solved?□Moreover, what resulted from their solution or explanation-and
what lessons□may there be for us now as we confront those things that
for ourselves□are the hardest to come to terms with?
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Describe Hierarchies□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□From the point of view of ideonomy, an infinite number and variety
of□hierarchies may well exist in and as nature, and all things, in some
sense,□may be hierarchical or possess hierarchical aspects, elements,
and relationships.
□□□□The foreseen task is to find and define the totality of such
hierarchies□and hierarchical relationships, to identify the laws
thereof, and to progressively□exploit the opportunities implicit in
such things.
□□□□Of course hierarchy represents □□□just one□□□□ of the basic genera
of□so-called meta-structures that presumably pervade the universe or
'reality',□but the exemplifications, meanings, and possibilities of
each such genus□must be thoroughly investigated and elaborated. The
case of hierarchy can□serve as a general example of what must be done
and of what is apt to follow□upon the doing of it.
□□□□What is meant by the word or concept of hierarchy? One way to
answer□this question is by seeing what hierarchy could mean--or what
hierarchies□may in fact, or could in theory, exist--in connection with
a variety of□things. For example:
□□□□□□□Could there be a hierarchy of snowflakes□□□□? Actually there could□be many
such hierarchies: Presumably there is a probability spectrum
for□different flake shapes; Formative mechanisms may be plural or
subject to□complication or external influences, in which case either
the causes or□their effects may canonically progress in chains and
branch in--chronological□or nomological-- trees; Probability or
existence of certain flake forms□may be a function of the set-theoretic
statistics or combinatorial clustering□of other flake forms; Etc.
□□□□□□□A hierarchy of winters□□□□? Perhaps winters can be
multidimensionally□described and there are certain types of winters
that are only likely to□to occur after, or somewhere in the middle of,
certain sequences of other□types of winters; Perhaps there is a
hierarchy of descriptions or of descriptive□elements, such that certain
descriptions or elements are more fundamental□or at least simpler than
others, and it is appropriate or necessary to□'move along' the
hierarchy in attempting to characterize winters; Etc.
□□□□□□□A hierarchy of stars□□□□? Certain stars generate chemical elements□and
isotopes that are then recycled in other stars and without which
those□other types and generations of stars are impossible; Similar
stellar hierarchy□may exist thanks to the production, recycling,
multistage transformation,□or control of different molecular species by
generations--or perhaps by□synchronic hierarchies--of stars;
Hierarchical sets of stars may create□different physical conditions at
a variety of levels (e.g. of stellar density)□that induce special types
of stars, or of stellar behavior, at those levels;□Etc.
□□□□□□□Possible or actual properties, dimensions, or features of
hierarchies□or of their contents include□□□□: Elements; Sets, subsets, and
supersets;□Levels; Degrees; Layers; Ranges; Intervals; Gaps; Folia;
Partitions; Stages;□Chains or sequences; Series; Harmonics or powers;
Units and multiples;□Domination and subordination; Supreme commander;
Tops, apexes, vertexes,□etc; Bottoms, bases, roots, foundations, etc;
Starts, origins, first things,□a single beginner, etc; Stops, finishes,
last things, etc; Greatest or□maximal thing; Least or minimal things or
thing; Thresholds; Transformations;□Rhythms, cycles, iterations,
reappearances, etc; Poles, orientations, etc;□Inversions; Transitivity;
Asymmetry; Antisymmetry; Control, government,□or regulation; Ranks;
Superiority; One-many relationships; Trees or arborescence;□Direction;
Unidirectional action; Dependences, independences, and
interdependences;□Monotonic progression; Emergence; Equivalent and
nonequivalent elements;□Simplicity; Internal structure and external
form; Completeness and all-□inclusiveness; Horizontal and vertical
relationships; Rules; Defined or□exact relationships; Continuity;
Universality; Pyramidality; Discrete and□continuous aspects; Opposites,
antipolarity, and antisyzygies; Uniqueness□or singularity;
Unity-in-diversity; Spectrums; Convergence, divergence,□and vergence;
Orthogonality; Etc.
□□□□□□□Possible effects, values, or uses of hierarchies include:
□□□□Arbitrarily□large sets of things or elements can be connected, reduced,
related, or□traced back to, or derived from, just a single thing,
element:, point,□event, law, etc.--via a path that is at once □□□maximally□□□□
short, powerful,□comprehensive, logical, necessary, central,
self-similar, ubiquitous, etc;□Causation, perturbation, government, etc
can be shown to be, or treated□as being, completely unidirectional and
an incremental and comprehensive□flow over an arbitrarily large set of
identical or diverse things, processes,□phenomena, domains, effects,
changes, events, etc; Time-asymmetric evolution□of an entire system or
universe; Flows in two opposite and paired directions□can be enabled or
defined--flows of an opposite, complementary, reciprocal,□or
independent nature or content; Things or processes of every
possible□size, number, or complexity can all be 'reduced' to the
dimidiations, doublings,□bifurcations, partitionings, iterations,
recursions, fractal structure,□or the like of a single thing, process,
pattern, or the like--so that the□smallest and largest scales or sets,
first and last things, whole and parts,□e/vc of the hierarchy are
mutually derived, antisyzygially, in an exact□or approximate way;
Generalization, specialization, and their
interdetermination;□Alternative descriptions, classifications, or
treatments of things can□be rigorously excluded; Possibilities can be
constrained; Different and□disjunct trees of possibilities can be
differentiated and selected; Things□can be described or controlled via
the simplest language, code, logic,□or information-theoretic structure;
Operations or actions can be reduced□to uniquely consecutive and finite
decisions; Variables can be treated□as constants, and constants as
variables, at successive 'levels'; Those□degrees of freedom that enable
the self- organization of a phenomenon or□realm can be increased or
maximized; Potential or actual self-interaction,□self-government,
self-connection, autocorrelation, self-description,
complexity,□heterogeneity, proteanness, e/vc of a thing or phenomenon
can be maximized;□Use of resources can be optimized, or need for
resources minimized; Redundancy□can be minimized, irredundancy
maximized (and vice versa, paradoxically);□Etc.
□□□□□□□In a simpler way, hierarchies or hierarchization can serve, i.
a.:□□□□□classification, description, definition, development,
morphogenesis, evolution,□transformation, revolution, generalization,
specialization, integration,□isolation, amplification, analogization,

□□□□Particularly or peculiarly interesting genera of hierarchies in
this□list are in upper case. Many suggest fascinating problems,
questions, and□possibilities--which ideonomy will eventually address.
□□□□Actually many things need to be learned about all of those genera.
□□□Thus□what are all of their□□□□: exemplifications, specializations, causes,
effects,□roles, interrelations and interactions, laws, activities,
structures, transformations,□histories, futures, evolutions and
retrogressions, fine structure, etc?
□□□□Hierarchy can be defined in many different ways. □□□The dictionary
distinguishes□□□□:□(1) The arrangement of objects, elements, or values in a
graduated series;□(2) A series of objects, elements, or values so
arranged; (3) □□□In logic,□□□□□a series the members of which are grouped in
accordance with a principle□(as of importance, perfection, or
priority); (4) The stratification so□achieved; □□□specifically□□□□, a table of
statistical correlations having□a constant proportional relationship
and graded from high to low; (5) A□body of persons or things ranked in
grades, orders, or classes, one above□another; a system or series of
terms of successive rank, used in classification□(as in biology).
□□□□Additionally, of the adjective "hierarchical" it says: (6) Having
the□power to control; influential.
□□□□A more ideonomic characterization of hierarchy: (7) At the top or
upward□is the thing or set of things that controls, dominates,
influences, limits,□expresses, indicates, facilitates, e/vc the
meaning, importance, behavior,□degrees of freedom, changes,
possibilities, relationships, aspects, costs,□needs, outputs, e/vc of
that below or dot-inward.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
