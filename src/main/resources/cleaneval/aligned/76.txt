FOR THEIR ACTS OF BRUTALITY AGAINST NEW AFRIKANS AND OTHA OPPRESSED PEEPOE'-----S?--------  IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY DE OUTCOME OF YEARS OF RESISTANCE BY REVOLUTIONARIES, PROGRESSIVE NORTH AMERIKANS, AND CITIZENS OF OTHA OPPRESSED NATIONS OF KOLOUR; YEARS OF BATTLING NEO-KKKOLONIAL FORCES SO WE COULD HAVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS OR TO SHUT DOWN THESE POLITICAL PRISONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CARRY OUT LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE ON THOSE WITH A RADICAL POLITIC AND DENY EVERYONE THEIR HUMAN-RIGHTS?! CONDITIONS WHICH WERE SO REPRESSIVE AND DEHUMANIZING THAT THEY COMPELLED COMRAD KATAZA TAIFA TO CUT-OF DE TIP OF HIS FINGER AND ATTEMPT TO-MAIL IT TO DE A.C.L.U. IN PROTEST OF DE BARBARISM BEING CARRIED OUT AT M.C.C. AGAINST KAPTIVES?--------  WHAT HAS BECOME OF THOSE CONCERNED MEN WHO MARCHED BY DE HUNDREDS AT I.S.R. IN PROTEST OF DE CONDITIONS AT M.C.C. AND TO SHOW SOLIDARITY FOR THOSE BEING VICTIMIZED THERE? THIS PEACEFUL MARCH AROUND DE WALL AT RECREATION RESULTED IN DE ENTIRE KKKAMP BEING LOCKED DOWN AND DOZENS OF PROGRESSIVE ELEMENTS BEING TRANSFERRED TO OTHA KKKAMPS THRUOUT DE STATE, BUT IT SHOWED WE COULD COME TOGETHER ACROSS RACE, RELIGIONS OR POLITICAL LINES FOR A COMMON PURPOSE - KOMBATING OUR OPPRESSION.--------  WHERE IS DE SPIRIT THAT INVOKED A GROUP OF NEW AFRIKAN FREEDOM FIGHTERS TO SPEAK OUT-AGAINST - WHAT WAS AT THAT TIME - DE UPCOMING LEGAL LYNCHING OF COMRAD BROTHA ZIYON YISRAYAH? THESE SOULJAHS, AFRIKA'-----S GLORIOUS CHILDREN, WOULD LATER BE SNATCHED UP BY RACIST PIGS AND HELD AT GUN POINT WHILE BEING MARCHED OUT OF I.S.P. ON TO BUSES CARRYING THEM TO M.C.C. THESE SOULJAHS WOULD BECOME KNOWN AS DE INDIANA 10, AND LATER, DE INDIANA-----------  THERE ARE SO MANY MORE ACTS OF HEROISM THAT COULD BE MENTIONED HERE - TOO NUMEROUS TO CONVEY IN A BRIEF ARTICLE SUCH AS THIS. AND WHILE I'-----M WELL AWARE THAT I ASKED MORE THAN ONE QUESTION, I FELT IT WAS-NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SHOW DE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR SITUATION.--------  IS DE LOW TIDE IN DE PRISON-STRUGGLE HERE IN INDIANA DUE TO DE----- "FACT-----" THAT WE ARE NOLONGER BEING OPPRESSED OR BRUTALIZED? ARE POLITICALLY ACTIVE PRISONERS NOLONGER BEING KEPT IN TRANSIT OR BEING HELD ON BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION UNITS FOR YEARS AND YEARS FOR NO OTHA REASON THAN-OUR POLITICAL VIEWS?--ARE KAPTIVES NOLONGER BEING MURDERED BY PRISON OFFICIALS?--------!  IF ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE CONTINUING TO BE PERPETUATED AGAINST US, THEN WHY ARE WE FAILING TO ORGANIZE ON A COLLECTIVE AND PRINCIPLED PROTRACTED LEVEL AGAINST THIS MADNESS? I'-----M NOT TALKING ABOUT DE TYPE OF SUPPORT ONES ARE EXTENDING JUST TO GET RECOGNITION FROM A PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF SOCIETY SO THEY CAN-PARADE AROUND AS LEGITIMATE ALLIES OF DE OPPRESSED. THEY ENGAGE IN DE STRUGGLE FOR 30 DAYS, THEN YOU DON'-----T HEAR FROM THEM NO MORE-----! "PROTRACTED-----" MEANS ON GOING! OUR OPPRESSION IS PROTRACTED, THUS OUR RESISTANCE TOO MUST BE PROTRACTED--------!  NOW IS DEFINITELY NOT DE TIME TO BECOME PASSIVE OR SILENT. KAPTIVES, LIKE GREG GOODWIN AT I.S.P., ARE BEING MURDERED BY PRISON EMPLOYEES. DE STATE IS INSTITUTING PHONE POLICIES DESIGNED TO FURTHER RESTRICT AND MONITOR DE COMMUNICATION WE HAVE WITH DE OUTSIDE WORLD. RACIST POLICIES SUCH AS----- "ZERO TOLERANCE ON GANGS-----" ARE BEING USED TO TERRORIZE NEW AFRIKANS - POLITICAL CONSCIOUS AND KAPTURED CITIZENS - AND STRIP US OF OUR SO-CALLED GOOD-TIME, AND ISOLATE AND NEUTRALIZE US. OTHA OPPRESSIVE POLICIES INCLUDE DE NEW DRUG POLICY WHICH IF A KAPTIVE FAILS A URINE TEST OR IS CAUGHT WITH ANY DRUG OR TOBACCO PARAPHERNALIA, THEY COULD LOOSE THEIR VISITS AS WELL AS THEIR SO-CALLED GOOD-TIME. UNDOUBTED THIS WILL BECOME A TOOL USED TO EXCOMMUNICATE PP'-----S/POW'-----S FROM DE OUTSIDE WORLD BY FALSELY ACCUSING POLITICAL ACTIVIST OF DRUG ABUSE, OR PLANTING THESE SUBSTANCE IN HIS ASSIGNED KKKAGE BY PIGS OR THEIR STOOL PIGEONS. PRISONS ARE BEING PRIVATIZED AND NOT ONLY ARE KAPTIVES BEING FORCED TO WORK FOR SLAVE WAGES, BUT THEY ARE ALSO BEING DEMANDED TO PAY RENT--------!!!  DE MAIN PURPOSE OF REVISITING-DE PAST IS SO WE CAN-CRITICALLY ASSESS DE-FAILURES AND-ACHIEVEMENTS OF THOSE BEFORE US (AND DE SITUATION FIVE MINUTES AGO FOR THAT MATTER, FOR IT'-----S ALL DE PAST), AND BASED UPON THAT KNOWLEDGE, ARRIVE AT A CONCRETE OVERSTANDING OF OUR PRESENT CONDITIONS AND DEVELOP CONCRETE SOLUTIONS FOR TOMORROW. WE MUST BUILD INSIDE ORGANIZATION AND-OUTSIDE PRISON ORGANIZATION ON THIS INDIANA PLANTATION THAT IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. THAT WILL CHALLENGE THESE REPRESSIVE POLICIES, AND INDEED DE LEGITIMACY OF THESE KKKONCENTRATION KKKAMPS AND DE OVERALL SYSTEM OF DOMINATION.--------  WE HAVE TO TEACH THIS NEW GENERATION OF----- "REBELS-----" ENTERING DE INDIANA PRISON SYSTEM, ABOUT DE STRUGGLES AND SACRIFICES SOULJAHS HAVE MADE. TEACH THEM ABOUT BALAGOON, SHAKA SHAKUR, TAIFA, KALONJI, AND SO, SO MANY OTHAS! THIS WILL INSTILL IN THEM A GREATER APPRECIATION OF DE CULTURE OF REVOLUTIONARY NATIONALISM, AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRE THEM INTO BECOME CADRE. BUT REMEMBER, WE CAN'-----T INSPIRE THEM TO DO NOTHING-THAT WE AINT DOING. THEREFORE WE MUST MOVE BEYOND DE RHETORIC--------!  IF WE-FAIL TO PASS ON DE TORCH TO DE NEXT GENERATION, WE WILL BE SINGING DE SAME SAD-SONG THAT DE OLD MAN-SANG TO DE TRAVELER...-----"THEY LOST THEIR HISTORY, SO THEY DIED-----"! AND WE WILL HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT OURSELVES.----------~ FROM ONE GENERATION TO DE NEXT----  LESS WE FORGET----! ~  MANGWIRO A. SADIKI----  NARN------------------------------------------------------------------   WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH---WITHOUT YOU----------------!  BY ABDUL-SHAHEED MUSLIM--------- WHEN I FIRST CAME TO PRISON, I-LEARNED ABOUT THE STRUGGLES AND SACRIFICES THAT WERE MADE BY PRISONERS, TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE, BEFORE I EVEN ARRIVED. WHILE IN PRISON I HAVE MET, AND PARTICIPATED WITH, THE PRISONERS WHO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND SACRIFICE FOR CHANGE. OVER THE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN POSITIVE CHANGES. HOWEVER, WITH EVERY POSITIVE CHANGE, THE DOC DOES THAT MUCH MORE TO MAKE THINGS WORST.--------- THERE IS MUCH CHANGE THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE MADE. THAT MEANS THERE IS STILL MUCH STRUGGLE AND SACRIFICE AHEAD.--------  WE ALL KNOW THAT PRISONS ARE ONE OF MANY BATTLEFIELDS IN THE LARGER STRUGGLE FOR TRUE FREEDOM. WE PRISONERS CAN STRUGGLE EACH AND EVERY MOMENT, BUT THE FACT REMAINS WE CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE HAVE TO HAVE OUTSIDE SUPPORT - AND THIS SUPPORT MUST BE CONTINUOUS. TRUE, WE HAVE SOME SUPPORT, BUT, LET'-----S BE HONEST - IT IS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE, NOR ARE THE VARIOUS SUPPORTERS UNITED AS THEY SHOULD BE.--------- THE PRISONERS, AS WELL AS THE SUPPORTERS, NEED TO PUT ASIDE THE PETTY DIFFERENCES THAT ARE KEEPING US DIVIDED - THUS, NOT ALLOWING A RESULT OF CONTINUOUS CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. LET US NOT FOOL OURSELVES, WE ARE BEING WATCHED. WE PRISONERS KNOW HOW WE ARE BEING WATCHED - AND THE SUPPORT GROUPS/INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO BEING-WATCHED, BE IT OVER THE INTERNET OR THROUGH VARIOUS OTHER-COINTELPRO METHODS. THEY ARE SITTING BACK AND SAYING,----- "THEY CANNOT EVEN UNITE AMONGST THEMSELVES, SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO FEAR OF THEM?--------------" WHEN M.C.C., IN WESTVILLE, IN, FIRST OPENED, PRISONERS WERE BEATEN, CHAINED TO BEDS, GASSED, ETC. BECAUSE OF THEIR STRIVING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF-UNORGANIZED OUTSIDE SUPPORT. MANY OF THESE-WERE NEWLY FORMED GROUPS THAT CAME TO BE BECAUSE OF M.C.C., MANY OF THE----- "BIG-----", WELL KNOWN, GROUPS WERE NOT REALLY (BETTER READ TRULY) INTERESTED IN BEING INVOLVED. HOWEVER, WHEN PRISONERS STARTED STARVING THEMSELVES AND A PRISONER CUT OFF HIS FINGER TIP, AND M.C.C. STARTED GETTING NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION - THEN ALL KIND OF GROUPS WANTED-TO SUPPORT THE PRISONERS.--------  DOES ALL OF THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN AGAIN, BEFORE THE PRISONERS ON THE G.-A.S., S.H.U. AND VARIOUS OTHER CONTROL UNITS, GET THE SUPPORT - A UNIFIED SUPPORT - THEY DESERVE?--------  RIGHT NOW I HAPPEN TO BE ON THE G.-A.S. UNIT, AND MUCH NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THE PRISONERS ON THE UNIT. SO, I WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THE G.E.D. OR GET SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ANGER MANAGEMENT HELP. THESE ARE THINGS PRISONERS MUST HAVE TO REGAIN----- "LOST GOOD TIME-----" OR RECEIVE EVEN A CHANCE OF A SENTENCE REDUCTION IN COURT. THE PRISONERS RECEIVE BOGUS CONDUCT REPORTS, ARE HARASSED BY THE GUARDS AND DENIED MOST OF THE RIGHTS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE: WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE HOUR OF RECREATION DAILY, BUT MOST TIMES WE ONLY-GET 20-45 MINUTES (USUALLY 20-30 MINS.). IT DEPENDS ON WHICH GUARDS ARE WORKING THAT DAY. THEY LITERALLY TELL YOU,----- "SO WHAT, FILE A GRIEVANCE.-----" MOST GRIEVANCES ARE NEVER RETURNED OR RULED ON! WE'-----VE EVEN HAD A GUARD GO SO FAR AS TO TELL US,----- "WE USE THE GRIEVANCES TO WIPE OUR ASSES WITH.-----" (WELL... IF SO, I HOPE THEY GET SOME PAPER CUTS ON THEIR REAREND AND THE INK CAUSES AN INFECTION). I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE THINGS OCCURRING ON THIS UNIT, BUT IT WOULD TAKE UP PAGES OF THIS NEWSLETTER, SO I WILL MOVE ON.--------  BEATINGS OF PRISONERS BY GUARDS IS A MAJOR AND GROWING PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF INDIANA, ESPECIALLY ON THE CONTROL UNITS OF SHU, NSB, DS, MSU, MCC AND D-CELL HOUSE.--------  MANY OF THE PRISONERS BEING BEATEN ARE THE MENTALLY ILL AND POLITICAL PRISONERS (MANY ARE HARASSED AND SINGLED OUT FOR PHYSICAL ASSAULT BECAUSE OF THEIR FILING COMPLAINTS AND LITIGATION AGAINST PRISON OFFICIALS AND GUARDS). OUR LIVES HERE IN INDIANA DOC ARE NOT SAFE DUE TO THE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BRUTALITY WE MUST FACE DAILY.--------  WE ARE FED UP WITH THIS INJUSTICE. ARE YOU? WE CALL UPON YOU, THE PEOPLE, TO BE REAL WITH US AND WITH YOURSELVES. PLEASE CONTACT THE PRISONERS WHO WRITE IN THIS NEWSLETTER FOR MORE DETAILED INFO-ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING ON THE UNITS THEY LIVE IN.-CONTINUOUSLY CONTACT THE-ELECTED LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS, THE GOVERNOR, MEMBERS OF THE NEWS MEDIA AND THE INDIANA DOC-AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GROSS LACK OF REGARD FOR OUR RIGHTS AS HUMAN BEINGS - AND THAT YOU WILL NOT STAND FOR IT (THEN, ONCE YOU-DO THIS, PLEASE DO NOT STAND FOR IT!) HELP US EXPOSE THE WRONGS, THE CONDITIONS, THE RACISM AND THE BRUTALITY AGAINST PRISONERS IN THE INDIANA DOC - AND DEMAND THAT AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION IS INITIATED INTO THE BEATINGS AND ASSAULTS (PAST-AND PRESENT) OF PRISONERS BY GUARDS (I KNOW OF THESE PERSONALLY, I-HAVE THE SCARS TO SHOW-IT DOES OCCUR).--------  WE CALL UPON YOU TO ASSIST AND-HELP US NOW - NOT AFTER-A PRISONER HAS BEEN RESORTED TO STARVING HIMSELF, CUTTING OFF A FINGER (OR BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH BY-GUARDS, WHICH WILL OCCUR EVENTUALLY - AGAIN), BECAUSE THEY NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.--------  WE PRISONERS CONTINUE TO-LOOK BACK AT YESTERDAY - AND SEEING TOMORROW. WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? PLEASE SUPPORT PRISONERS. WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH - WITHOUT YOU--------!

F.U.--------  IT'-----S BEEN (50) YEARS SINCE THE U.S HAS WENT TO EUROPE + BUTCHERED OTHER EUROPEANS (NOTE: THE LAST BEING NAZI-OCCUPIED GERMANY). IRONICALLY THE U.S. GOT INVOLVED IN WORLD WAR II FOR THE SAME REASON WHY THEY'-----VE GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH KOSOVO. IT WAS O.K. FOR THE DEMON HITLER TO HIT NEIGHBORING FRONTS LIKE POLAND, DENMARK, ITALY AND EVEN FRANCE. BUT, ONCE HE'-----D STARTED TO HIT BRITAIN WITH----- "FLY-BY'-----S-----" IT HAD BECOME A WHOLE OTHER STORY. IT WAS O.K. FOR HITLER'-----S GOVERNMENT TO BUTCHER MILLIONS OF SO-CALLED----- "UNDESIRABLES-----" IN GERMANY WHILE STILL TRADING WITH THE U.S DICTATORS. BUT, ONCE HE'-----D BEGAN TO BOMB + BUTCHER BRITAIN/ENGLAND, AGAIN, IT HAD BECOME A WHOLE OTHER STORY. THE U.S. FELT THAT IT'-----S MAD-BROTHER HITLER HAD MADE A VIOLATABLE MOVE BY POUNDING ON THE----- "MOTHER LAND-----" OF THE PIRATES, PILGRIMS, + SETTLERS WHO'-----D STOLEN THE LAND FROM THE NATIVES 400-ODD YEARS AGO IN WHAT'-----S NOW CALLED----- "AMERICA-----". THESE----- "OUTCASTS-----" WERE CONSIDERED THE SCUM OF ENGLAND, YET IT DIDN'-----T TAKE AWAY THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE EURO-SETTLER IN THE U.S. IS A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF ENGLAND/BRITAIN. THUS; HITLER HAD VIOLATED BY----- "SLAPPING-----" THE U.S. DICTATORS MOTHER (I.E. BRITAIN/ENGLAND). THUS; HE HAD TO BE DEALT WITH AND HE WAS. BESIDES THIS; THE U.S. FELT THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR TWO WORLD RULERS. SO, AGAIN; HE HAD TO BE DEALT WITH.--------  NOW; IN 1999 WE HAVE----- "MILOSEVIC-----". AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'-----S ALL FOR TAKING OUT ANY ETHNIC GROUP IN HIS REGION WHO'-----S EITHER OF TURKISH DESCENT, ISLAMIC IN WAY OF LIFE, OR BOTH. USING THE INVASION OF THE TURKISH (TURKEY) EMPIRE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO AS HIS EXCUSE FOR BUTCHERING NOT ONLY THE MEN, BUT BABIES, WOMEN, + ELDERS. THREE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE TARGETS IN ANY WAR. GIVING HIS TROOPS THE O.K. TO CROSS OVER TO NEIGHBORING REGIONS + TAKING OVER. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?--------  THE U.S. GOT INVOLVED NOT BECAUSE IT CARED ABOUT THE REFUGEES. FOR OVER (4) YEARS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IGNORED THE BUTCHERING OF REFUGEES IN THAT REGION BY MILOSOVIC. QUESTION: SINCE WHEN HAS THE U.S GOVERNMENT CARED ABOUT MUSLIMS BEING BUTCHERED? ANSWER: NEVER! SO, WHY NOW?--------  BECAUSE THE MASSACRE HAD GOTTEN TOO WIDE SPREAD + OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE WERE BEGINNING TO RECEIVE SOME----- "DISTURBING-----" NEWS ABOUT KOSOVO. THIS WAS BOUND TO----- "LEAK OUT-----" DUE TO HOW EVEN THE MOST POOREST REGIONS IN EUROPE WERE/ARE ALLOWED TO PLUG INTO THE MEDIA SATELLITES THAT'-----S GOVERNED BY THE U.S. + BRITAIN. UNLIKE REGIONS OF-COLOR WHO ARE BARELY ALLOWED TO PLUG INTO SUCH MEDIA-SATELLITES, LET ALONE LAUNCH THEIR OWN MEDIA-SATELLITES INTO SPACE. THE U.S HAD BEGUN TO SEE THAT SLOWLY BUT SURELY MILOSEVIC'-----S GOVERNMENT WAS MOVING CLOSER + CLOSER TOWARDS OTHER EUROPEAN REGIONS. THUS; CAUSING MORE THAN JUST----- "LOCAL-----" STRIFE IN THAT REGION. THE SO-CALLED PRESIDENT/REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U.S. HAD MADE IT CLEAR DURING HIS NATIONAL ADDRESS ON THE DAY BEFORE HE'-----S GIVEN HIS TRAINED BUTCHERS/MILITARY THE O.K. TO LAUNCH A BOMBING CAMPAIGN ON KOSOVO, THAT THE U.S. WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AN----- "UNITED EUROPE-----" + THAT MILOSEVIC WAS DIVIDING THE EUROPEANS HOUSE. NOW LET'-----S TRY TO DRAW OUT SOME WISDOM FROM THESE WORDS.--------  FOR THE PAST (50) YEARS EUROPE AS A WHOLE HAS BEEN----- "MAJOR CONFLICT-----" FREE. UNTIL RECENTLY WITH THE KONTRADICTION IN BOSNIA---- & KOSOVO. FOR THE PAST (50) YEARS THE U.S., BRITAIN, GERMANY, FRANCE, + RUSSIA HAVE BEEN FUELING INTERNAL CONFLICTS IN REGIONS OF COLOR (I.E. KOREA, AFRIKA, MEXICO, VIETNAM, GRENADA, PANAMA, PALESTINE, IRAQ, IRAN, KUBA, PERU, HAWAII, JAPAN, CHINA, ETC.). CAUSING BROTHER/SISTER TO TURN ON THEIR OWN IMAGE/PEOPLE. DISMANTLING WHOLE TRIBES IN THE RAIN FORESTS. SLAVE LABOR IN INDONESIA. FORCED STERILIZATION OF WOMEN OF COLOR OR THEY'-----LL RECEIVE NO WORK IN THE NIKE FACTORIES, ETC. CAUSING MISCHIEF FROM ONE CORNER OF OUR PLANET TO THE NEXT. WHILE MOST OF EUROPE FELT + ACTED LIKE IT WAS----- "SAFE-----" + WAR FREE.--------  NOW THAT MILOSEVIC'-----S TESTED HIS LONG ARM TACTIC, THREATENING THE----- "STABLENESS-----" OF EUROPE; HE MUST BE DEALT WITH. BECAUSE IT'-----S HARD (TOO HARD) FOR THE U.S.---- & BRITAIN IN PARTICULAR TO FOCUS BOTH ON DICTATING + CAUSING MISCHIEF IN REGIONS OF COLOR WHILE THEIR FOREPARENTS LANDS (EUROPE) DISMANTLING. THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR THE MISCHIEF MAKERS (I.E. U.S., BRITAIN, FRANCE, ETC.)...--------  SO NOW WE'-----VE GOT REACTIONARY NATIONS DROPPING BOMBS + GUIDING/MISGUIDING MISSILES ALL OVER EUROPE (NOTE: WHILE STILL DOING FLY-BY'-----S DAILY ON IRAQ). AS OF TODAY (JUNE 13, 1999) NATO GROUND BUTCHERS ARE MARCHING THRU KOSOVO. THIS IS A PART OF THE SO-CALLED CEASE FIRE AGREEMENT THAT MILOSEVIC SUPPOSEDLY AGREED TO. ALREADY SERB TROOPS HAVE EXCHANGED FIRE WITH NATO GROUND TROOPS. AND RUSSIA'-----S GROUND TROOPS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF BLOCKING OFF THE NATO TROOPS WITH THEIR TANKS. QUESTION: WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME U.S. MILITARY TROOPS HAVE MET----- "FACE TO FACE-----" ON THE BATTLE FIELD WITH RUSSIA'-----S ARMY? ANSWER: NEVER! BOTH NATIONS ARE USED TO SUPPLYING OTHER REGIONS WITH WEAPONS TO FIGHT IN THEIR NAME. BUT NEVER HAVE THE (2) ACTUALLY MET FACE TO FACE ON A BATTLE FIELD. FINALLY----- "THE EAGLE MEETS THE BEAR-----". THIS SO-CALLED----- "AGREEMENT-----" IS JUST THE NEXT STAGE THAT'-----S BEING SET FOR YET SOME MORE KONTRADICTIONS. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TAKING A DEEP SIGH OF RELIEF DUE TO THE SO-CALLED AGREEMENT, DON'-----T BECOME TOO LAXED. BECAUSE WE'-----RE DEALING WITH-MASTERS OF TRICKNOMETRY. THE SMOKING GLASS + MIRROR ILLUSIONISTS. THE NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'-----T MASTERS. DAVID COPPERFIELD'-----S A MERE BABY TO WHAT WE'-----RE DEALING WITH. BUT, SIGN'-----S AND SYMBOL'-----S ARE FOR THE CONSCIOUS/AWARE MIND. FOR THE NODDER/SLEEPER WILL SURELY MISS-THE MARK. JUST A THOUGHT.--------  - PEACE BE UNTO YOU ALL---- -  ONE LUV----!

THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS ADDRESSED THIS TOPIC SINCE 1974 AND THESE DECISIONS ARE THE LANDMARKS BY WHICH THE STATES MUST SET THEIR POLICIES AND REGULATIONS. THE STATE CANNOT MAKE ANY LAWS THAT----- "LEGALLY-----" TAKE PRECEDENT OVER-THESE FEDERAL RULINGS.--------  THOSE-OF US PREPARED TO CHALLENGE-THIS BOLDNESS BY THE-STATE OF INDIANA NEED ONLY ARM OURSELVES-WITH THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WHICH CLEARLY SUPPORT OUR-POSITION AND THEN LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY.--------  ALSO, IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE STATE OF INDIANA'S ATTEMPT TO LITERALLY SMOTHER THE VOICES OF THOSE OF US HELD CAPTIVE, EXTENDS TO THOSE WE CORRESPOND WITH-IN THE----- "FREE-----", WORLD. THIS ATTEMPT ALSO VIOLATES INDIANA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE ONE, SECTION 9, 11, 15 AND------------  ATTACHED, I HAVE PREPARED A SHORT DOCUMENT REGARDING THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PRISONER FIRST AMENDMENT AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM--------  THE WELLSPRING OF FIRST AMENDMENT LAW REGARDING PRISONERS' LEGAL MAIL CAN BE FOUND IN A 1974 UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION (PROCUNIER V. MARTINEZ, 416 U.S.---6 94 S.CT. 1800 (197-)).--------  IN THIS CASE, THE COURT UPHELD CENSORSHIP OF PRISONERS, MAIL IF TWO CRITERIA WERE MET:--------  FIRST, THE PRACTICE IN QUESTION MUST FURTHER AN IMPORTANT AND SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST--- UNRELATED TO THE SUPPRESSION OF EXPRESSION----. PRISON OFFICIALS MUST SHOW THAT A REGULATION AUTHORIZING MAIL CENSORSHIP-FURTHERS ONE OR MORE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL GOVERNMENTAL INTERESTS OF SECURITY, ORDER AND REHABILITATION.--------  SECOND, THE LIMITATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT FREEDOMS MUST BE NO GREATER THAN IS NECESSARY OR ESSENTIAL TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PARTICULAR GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST INVOLVED, I.E. SECURITY, ORDER AND REHABILITATION.--------  THE CASE OF MARTINEZ WAS CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AGAIN IN------ (BELL V. WOLFISH, 441F U.S. 520, 99 S.CT. 1861 (1979)).--------  IN THIS CASE THE COURT APPROVED A----- "PUBLISHERS ONLY-----" RULE THAT PROHIBITED PRISONERS FROM RECEIVING HARDCOVER BOOKS FROM ANY SOURCE OTHER THAN PUBLISHERS, BOOK CLUBS, AND BOOK STORES.--------  EIGHT YEARS LATER, 1987, THE SUPREME COURT CONSIDERED MARTINEZ AGAIN. (TURNER V. SAFLEY, 482 U.S.---, 89, 107 S.CT. 2254, 2261 (1987)).--------  IN THIS CASE, THE COURT HELD THAT-A PRISON REGULATION THAT IMPINGES ON PRISONERS, RIGHTS IS VALID IF IT IS----- "REASONABLY RELATED TO LEGITIMATE PENOLOGICAL INTERESTS-----".--------  THE COURT BACKED OFF THE LANGUAGE IN MARTINEZ, THE TURNER COURT LISTED FOUR FACTORS BY WHICH TO ASSESS A REGULATION'S REASONABLENESS: 1) THE EXISTENCE OF A VALID, RATIONAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE REGULATION AND THE INTEREST USED TO JUSTIFY IT; 2) THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER METHODS BY WHICH PRISONERS CAN EXERCISE THE ASSERTED RIGHT; 3) THE IMPACT ON PRISONERS, AND PRISON RESOURCES IN GENERAL, IF THE RIGHT IS ACCOMMODATED; AND 4) THE ABSENCE OF READY ALTERNATIVES TO THE REGULATION.--------  THE SUPREME COURT AGAIN RETURNED TO THE TOPIC OF PRISONER CORRESPONDENCE IN------ (THORNBURGH V. ABBOTT, 49 U.S. 413, 19 S.CT. 1874 (1989)). THIS WAS, IN SHORT, A RETURN TO 1974 AND MARTINEZ.--------  THIS COURT CAREFULLY NOTED THAT MARTINEZ DID NOT ANNOUNCE A----- "LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS-----" TEST FOR PRISONER MAIL, BUT THE ANALYTICAL POINT MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE MARTINEZ DECISION WAS THAT THE EARLIER DELISION HAD DEALT WITH OUTGOING MAIL, WHILE--- THORNBURGH INVOLVED INCOMING MAIL----.--------  WITH REGARD TO OUTGOING MAIL, THE COURT OBSERVED:----- "DANGEROUS OUTGOING CORRESPONDENCE IS MORE LIKELY TO FALL WITHIN READILY IDENTIFIABLE CATEGORIES: EXAMPLES NOTED IN MARTINEZ INCLUDE ESCAPE PLANS, PLANS RELATING TO ONGOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, AND THREATS OF BLACKMAIL OR EXTORTION.-------------"  THE COURT THEN SEEMED TO REESTABLISH THE MARTINEZ STANDARD FOR OUTGOING MAIL WHILE LIMITING THE TURNER STANDARD (1987), TO INCOMING MAIL. THE COURT MAKES THIS CLEAR WHEN THEY WRITE,----- "AS WE DO NOT HERE APPLY THE MARTINEZ STANDARD,-----"; THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE EARLIER STANDARD, AS NOW CLARIFIED,--- DOES NOT APPLY IN CASES OF INCOMING MAIL SUCH AS TURNER, BUT STILL RETAINS VITALITY. THAT VITALITY CAN ONLY BE WITH REFERENCE TO OUTGOING MAIL.------------  STILL, THE STANDARD FOR ASSESSING INTERFERENCE WITH PRISONERS' OUTGOING MAIL IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR (E.G. UNITED STATES V. WORKMAN, 80 F.3D 688, 698-99 (2ND. CIR. 1996)). (-----"WHERE GOOD CAUSE IS SHOWN, OUTGOING MAIL CAN BE READ WITHOUT VIOLATING PRISONERS' FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS-----", NOTING THAT----- "TURNER ... IS CONSIDERABLY MORE DEFERENTIAL TO RESTRAINTS IMPOSED BY PRISON OFFICIALS ON PRISONER RIGHTS THAN THE STANDARD OF MARTINEZ-----")----------------  B---------. THE DUE PROCESS CLAIM--------  THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DEALT WITH THIS TOPIC IN 1981 AND AGAIN IN------ THE COURT MADE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS CLEAR (PARRATT V. TAYLOR, 451 U.S. 527 101 S.CT. 1908 (1981) AND HUDSON V. PAIMER, 468 U.S. 517, 531, 104 S. ET. 3194, 3203 (1984)). THE COURT HELD:-----------------------  THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT IS VIOLATED WHEN A STATE EMPLOYEE DEPRIVES AN INDIVIDUAL OF PROPERTY, WITHOUT MAKING AVAILABLE A MEANINGFUL POST DEPRIVATION REMEDY.-----------------------------------------------------------   IT'-----S NOW OR NEVER----------------  BY HERMAN AVERHART-BEY--------  TODAY JUST AS WAS THE CASE THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FIRST EMERGED, THE NEW AFRICAN (BLACK) COMMUNITIES REMAIN COLONIZED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CONTROLLED FROM THE OUTSIDE BY THE CAPITALIST BOURGEOISIE WHO IN TURN USE NEW AFRIKAN (BLACK) COLLABORATORS, PETIT-BOURGEOISIE, OPPORTUNISTS, AND DOMESTIC NEO-COLONIALISTS TO CONTROL THE COMMUNITIES FROM THE INSIDE WITH THEIR PACIFICATION PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MISLEAD THE OPPRESSED IN THE INTEREST OF IMPERIALIST HEGEMONY. THESE IMPERIALIST LACKIES, REFORMISTS, AND REVISIONISTS ARE ENEMIES OF THE OPPRESSED MASSES AND MUST BE STOPPED AT ALL COSTS AND BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THE COLONIZED AND EXPLOITED MASSES TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF NEO-SLAVERY.--------  BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THE NEW AFRIKAN (BLACK) LIBERATION STRUGGLE, THE LUMPEN AND LUMPEN PROLETARIAT MUST BREAK WITH PARASITISM, BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE. THERE ARE MANY CONSCIOUS REVOLUTIONARIES AND THOSE PROCLAIMING LEADERSHIP AND ELITISM THAT MUST ALSO BREAK FROM THE CHAINS OF PARASITISM, WHICH MEANS DISUNITY WITH ANY AND EVERYONE THAT CAN'T,-WON'T, OR REFUSE TO BREAK WITH PARASITISM, AND THIS TOO MUST BE DONE BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.--------  IN THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THE ELITIST MENTALITY. THERE ARE NO BIG I'S AND LITTLE U'S. THERE IS NO BETTER THAN THE NEXT. THERE IS ONLY CONSCIOUS, QUASI-CONSCIOUS, AND UNCONSCIOUS. THERE IS ONLY TEACHER AND STUDENT (AND WE ARE ALL BOTH TEACHER AND STUDENT). THERE IS ONLY THE REVOLUTIONARY AND COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY. IN THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION, WE ARE ALL OPPRESSED AND COLONIZED PEOPLE JUST THE SAME, AND AS LUMPEN AND LUMPEN PROLETARIAT WE HAVE A COMMON ENEMY IN CAPITALISM, IMPERIALISM, FASCISM, ZIONISM, RACISM, EXPLOITATION, GENOCIDE, AND OPPRESSION (I.E.-CLASS, RACE, SEX. GENDER, AND RELIGION). SO HOW CAN ANYONE HAVE AN ELITIST MENTALITY? ONLY THOSE CHAINED TO PARASITISM ENTERTAIN OR CONSIDER THE THOUGHT OF THE ELITIST MENTALITY, WHICH GOES TO MAKE ANY SUCH PERSON NO MORE THAN OPPORTUNIST AND COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY.--------  AS WE DRAW NEARER TO THE YEAR 2000 AND THE NEXT MILLENNIUM IN THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION AND SELF-DETERMINATION, THE OPPRESSED AND EX- PLOITED MASSES WITHIN THE COLONIZED COMMUNITIES OF IMPERIALIST AMERIKKKA ARE CONTINUOUSLY BEING TERRORIZED, BRUTALIZED, AND MURDERED DAILY BY THE FASCIST, PATROLLING, COLONIAL OCCUPATIONAL PERSONNEL (COPS) AND RACISTS. THE CAPITALIST BOURGEOISIE STILL CONTROL THE POLITICS AND ECONOMICS OF OUR COMMUNITIES BY WAY OF THE NEW AFRIKAN (BLACK) COLLABORATORS, PETIT-BOURGEOISIE, OPPORTUNISTS, AND DOMESTIC NEO-COLONIALISTS WHO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE RACIST, EXPLOITING, AND IMPERIALISTIC CLIQUES OF SETTLERISTIC AMERICA. THIS EURO-AMERIKAN SETTLERISTIC NATION OF AMERIKKKA IS THE FOUNDATION AND HOME BASE OF CAPITALISM AND IMPERIALISM, AND LEADS THE WORLD IN ACTS OF TERRORISM, EXPLOITATION, AND GENOCIDE, AND MUST BE SMASHED BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.--------  THE LUMPEN AND LUMPEN PROLETARIAT OF THE COLONIZED CONSCIOUS LEFT, BY BEING COLONIZED WITHIN THE BELLY OF CAPITALISM AND IMPERIALISM, ARE IN THE BEST OF STRATEGIC POSITIONS, MORE THAN ANY OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE, TO STRIKE A CRUCIAL AND SHATTERING BLOW TO THE VERY HEART AND SOUL OF CAPITALISM AND IMPERIALISM. AS LONG AS CAPITALISM AND IMPERIALISM ARE ALLOWED TO GO UNCHECKED FROM WITHIN ITS AMERIKKKAN BASE, IT CONTINUES GETTING STRONGER AS IT CONQUERS MORE OF THE WORLD'S TERRITORY AND PRACTICES GENOCIDE ON MORE OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE, WHILE THOSE OF THE CONSCIOUS LEFT WITHIN THE VERY BORDERS OF IMPERIALIST AMERIKKA WATCH IT CARRY OUT ITS POLICIES OF MASSIVE DE- STRUCTION.--------  IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO STOP FOOLING OURSELVES AND PROLONGING THE INELUCTABLE CONCLUSION. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE IS A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE, BUT IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE NEW AFRIKAN (BLACK) LIBERATION STRUGGLE HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE FIRST SLAVE WAS KIDNAPPED. AND AS WE ENGAGE IN OUR OVER-EXTENDED, PROTRACTED STRUGGLE, WE, AS A NEW AFRIKAN (BLACK) PEOPLE, ARE BEING IMPRISONED AND PLACED ON DEATH ROWS BY THE THOUSANDS AND MURDERED IN OUR HOMES AND IN THE STREETS OF IMPERIALIST AMERIKKKA. THE TIME HAS COME TO INTENSIFY THE NATIONAL AN INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE WITHIN THE BORDERS OF IMPERIALIST SETTLERISTIC AMERIKKKA. WHAT THE PANTHERS DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THEY SET A STANDARD THAT YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WANT TO MEASURE UP TO--IT'S A STANDARD OF AG- GRESSIVENESS, OF MILITANCE, OF JUST FORCEFULNESS, THE SORT OF STANDARD WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THE PAST. OUR IDOLS HAVE BEEN DR. KING WHO, FOR ALL OF HIS BEAUTY AS A MAN WAS NOT AN AGGRESSIVE MAN, BUT THE PANTHERS AND I THINK MALCOLM X, HAVE SET THIS NEW KIND OF STANDARD THAT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WANT TO ADHERE TO. ~ JULIAN BOND, APRIL-------- 1970  ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE--------!

MONEY AND SLAVE LABOR, AFTER A CAPTIVE PERSON HAS BEEN DULY CONVICTED AND SENTENCED IN A COURT OF LAW, IS AT THE ROOT OF THIS FOUL BUSINESS.--------  RECENTLY A NEW BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR MRS. PHYLLIS F. NEWKIRK, HAS BEEN INSTALLED AT THE INDIANA STATE PRISON. AS BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR SHE IS THE FIGUREHEAD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND CONTROL OF FISCAL RECORDING AND PROCESSING. MONEY RECEIVED AT AN ADULT PRISON FROM A SOURCE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION SHALL BE IN THE FORM OF A POSTAL MONEY ORDER, CERTIFIED OR CASHIER'S CHEEK OR GOVERNMENT CHECK. THE WARDENS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATORS AT EACH PRISON SHALL BE HELD IN STRICT ACCOUNTING FOR ALL MONEY HELD IN TRUST FOR A PRISONER. I.C. 4-24-6-1 ET SEQ.

THE PRISONER'-----S TRUST FUND BALANCE SHEET IS SUPPOSE TO SHOW ANY INTEREST ACCRUED AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECREATION FUND MONTHLY. BUT THE PRISONERS ARE NEVER ADVISED OR NOTIFIED HOW MUCH INTEREST IS ACCRUED ON THEIR MONEY.--------  THE OFFICIALS ARE ENFORCING A BOGUS POLICY TO PREVENT THE CAPTIVES FROM RECEIVING MONEY FROM ANYBODY WHO IS NOT LISTED ON THEIR VISITOR LIST. BUT THERE IS NO ACTUAL POLICY AS SUCH.--------  IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THESE PRISON OFFICIALS HAVE DEVISED A LONG TERM CONSPIRACY TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE CAPTIVES FROM SUPPORT BY PREVENTING THEM FROM COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE THROUGH LETTERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.--------  A PRELUDE TO THIS INCIDIOUS GOAL IS PERPETRATED BY REJECTING ALL MONEY RECEIVED AT THE PRISON FOR A CAPTIVE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS NOT ON THEIR APPROVED VISITOR LIST. THIS UNDERHANDED PLOY ALSO UNDERMINES A CAPTIVE'-----S VISITING PRIVILEGE BECAUSE A VISITOR'-----S NAME WOULD HAVE TO BE DISPLACED ON HIS OR HER LIST WHO MIGHT WANT TO PHYSICALLY VISIT A PARTICULAR CAPTIVE, MERELY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO BE PLACED ON THEIR LIST TO SEND THEM A LITTLE MONEY ONCE IN A WHILE.----------------------------------------  XX-----  ZOLO AGONA AZANIA---- #4969  INDIANA STATE PRISON----  PO BOX---- 41  MICHIGAN CITY, IN---- 46361-0041  U.S.A.-------------   MR.

FILE (2)----------------------------------------------------------   PRAYING FOR A MIRACLE----------------  BY TALIB BECKTEMBA--------  REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS;--------  I HAVE NEVER BEEN ONE TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHAPE AND CONTROL OTHER HUMAN INTERACTIONS. BUT AS I EVOLVE IN THIS EVER CHANGING WORLD AND WITNESS THE MADNESS WHICH AFFECTS US ALL, I AM BEGINNING TO THINK THAT A MIRACLE IS JUST WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO TRANSFORM SOME OF THESE REACTIONARIES INTO RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTABLE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO NATIONAL STRUGGLES AIMED AT LIBERATING NEW AFRIKA.--------  WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH SO MUCH DIFFICULTY WITHIN THE COURSE OF OUR DAILY LIVES THAT THE SIMPLE ACT OF LIVING IS BECOMING A REAL CHORE. I USE TO WONDER WHY SOME PEOPLE WOULD PRAY WHEN CONFRONTED WITH VARIOUS DIFFICULT SITUATIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE CAN NEVER BE ANY SUBSTITUTE FOR CONCRETE STRUGGLES IN ITS MANY MANIFESTATIONS. BUT WHEN I REALIZED THAT SOME OF US ARE NOT PRAYING FOR SOME GOD'-----S INTERVENTION INTO OUR SOCIAL REALITIES, BUT THAT THEY ARE PRAYING FOR THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE TO STRUGGLE ON BECAUSE AT MOMENTS IN OUR LIVES OUR CONDITIONS BECOME ALMOST UNBEARABLE. OUR SYSTEMATIC OPPRESSION, REPRESSION, DEPRIVATION, AND THE COLONIAL VIOLENCE THAT WE EXPERIENCE DAILY HAS EFFECTED THE VERY FIBER OF OUR BEING.--------  SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT WE ARE POWERLESS TO MAKE A CHANGE AND----- "TO YOU-----" I SAY THAT YOU DON'-----T KNOW YOUR OWN STRENGTH. THAT POWER THAT WE TRULY POSSESS IF WE CAN GET PAST ALL OF OUR PETTY DIFFERENCES AND DEVELOP A LOVE AND CONCERN FOR EACH OTHER NATIONALLY AS WE COLLECTIVELY CONFRONT OUR NATIONAL CRISIS. AND SOME OF YOU MAY INDEED BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE A MIRACLE TO GET PAST ALL OF OUR INTERNAL DIFFERENCES TO DO THIS WORK TOGETHER. BUT ALL IT WILL TRULY TAKE IS THE PERSONAL COMMITMENT OF EACH ONE OF US TO MAKE THIS CHANGE AND UNITE IN COMMON STRUGGLE.--------  THE MIRACLE OF CHANGE EXISTS IN EACH ONE OF US AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS REALIZE OUR OWN POTENTIAL AND WORK TOGETHER INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO DESTROY US ALL WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL DISPLAYS OF SAVAGERY. WE HAVE TO RISE ABOVE ALL THIS MADNESS BECAUSE IT'-----S A NEW DAY.--------  UHURU--------  TALIB BECKTEMBA---------------------------------------------------------   MILK...----------------  BY IMXN RASXL--------  WHY WOULD ONE SPECIES NEED THE MILK OF ANOTHER SPECIES? COWS DRINK COW'-----S MILK, GOATS DRINK GOAT'-----S MILK, DOGS DRINK DOG'-----S MILK. SO, SHOULDN'-----T HUMAN BEINGS DRINK HUMAN BEING MILK? THAT WOULD SEEM MORE LOGICAL THAN HUMANS DRINKING COW'-----S MILK OR GOAT'-----S MILK. HOW COMMON IS IT FOR A LION TO DRINK MILK FROM A FEMALE ZEBRA? IT'-----S JUST NOT WITHIN ITS NATURE TO DO SO. PICTURE A HUMAN BEING BEING BREAST FEEDING OR BEING BREAST FED BY A COW OR GOAT. HOW SILLY DOES THAT SEEM? HOW MANY FULL GROWN ANIMALS (E.G. BEARS, DOGS, DEER, LIONS, MOOSES, COWS) DO YOU KNOW OF THAT DRINK MILK?--------  ONCE WE ARE WEANED FROM THE NIPPLE THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO CONTINUE DRINKING OUR MOTHER'-----S BREAST MILK. IF THERE WAS A NEED FOR HUMANS TO DRINK MILK AFTER WE REACH A CERTAIN AGE THEN DON'-----T YOU THINK HUMAN MILK WOULD BE SOLD IN GALLON JUGS AT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORES? LET'-----S USE SOME COMMON SENSE FOR A MOMENT.... WHEN A CHILD IS BORN ITS LITTLE BONES AREN'-----T QUITE STRONG ENOUGH. THIS IS WHY IT IS UNABLE TO STAND ON ITS OWN OR HOLD CERTAIN OBJECT OF WEIGHT. THIS IS ALSO WHY THE CHILD MUST BE BREAST FED BY ITS MOTHER TO RECEIVE THE CALCIUM IT NEEDS FOR STRONGER BONES AND DEVELOPMENT. ONCE THE CHILD REACH 10-12 MONTHS OLD, ITS BONES ARE USUALLY STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ITS BODY WEIGHT, WALK, AND HOLD HEAVIER OBJECTS, THUS THE CHILD SOON OUT GROWS THE NEED TO BE BREAST FED.--------  SOME BABIES ARE FED ANIMAL'-----S MILK INSTEAD OF ITS OWN MOTHER'-----S NATURAL MILK. SIMILAC, AND INFANTMEAL ARE MILK LIKE FORMULAS THAT ARE FED TO NEW BORN BABIES AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ITS MOTHER'-----S BREAST MILK. THE CHILD IS USUALLY FED THESE KINDS OF FORMULAS FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE BEING SWITCHED TO COW'-----S MILK. THIS COW'-----S MILK IS CONSUMED FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD WITHOUT THE REALIZATION THAT IT ISN'-----T NEEDED FOR OUR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ANYMORE, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT IT'-----S NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION PERIOD.--------  WE SEE MILK COMMERCIALS AND BILLBOARD SIGNS ADVERTISING MILK FROM COWS AS IF ITS NATURAL FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO DRINK. A COMMON PHRASE THAT WE SEE AND HEAR IS,----- "GOT MILK?-----" OR----- "DRINK MILK, IT DOES A BODY GOOD-----". BUT HOW COULD IT DO THE BODY GOOD WHEN IT'-----S A KNOWN CAUSE FOR COLON CANCER, MORE COMMON AMONGST BLACK PEOPLE. IT HAS A NUMBER OF ILL EFFECTS ON THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SUCH AS, STOMACH BLOATING, EXCESSIVE GAS, INTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS, BOWEL DISFUNCTIONS, CONSTIPATION AND OF COURSE THE LIST GOES ON. BUT LET THE FARM INDUSTRIES TELL IT, IT'-----S ALL GOOD FOR US TO CONSUME THIS PRODUCT. IT'-----S ALL ABOUT THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR IN THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THE PROFIT MAKERS (CAPITALIST) IT MATTERS NOT WHO'-----S HEALTH IS EFFECTED LATER ON IN LIFE BY IT. TO THE FARM INDUSTRIES, IT ALL MAKE SENSE.--------- LET'-----S BE REAL ABOUT THIS. I MEAN, HOW CAN SOMETHING BE BOTH GOOD AND BAD AT THE SAME TIME FOR OUR BODIES? WHAT SENSE DOES IT MAKE TO HAVE----- "STRONG BONES-----" YET, ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE SERIOUS DIGESTIVE AND INTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS WHICH CAN AND OFTEN TIMES WILL LEAD TO COLON CANCER? IT JUST DOESN'-----T ADD UP. BUT OF COURSE IT DOES (ADD UP $$$$$$$) FOR THE CAPITALIST FARMERS OF THIS COUNTRY. IT'-----S NOT BEYOND BELIEF THAT IF WOMEN COULD PRODUCE MILK LIKE COWS AND GOATS, HER MILK WOULD BE SOLD IN CARTONS AND GALLON JUGS AT THE CORNER GROCERY STORES. NOW IMAGINE THAT....--------  IMXN RASXL----  #854623 D-326-WEST----  INDIANA STATE PRISON----  PO BOX---- 41  MICHIGAN CITY, IN--------------------------------------------------------- 46361-0041   OBJECTIVE WILL VS. SUBJECTIVE WILL----------------  BY OBAM-------- 6/12/99  THE NORMAL AND PREVALENT BELIEF IS THAT WE, HOMOSEPIENS, THE HUMAN SPECIES, ARE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN. THIS CAN HARDLY BE DISPUTED. IT IS ALSO A WELL ESTABLISHED BELIEF THAT WE ARE OF A HIGHER INTELLIGENCE THAN ALL OTHER FORMS OF LIFE AND GIVEN DOMINION OVER ALL OTHER SPECIES BY GOD HIMSELF.--------  OUR----- "WILL-----" IS THOUGHT TO BE FOR THE MOST PART INDEPENDENT AS OPPOSED TO BEING A RESULT OF SOCIALIZATION. THE COMMON BELIEF AMONG THE POPULOUS (MOSTLY IGNORANT TO EVEN THE BASICS OF PSYCHOLOGY) AND EVEN SOME SOCIAL SCIENTISTS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH ENVIRONMENT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING A PERSON'-----S PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, MORALS, VALUES, ETHICS, ETC., THAT WHICH WILL PREVAIL OVER SOCIAL INDOCTRINATIONS IS----- "INDEPENDENT WILL-----". I'-----M SURE YOU'-----VE HEARD MANY TIMES STATEMENTS TO THE-EFFECT OF,----- "I UNDERSTAND HE HAD A CHILDHOOD OF ABUSE, DRUGS, VIOLENCE, POVERTY, ETC., BUT HE KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG, AND HE----- `CHOSE'----- TO DO WRONG-----". THESE ARE STATEMENTS OFTEN MADE BY PROSECUTORS, VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. YOU CAN EVEN HEAR THIS SENTIMENT VOICED AMONG THOSE ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS EQUATION - PRISONERS THEMSELVES. YOU ALSO HEAR,----- "I CAME UP IN THE GHETTO, TOO, BUT----- `I'----- DIDN'-----T TURN TO DRUGS AND CRIME.-----" WELL, I RESPECT THEIR HONESTY IF THAT'-----S INDEED WHAT IT IS, BUT IT IS DERIVED FROM IGNORANCE; IGNORANCE OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE MIND; IGNORANCE OF HUMAN NATURE.--------  MORALS, VALUES, AND ETHICS, RELATIVELY, ARE NOT PASSED ON THROUGH GENES AND ARE NOT A PART OF OUR----- "MENTAL WIRING-----". HOWEVER, MENTAL WIRING DOES PLAY A PART IN HOW SHARP OR DULL WE ARE IN PERCEPTION AND COGNITION. GENETICS AND THE QUALITY OF PRENATAL CARE CAN DETERMINE TO A LARGE DEGREE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM, I.E., WHETHER WE PERCEIVE SLOWLY OR QUICKLY; OUR ABILITY TO DECIPHER AND REMEMBER INFORMATION; WHETHER WE HAVE A DULL CHARACTER OR AN ERRATIC, HYPER CHARACTER. ALL THESE THINGS CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ALSO BY BRAIN CHEMISTRY. THESE FACTORS ARE FOR THE MOST PART INDEPENDENT OF DIRECT SOCIALIZATION, BUT THEY DO NOT DETERMINE MORALS, VALUES, AND ETHICS. THESE ARE DETERMINED BY SOCIALIZATION, I.E., FAMILY, HOME UPBRINGING, COMMUNITY, SCHOOL, MEDIA, CHURCH, TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES, ETC.; ALL THAT ENTERS THE BRAIN BY WAY OF THE FIVE SENSES.--------  THE MIND IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX ENTITY. THOUGH WE SEEM TO LIVE ACCORDING TO OUR CONSCIOUS DECISIONS, THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IS WHAT DICTATES TO OUR CONSCIOUS MIND, AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IS CONSTRUCTED SECOND BY SECOND, MINUTE BY MINUTE, HOUR BY HOUR, DAY BY DAY, YEAR BY YEAR FROM THE----- "INTAKE-----" OF OUTSIDE STIMULI VIA THE FIVE SENSES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF INFORMATION THAT WE ABSORB WE ABSORB SUBCONSCIOUSLY (WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT), NEVERTHELESS IT IS ABSORBED AND BECOMES A PART OF OUR SUBCONSCIOUS INFLUENCING OUR EMOTIONS, VALUES, ETHICS, ETC., HENCE, OUR CONSCIOUS DECISIONS. TAKE ETHICS IN PARTICULAR; THE STANDARD OF WHAT IS RIGHT AND JUST AS DISTINCT FROM WRONG AND EVIL. ONE MAY WELL KNOW THAT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES ARE WRONG----- "ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND THE MAINSTREAM MORAL STANDARDS-----", BUT IN HIS/HER----- "OWN COMMUNITY AND CULTURE-----" THESE ACTIVITIES ARE PREVALENT AND ACCEPTED PRACTICES, AND EVENTHOUGH ONE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE ILLEGAL AND IMMORAL, BECAUSE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE PORTRAYED, CONSCIOUSLY AND SUBLIMINALLY, THE PROPENSITY FOR ONE TO PARTAKE IN THESE ACTIVITIES IS MUCH GREATER. THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS, AND ONE RULE DOESN'-----T APPLY TO EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL SITUATION, BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MISS MY POINT IS TO BE MENTALLY DEFICIENT OR EITHER IN EXTREME DENIAL. GIVEN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND A DIFFERENT UPBRINGING, YOU COULD VERY WELL BE JUST LIKE THE PERSON YOU DESPISE THE MOST.--------  FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, LET'-----S SAY THAT EVERYONE DOES HAVE AN INDEPENDENT WILL. HOW THEN COULD YOU EXPLAIN ONES CHOOSING TO DO WRONG? EITHER THEY ARE BAD BY NURTURE OR THEY ARE BAD BY NATURE. IT'-----S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. THERE'-----S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE OR EXPLANATION. THE OPPONENTS OF MY THEORY WOULD HAVE TO ARGUE THAT IT IS NATURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE THEORY OF NURTURE (SOCIALIZATION) AS A CAUSE OF ONE BEING BAD, EVIL, A SOCIAL MENACE, ETC. NOW, IF A PERSON IS BAD BY NATURE AS OPPOSED TO NURTURE, HOW CAN THEY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BAD CONDUCT? THINK CRITICALLY BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF YOU'-----VE NEVER VENTURED ON THESE GROUNDS BEFORE. IF A PERSON IS INDEED A BAD OR EVIL PERSON, I PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS BY NATURE. I STAND ON THE THEORY OF SOCIALIZATION. THIS IS NOT A CRUTCH, AN EXCUSE, A SCAPEGOAT, ETC.; IT'-----S A FACT. NO DOUBT, MANY MISUSE AND ABUSE THIS THEORY AS A SCAPEGOAT TO FURTHER THEIR PERSONAL INTEREST TAKING AWAY FROM THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ARGUMENT WHEN PRESENTED UNDER SERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.--------  TO PUT THIS ISSUE OF PSYCHOLOGY INTO A POLITICAL, REVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE, LET ME BEGIN BY STATING THAT PSYCHOLOGY IS AN INTEGRALCOMPONENT OF POLITICS, REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS IN PARTICULAR. GOVERNMENTAL POLICY (POLITICS) INFLUENCES SOCIAL NORMS AND CULTURE, AND SOCIAL NORMS AND CULTURE IN TURN INFLUENCE GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, BUT THE FORMER IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS.--------  TODAY IN THE U.S. WE SEE THE FANATICAL RELIGIOUS, RIGHT-WING BLAMING THE SO-CALLED LIBERALS FOR THE COUNTRY'-----S MORAL DECAY. IN PARTICULAR----- "NEWT-----" BLAMED THE LIBERALS FOR THE MASS MURDER COMMITTED BY THE TWO TEENS AT COLUMBINE HIGHSCHOOL IN COLORADO. ON THE ONE HAND THESE HYPOCRITES CONDEMN----- "BIG GOVERNMENT-----" ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INTERFERES WITH BIG BUSINESS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY SEEK TO REPRESS AND CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF OUR PERSONAL LIVES. THEY SEEK TO SET THE STANDARDS FOR PROPER FAMILY STRUCTURE, FAMILY VALUES, EDUCATION, RELIGION, RESPONSIBLE MEDIA, CORRECT CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION, ETC. AND CONDEMN ALL OTHER OPINIONS.--------  THE SAME RESTRICTIONS OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS THAT ARE IN PRACTICE NOW IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THE SAME RESTRICTIONS OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WAS CONDEMNING SO-CALLED COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FOR TEN, TWENTY, THIRTY YEARS AGO. ONLY HERE, THEY'-----RE CALLED----- "SOCIAL CONTRACTS-----", I.E. ANTI-CRIME LAWS, WAR ON DRUGS, GUN SAFETY AND CONTROL, ETC.--------  THE U.S SUPREME COURT RECENTLY RULED THAT IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO PROHIBIT----- "CITIZENS-----" FROM HANGING OUT ON THE STREETS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY APPEARED TO BE GANG MEMBERS. THIS HAS BEEN IN PRACTICE IN CHICAGO SINCE THE EARLY 90S. EVENTHOUGH IT WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL, YOU CAN BELIEVE THEY'-----LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING JUST AS REPRESSIVE IF NOT MORE SO.--------  AS FOR THEIR LAISSEZ FAIRE (HANDS OFF BIG BUSINESS) POLICY, YOU CAN BET THAT IT'-----S NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING EQUALITY IN THE FREE MARKET. IT IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FURTHERING THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH INTO THE HANDS OF A FEW - MONOPOLY CAPITALISM.--------  THE POPULOUS ARE BLIND TO THESE FACTS, AND EVEN WORSE, MANY WOULDN'-----T REALLY CARE A GREAT DEAL IF THEY KNEW THE REALITY OF IT ALL. THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, I.E. MEDIA, EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, RELIGION, ENTERTAINMENT, ETC. SHAPE OUR ETHICS, VALUES, ETC. MORE NOW THAN EVER, BECAUSE THEY ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE INTRUSIVE INTO OUR PERSONAL LIVES. MANY SAY YOU CAN'-----T LEGISLATE MORALS. I SAY THAT LEGISLATION IMPACTS SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS IMPACT MORALS, BUT NO AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION CAN OVERWHELM OR CORRECT THE EFFECTS OF CAPITALISM THAT HAVE DEGRADED ALL THAT IS SPIRITUALLY SOUND AND LIFE LOVING. IT TAKES REVOLUTION.--------  AS I STATED BEFORE, GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, OR LACK THERE OF, CAN INFLUENCE SOCIAL NORMS AND CULTURE. FOR INSTANCE, THE GOVERNMENT'-----S ECONOMIC POLICY OF LAISSEZ FAIRE (ALLOWING THE MARKET TO PROCEED WITH LITTLE OR NO ANTI-TRUST PROTECTION) INEVITABLY LEADS TO THE ACCUMULATION OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WEALTH AND POWER INTO THE HANDS OF A SMALL POWER ELITE AND AN EVER INCREASING POVERTY CLASS OF DESPAIR CREATING A CULTURE OF CRIME, VIOLENCE, DRUGS, CUT-THROAT INDIVIDUALISM, IGNORANCE, ETC. THE GOVERNMENT'-----S POLICY OF REFUSING TO PROSECUTE CLEAR CUT CASES OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND CORRUPTION CREATES A SENTIMENT TOWARDS THE C.O.P. (COLONIAL OCCUPATIONAL PERSONNEL) AND THE STATE OF UNTRUSTWORTHINESS AND VINDICTIVENESS TO SAY THE LEAST, ESPECIALLY AMONG POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHILE IN TURN CREATING A SENTIMENT TOWARDS THE COPS AND STATE AMONG THE UPPER CLASS AND MOST WHITES OF PATRIOTIC PROTECTORS. THE GOVERNMENT'-----S POLICY OF MISREPRESENTING HISTORY, ESPECIALLY IN THE ACADEMIC AND RELIGIOUS FIELDS CONTRIBUTES TO THE CULTURAL PERCEPTION OF WHITE SUPERIORITY AND BLACK INFERIORITY. THE GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES THAT GIVE LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO FEMALES, MAINLY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, AUTOMATICALLY REINFORCES THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED CULTURE OF SEXISM, FEMALE SUBSERVIENCE AND INFERIORITY - PATRIARCHY.--------  EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES IS A PART OF THE U.S. CAPITALIST CULTURE IN LARGE PART AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENTAL POLICY. THESE ARE MAJOR YET GENERAL EXAMPLES, HOWEVER THE SAME----- "CAUSE AND EFFECT-----" PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS, BUT ARE CONNECTED TO THE GENERAL CULTURE.--------  IT'-----S BEEN SAID QUITE FREQUENTLY THAT PRISONS ARE MICROCOSMS OF THAT SOCIETY AT LARGE. THE HIGHEST RATES PER CAPITA OF CRIME, MURDER IN PARTICULAR, SUICIDE, IMPRISONMENT ARE IN THE U.S., AND IT IS THE ONLY DEVELOPED, INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD THAT STILL HAS THE DEATH PENALTY, YET IT IS CALLED THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD. WELL, LET ME SAY THIS: A DEMOCRACY IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE PEOPLE'-----S LEVEL OF POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS. THE PEOPLE (PROLETARIAT) CAN NOT TRULY DICTATE IF THEY DO NOT TRULY OVERSTAND THE SCIENCE OF SOCIETY, POLITICS AND ECONOMICS. THEY CAN ONLY BE DICTATEES; PAWNS IN THE GAME OF THE POWER ELITE, VOTING FOR ILLUSIONS.--------  YOU ASK,----- "HOW DOES ALL THIS RELATE TO THE TITLE?-----" AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON MAKES DECISIONS FROM A SUBJECTIVE WILL THAT IS CONTROLLED BY THOSE IN CONTROL OF THAT PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT.--------  THE FOLLOWING IS AN ANALOGY STATED QUITE PROFICIENTLY BY MR. HOOVER:-------------  "HAVING A SUBJECTIVE WILL IS LIKE BEING IN SOMEONE ELSE'-----S DREAM. A DREAM IN WHICH YOU HAVE NO POWER TO CREATE THE SCENES OR CHANGE THEM. LET'-----S IMAGINE THAT THE DREAM IS ABOUT LIFE AND THE DREAMER IS ABLE TO MAKE THE LAWS AND CHANGE THE LAWS OR HE CAN MAKE----- `NEW LAWS'----- TO HOLD YOU IN CHECK IF YOU BEGIN TO WIN IN HIS GAME OF LIFE. HE COULD MAKE YOU RICH AND FAMOUS OR HE COULD MAKE YOU A WINO, DRUG ADDICT OR A CRIMINAL (ACCORDING TO HIS LAW). IN HIS DREAM, YOU ARE USED TO HIS ENDS. YOUR ACTIONS WOULD ONLY BE REACTIONS THAT HE COULD CONTROL, CALCULATE AND PREDICT AND WHEN HE HAS NO MORE USE FOR YOU, HE COULD ELIMINATE YOU FROM HIS DREAM. OR HE MAY JUST DECIDE TO STORE YOU AWAY IN SOME SORT OF----- `WAREHOUSE'----- FOR HIS FUTURE USE. OR PERHAPS HE WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH DRUGS AND GUNS AND LET YOU SMOKE AND SHOOT YOUR WAY OUT OF EXISTENCE.-----" FROM THE BLUE PRINT--------  IN ORDER FOR CAPITALISM OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESSIVE, CORRUPT SYSTEM TO PERSIST AND THRIVE, THE MASS MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE OF A SUBJECTIVE WILL.--------  AS I STATED EARLIER, A DEMOCRACY IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE PEOPLE'-----S LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. DEMOCRACY IS SYNONYMOUS WITH SOCIALISM, AND IN ORDER FOR TRUE SOCIALISM TO EXIST, THE PEOPLE MUST BE OF AN OBJECTIVE WILL WHICH ENTAILS BEING CONSCIOUS OF SOCIETY/ENVIRONMENT AND ITS ABILITY TO INDOCTRINATE SO THEY WON'-----T BE SUBJECT TO THAT INDOCTRINATION. AN OBJECTIVE WILL ALSO ENTAILS THE ABILITY TO SHAPE THE ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED TO BEING SHAPED BY THE ENVIRONMENT. NOW YOU MAY ASK,----- "WHY WOULD I WORRY ABOUT BEING NEGATIVELY INDOCTRINATED IF THE SYSTEM IS SOCIALIST?-----" THE ANSWER: EVENTHOUGH A SYSTEM MAY BE SOCIALIST, IN THE INTEREST OF THE POPULOUS, THERE IS ALWAYS A LATENT FORCE LURKING INTERNALLY AND/OR EXTERNALLY SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE STATUS QUO. THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS TO EVERYTHING. THIS IS THE LAW OF DIALECTICS. HENCE, WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE FORCES OF CAPITALISM AND OTHER CORRUPT SYSTEMS FROM OVERCOMING SOCIALISM IS NOT ONLY A CONSCIOUS PEOPLE BUT A SYSTEM THAT SYSTEMATICALLY INSTILLS CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE PEOPLE VIA THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, I.E. EDUCATION, RELIGION, ENTERTAINMENT, ETC. THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM.--------  YOU CAN NOT DISCONNECT AN INDIVIDUAL'-----S ACTIONS AND THOUGHTS FROM THE SOCIETY AND CULTURE AT LARGE, AND YOU CAN NOT DISCONNECT CULTURE AND SOCIETY AT LARGE FROM GOVERNMENTAL POLICY. WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE AN ISOLATED INCIDENT MAY VERY WELL SOON BECOME AN EPIDEMIC; HENCE KNOW THIS: A PEOPLE'-----S COLLECTIVE WILL IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE TYPE OF SYSTEM UNDER WHICH THOSE PEOPLE LIVE.--------  TRUE SOCIALISM - THE OBJECTIVE WILL OF A CONSCIOUS PEOPLE - IS WHAT WE STRUGGLE FOR.--------  IN GLOBAL SOLIDARITY,--------  OBAM--------  S/N MARC A.TILLMAN---- #940972  P.C.F.----  PO BOX---- 30  PENDLETON, IN------------------------------------------------------------------ 46064   "HIGH SCIENCE WITH ITS FORMULA AND RESULTS:----  THE INTERVIEW.-------------------------"  INTRODUCTION:----  THIS INTERVIEW IS GIVEN BY: RASUUAL BYRD-BEY. I WILL BE INTERVIEWING MY BROTHA MAN OLUGBALA PILI.SUGGS, ON THE MATTERS OF WHAT ONE MUST HAVE TO CONSIDER THEIR SELF. A SCIENTIST, ONE WHO IS CONSCIOUS IN DEEDS..----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  BROTHA OLUGBALA, FIRST LET ME SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL NOT BE IN AGREEMENT WITH SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION; THAT WILL BE SPOKEN ON IN THIS INTERVIEW.----- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SUCH?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  WELL, WE KNOW THAT THE MOORISH HOLY KORAN EXPLAINS THIS ANSWER BEST.----- THE LIPS OF THE WISE ARE AS THE DOORS OF A CABINET NO SOONER ARE THEY OPENED, BUT TREASURES ARE POURED OUT BEFORE THEE----------------!  BYRD-BEY:-------------  MY BROTHA MAN YOU ANSWER WELL.----- SO COULD YOU NOW TELL ME AND OTHERS WHO MAY NOT KNOW, BUT CALL OURSELVES SCIENTISTS WHAT SCIENCE IS?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  SCIENCE IS A SYSTEM. IT IS-A WORD TAKEN FROM LATIN, MEANING----- "TO KNOW-----" THAT WHICH WE USE FOR KNOWLEDGE, THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED AND INTERPRETED IN A CERTAIN SYSTEMATIC WAY. WE ALSO USE THE WORD FOR THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION AND INTERPRETATION, SO THAT A----- "SCIENTIST-----" IS ONE WHO BRING A FORMULA OF SCIENCE; WITH THE OBSERVATION OF UNEXPLAINED FACTS----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  SO, AS THE OBSERVER STUDIES THE OBSERVATIONS WHAT DOES HE SEE?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  HE SEES INTERRELATIONSHIPS AND PATTERNS, BUT SHE GENERALIZES A PATTERN TO COVER UNOBSERVED FACTS, AND HE DEVISES A TENTATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE PATTERN. A----- "HYPOTHESIS.---------------------"  BYRD-BEY:-------------  WHAT DOES ONE DO WITH THIS HYPOTHESIS YOU SPEAK ON?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  ONE THEN TEST THE HYPOTHESIS ON NEW OBSERVATIONS WITH A PLANNED EXPERIMENT. AND IF THE EXPERIMENT FAILS TO CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS, THE OBSERVERS MUST FORMULATE A NEW HYPOTHESIS AND CONDUCT ANOTHER EXPERIMENT. IF THAT EXPERIMENT DOES CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS; THEN THE HYPOTHESIS BECOMES A PART OF THE OBSERVER'-----S COLLECTION OF----- "KNOWLEDGE-----". THROUGH REPEATED CONFORMATIONS ALONG WITH SUCCESS IN HELPING TO EXPLAIN NEW OBSERVATIONS PROMOTES A HYPOTHESIS TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FACTS, PRINCIPLE, LAW AND THEORY;----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  COULD YOU ALSO TELL ME AND THE OTHER READERS ABOUT ONE (1) CRUCIAL PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  ONE (1) CRUCIAL PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS (-----"CAUTION-----") RESEARCHERS------"SEEKER-----" GO TO GREAT PAIN TO AVOID THE MANY KINDS OF ERROR AND BIAS (ENCOURAGING ONE OUTCOME OR ANSWER OVER THE-OTHER) THAT CAN CONTAMINATE EXPERIMENTS. WE CONDUCT CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS (WHERE EVERYTHING IS THE SAME EXCEPT THE VARIABLE BEING TESTED) TO BE SURE THAT THE RESULTS WE SEE ARE----- "REAL-----" AND NOT UNFORESEEN EFFECTS OF OUR EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS: FURTHER WE MUST ANALYZE THESE RESULTS WITH STATISTICS.------------------BYRD-BEY:-------------  COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME AND OTHERS ABOUT ANOTHER ESSENTIAL PART OF THE METHOD?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  ANOTHER ESSENTIAL PART OF THE METHOD IS----- "COMMUNICATION-----", THE GREATER PARTS ON OUR LIST. HOWEVER, OBSERVATION, GENERALIZATION, HYPOTHESIS, AND EXPERIMENT ARE ALL USELESS IF THEY ARE KEPT SECRET; LET'-----S TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS BY SAYING, A RESULT IS NOT A RESULT -- IT HAS NO VALIDITY, NO (CREDIBILITY GAP) -- IF OTHER SCIENTIST CANNOT OBTAIN THE SAME RESULT. AS SCIENTISTS WE ARE SURE YOU CAN FILL IN THE BLANKS AS WORDS WERE LEFT OUT; THUS THE SCIENTIST MUST WRITE AND PUBLISH SCIENTIFIC REPORTS THAT-EXPLAIN OBSERVATIONS, GENERALIZATION, HYPOTHESIS, AND EXPERIMENTS IN DETAIL SO THAT OTHERS WHO SEEK CAN REPEAT THE WORK.----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  OKAY NOW, TELL US-WHAT SCIENCE IS FIRMLY BASED ON?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  WELL, SCIENCE IS FIRMLY BASED ON THE NOTION OF REPEATABILITY; IT HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR THE UNIQUE AND FOR THOSE WHO KEEP THEIR METHODS OR FINDINGS SECRET, AND EVEN LESS ROOM FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO-MANUFACTURE FALSE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. BECAUSE THIS DEMAND FOR REPEATABILITY MEANS THAT EVERY STEP OF A SCIENTIST'-----S WORK MUST BE CHECKABLE; SCIENCE POSSESSES AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND DUTY, A-DEDICATION TO TRUTH, ACCURACY, AND COMPLETENESS THAT SURPASSES ALL OTHER ALLEGIANCES.----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  OUT OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE COVERED COULD YOU TELL US WHAT THE----- "ATTRIBUTES-----" OF A SCIENTIST IS?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  AS A SCIENTIST YOUR----- "ATTRIBUTES-----" ARE AS IMPORTANT AS ALL OTHER FORMULAS. A SCIENTIST SEEK-KNOWLEDGE, TRUTH, AND----- "HUMAN SURVIVAL-----". USING THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD, POTENTIAL SCIENTIST NEED THE ABILITY TO WORK AND THINK METHODICALLY; WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE OTHER TRAITS BECAUSE SCIENTIST IN----- "GENERAL-----" ARE PERSISTENT, CURIOUS, PRECISE, INTELLIGENT, OBJECTIVE, HONEST, ENTHUSIASTIC, AND HUMBLE; (IF THEIR HYPOTHESIS IS CONFIRMED RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.)----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------  WELL, BROTHA OLUGBALA-WE WILL WRAP THIS INTERVIEW UP SHORTLY, BUT LET ME SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS BLESSING FOR MYSELF TO HEAR A LESSON BEING TAUGHT... NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE TWO (-) FINAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU. HOW DID YOU RECEIVE THIS CHEMISTRY THAT GIVES VALUABLE INFORMATION?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  I-RECEIVED THIS FORMULA THROUGH CRONYISM = WHICH MEANS FAVORITISM SHOWN TO OLD FRIENDS WITHOUT REGARD FOR THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. MY GOOD BROTHA-MAN FRANK JAMES-BEY, WHOM I HONOR FULL-HEARTILY, TAUGHT ME MUCH. SO THIS I ATTAINED FROM HIM; AND THROUGH YEARS OF STUDY.----------------  BYRD-BEY:-------------- OKAY, WE ARE NOW AT-THE CLOSE OF THIS INTERVIEW, IS THERE ANY GOOD MEASURE OF LAST WORDS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY?----------------  OLUGBALA:-------------  YES THERE IS MY BROTHA-MAN. I EMPHASIZE THIS FOR THE CONSCIOUS-ONES, WE MUST NOW GO BEYOND ELEMENTARY, WE'-----RE SCIENTISTS-THE FORMULA HAS BEEN-MIXED WITH FAVORABLE----- "ATTRIBUTES-----" IT'-----S TIME TO CONFIRM THAT WE-CAN BE AS VALUABLE AS ANY OTHER CULTURE OF PEOPLE.-LEARN THAT THE ADVANTAGES-LIETH NOT IN POSSESSING GOOD THINGS, BUT IN THE KNOWING----- "TO-----" USE THEM. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS TO COME--------!
