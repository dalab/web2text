ENERGY SOURCES, INCLUDING WIND POWER, ARE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS- A WAY OF MEETING THE NATION'-----S ENERGY REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALSO CONTRIBUTING- TO CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, PROMOTING FOSSIL FUEL CONSERVATION, AND -REDUCING OTHER HARMFUL POLLUTANTS SUCH AS SULFUR DIOXIDE AND NITROGEN OXIDE.- HOWEVER, RENEWABLES CAN ALSO BE MORE EXPENSIVE, AND BY THEIR NATURE SOME- ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO MEET BASELOAD ELECTRICITY DEMANDS. THIS PAPER- DESCRIBES THE METHODOLOGY USED IN THE NATIONAL ENERGY MODELING SYSTEM (NEMS)- FOR REPRESENTING ELECTRICITY-GENERATION-FROM WIND POWER, ONE OF THE MORE- MATURE AND LOWER COST RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONE-THAT HAS BEEN- PROMINENTLY MENTIONED AS A MEANS OF HELPING TO MEET THE KYOTO PROTOCOL'-----S- CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS FOR THE UNITED STATES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INTRODUCTION----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  EXISTING WIND POWER CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IS APPROXIMATELY- 2,000 MEGAWATTS------ABOUT 0.2 PERCENT OF ALL-U.S. GRID-CONNECTED ELECTRICITY- GENERATING CAPACITY------AND ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 0.1 PERCENT OF GENERATION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^1 AS A CARBON-FREE TECHNOLOGY, HOWEVER, WIND POWER IS INCREASINGLY DISCUSSED- FOR ITS POTENTIAL IN MEETING U.S. AND GLOBAL CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS,- SUCH AS THOSE PROPOSED IN THE 1998 KYOTO ACCORDS. WIND TECHNOLOGY DOES- NOT HAVE FUEL REQUIREMENTS AS DO COAL, GAS, AND PETROLEUM GENERATING-TECHNOLOGIES;- HOWEVER, BOTH THE-EQUIPMENT COSTS AND THE COSTS-OF ACCOMMODATING SPECIAL- CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS INTERMITTENCE, RESOURCE VARIABILITY, COMPETING- DEMANDS FOR LAND USE, AND TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION AVAILABILITY CAN- ADD TO THE COSTS OF GENERATING ELECTRICITY FROM WIND.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE HOW THE ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (EIA) ADDRESSES IN THE NATIONAL ENERGY MODELING SYSTEM (NEMS) THE NATURAL- RESOURCE, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION, AND MARKET FACTORS THAT AFFECT- THE-COST OF U.S. ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM WIND RESOURCES. THIS-INTRODUCTION- SUMMARIZES GENERAL ELECTRICITY MODELING IN NEMS. THE SECOND SECTION,----- "REPRESENTING- WIND GENERATING TECHNOLOGY,-------OUTLINES THE OVERALL NEMS REPRESENTATION OF- WIND, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION-OF THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THE THIRD- AND FOURTH SECTIONS,----- "BASIS FOR WIND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS-----" AND----- "COST- ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR-U.S. WIND SUPPLY,----- "PROVIDE EIA'-----S JUSTIFICATION FOR- AND DERIVATION OF THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THE-SECTIONS SHOW APPLICATIONS- OF THE FACTORS IN RECENT-EIA FORECASTS FOR WIND POWER, IDENTIFY KEY ISSUES- FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION, AND CONCLUDE BY SUMMARIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF- THE ISSUE OF COST.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  NEMS IS AN INTEGRATED COMPUTER MODEL OF THE U.S.-ENERGY ECONOMY.-IT INCLUDES- MODULES REPRESENTING ALL-THE MAJOR SUPPLY AND DEMAND SECTORS THAT PRODUCE- AND CONSUME ENERGY. WITHIN NEMS, THE SELECTION OF NEW GENERATING CAPACITY,- INCLUDING WIND, IS BASED ON THE RELATIVE COSTS OF COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES.- ELECTRICITY GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES COMPETE BASED ON CAPITAL, FUEL, AND- OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O----&M) COSTS FOR PROVIDING U.S. REGIONAL BASELOAD,- INTERMEDIATE, AND PEAKING ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY. INTERMITTENT TECHNOLOGIES- SUCH AS WIND ALSO COMPETE ON THEIR ABILITY TO MEET ELECTRICITY DEMAND AT- THE TIME WINDS ARE AVAILABLE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  CAPITAL COSTS FOR ALL GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER- OF CHARACTERISTICS. USING INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE- ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE, PUBLISHED REPORTS, MEETINGS WITH INDUSTRY- AND TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTATIVES, AND OTHERS, EIA ESTIMATES THE INITIAL CAPITAL- COST FOR EACH TECHNOLOGY.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^2 CAPITAL COSTS DECREASE AS EXPERIENCE WITH THE- TECHNOLOGY INCREASES (LEARNING-BY-DOING EFFECTS), AND AS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL- CAPACITY PENETRATE ELECTRIC POWER MARKETS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^3 AT HIGH RATES OF GROWTH, HOWEVER,- CAPITAL COSTS MAY TEMPORARILY INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO SHORT-TERM BOTTLENECKS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  FUEL COSTS ALSO AFFECT TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION. FOR FOSSIL FUELS, FUEL COSTS- ARE PROJECTED SEPARATELY IN NEMS IN THE INDIVIDUAL FUEL SUPPLY MODULES,- PROVIDING INPUTS FOR SUBSEQUENT CHOICES AMONG GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES.- IN CONTRAST, THE AVAILABILITY AND COST-OF WIND ENERGY------ ESSENTIALLY ITS------ "FUEL-----" COST------ARE REPRESENTED IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WIND TURBINE CAPACITY FACTORS- USED IN NEMS VARY BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, TIME OF DAY AND SEASON, AND BY- THE ESTIMATED ENERGY CONTENT OF AVAILABLE WINDS (WIND CLASS). SECOND, EXPERIENCE- INDICATES-THAT THE ENERGY AVAILABILITY OF WIND TURBINES IS ALSO AFFECTED- BY OTHER FACTORS IN ADDITION TO REGION, TIME, AND WIND CLASS. EIA EXPRESSES- THESE ADDITIONAL FACTORS ALONG WITH OTHERS BY ADJUSTING WIND TECHNOLOGY- CAPITAL COSTS. THE DERIVATION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF- THIS PAPER.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REPRESENTING WIND GENERATING TECHNOLOGY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE METHODOLOGY FOR PROJECTING ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM WIND POWER CONSISTS- OF A SERIES OF DATA INPUTS, CAPACITY AND DISPATCH ALGORITHMS, AND SPECIFIC- COMPONENTS FOR CHARACTERIZING WIND ENERGY SUPPLY. EACH IS DISCUSSED BELOW.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DATA INPUTS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE PRIMARY DATA INPUTS ARE EXISTING WIND GENERATING CAPACITY, FUTURE CAPACITY- PLANNED BY ELECTRICITY-PRODUCERS,-WIND TECHNOLOGY COST AND PERFORMANCE- CHARACTERISTICS, WIND CAPACITY FACTORS, AND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. EIA- COLLECTS INFORMATION ON EXISTING CAPACITY AND THAT PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE- FROM ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND NONUTILITIES, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS- AND SMALL POWER PRODUCERS. PLANNED CAPACITY COMMITMENTS INCLUDE CAPACITY- UNDER CONSTRUCTION, UNDER CONTRACT, MANDATED BY LAW OR REGULATION, OR UNDER- COMMITMENT BY AN ELECTRICITY PRODUCER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  MANDATED NEW WIND CAPACITY IN MINNESOTA AND IOWA, AS WELL AS ESTIMATES- OF-NEW WIND CAPACITY TO BE INSTALLED UNDER STATE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS,- ARE INCLUDED AS PLANNED CAPACITY. IN 1999, FOR EXAMPLE, MORE THAN 600 MEGAWATTS- OF NEW WIND GENERATING CAPACITY ARE PLANNED, SCHEDULED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE- OF THE FEDERAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION INCENTIVE BEFORE ITS EXPIRATION- ON JULY 1,------ PROPOSALS OR GOALS FOR NEW CAPACITY THAT HAVE NOT YET- RESULTED IN FIRM COMMITMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED AS----- "PLANNED.----------------------------------------------------------------------------"  CAPITAL COSTS FOR NEW GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES ARE ASSUMED TO DECLINE AS- MORE UNITS ENTER SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE INCREASES.-EIA DERIVES ESTIMATES- FOR THE KEY COST AND PERFORMANCE VALUES FOR WIND-POWER FROM-A VARIETY OF- SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ELECTRIC-POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE, THE DEPARTMENT- OF ENERGY, OTHER INDUSTRY-PARTICIPANTS, AND CURRENT MARKET DATA.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^4 CAPACITY AND DISPATCH METHODOLOGIES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IN ORDER-TO MEET PROJECTED GROWTH IN THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND TO- REPLACE RETIRING GENERATING UNITS, NEW CAPACITY IS ADDED OVER AND ABOVE- EXISTING AND KNOWN PLANS FOR NEW CAPACITY. THE ESSENTIAL STEPS IN THE METHODOLOGY- ARE TO DETERMINE FUTURE CAPACITY NEEDS BASED ON PEAK DEMANDS, SUBTRACT- CURRENT (NET OF RETIREMENTS) CAPACITY FROM THOSE NEEDS, AND PROJECT THE- TYPES OF CAPACITY THAT MUST BE BUILT TO REACH THE TARGET. THE TECHNOLOGY- CHOICE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON TOTAL COSTS OVER A 30-YEAR HORIZON, INCLUDING- CAPITAL, O----&M, AND FUEL COSTS. TECHNOLOGY CHOICE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY SUBSIDIES- AND TAXES, SUCH AS-THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. -INTERMITTENT TECHNOLOGIES------ MAINLY WIND AND SOLAR------ARE-SPECIAL CASES, BECAUSE- THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND THUS HAVE A-REDUCED ABILITY TO MEET DEMANDS.- THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED BY SEGMENTING ANNUAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND INTO A- NUMBER OF----- "SLICES,-----" DEFINED BY SEASON AND TIME OF DAY. WIND AND SOLAR COMPETE- DIRECTLY FOR NEW CAPACITY TO SERVE THOSE PARTS OF THE LOAD FOR WHICH THEY- ARE MOST SUITED, AND THEY ARE NOT PENALIZED BY CONSIDERING OVERALL ANNUAL- DEMANDS ONLY,-FOR-WHICH THEY-WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY- ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, THEIR CREDITED CONTRIBUTION TO MEET THE PEAK- DEMAND IS REDUCED, BECAUSE THEIR INCLUSION REDUCES THE OVERALL RELIABILITY- OF THE SYSTEM. THE IMPACT OF THIS REDUCTION IS THAT MORE FOSSIL-FUEL-FIRED- CAPACITY MAY BE BUILT-TO MEET THE RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS WHEN WIND IS- CHOSEN AS THE MOST ECONOMICAL TECHNOLOGY.------------------------------------------------------------------------ UNLIKE FOSSIL FUEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE DISPATCHED AT VARYING CAPACITY- FACTORS DEPENDING ON DEMAND AND MARGINAL COST, WIND POWER IS DISPATCHED- IN NEMS AT SPECIFIED CAPACITY FACTORS DERIVED BY EIA AND DIFFERING BY HOUR--OF THE DAY, SEASON, REGION, AND WIND CLASS. WIND CAPACITY FACTORS ARE BASED- IN PART ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ACTUAL UNITS AND IN PART ON THE MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE- SUGGESTED BY RESEARCH ON CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION,- SOME IMPROVEMENT IN WIND CAPACITY FACTORS OVER TIME IS ASSUMED AS NEW CAPACITY- IS USED AND ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS LEARN HOW TO-OPERATE THEIR UNITS MORE- EFFICIENTLY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WIND ENERGY CHARACTERIZATION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WIND ENERGY IS THE----- "FUEL-----" FOR WIND TECHNOLOGIES. BECAUSE WIND'-----S FUEL VALUE- IS PARTLY INCORPORATED IN CAPITAL COSTS AND IS NOT SEPARATELY PRICED, EIA- MODIFIES CAPITAL COSTS FOR WIND PROJECTS ON THE BASIS OF THREE KEY CHARACTERISTICS:- WIND CLASS, COSTS OF BUILDING NEW TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION WITH THE- EXISTING TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, AND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS.- THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS IN NATURAL RESOURCE- QUALITY, COSTS OF UPGRADING THE EXISTING NETWORK, AND EFFECTS OF ALTERNATIVE- USES FOR LANDS WITH WIND RESOURCES. FOR WIND RESOURCES TO BE USEFUL FOR- ELECTRICITY GENERATION, THE SITE MUST (1) HAVE SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL WINDS,- (2) BE LOCATED NEAR EXISTING TRANSMISSION NETWORKS, AND (3) BE ECONOMICALLY- ACCESSIBLE CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE, TRANSMISSION NETWORK,- AND MARKET FACTORS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  WIND TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES ARE FIRST IDENTIFIED BY REGIONAL ESTIMATES- OF AVAILABLE WIND ENERGY. THE FOUNDATION OF EIA'-----S WIND SUPPLY CHARACTERIZATIONS- IS THE ADAPTATION OF STANDARD WIND SUPPLY MAPS PROVIDED BY THE PACIFIC- NORTHWEST LABORATORY (PNL).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^5 THE PNL WIND DATA ARE FIRST EXPRESSED IN SQUARE- KILOMETERS OF LAND, SHOWN BY ELECTRICITY MARKET REGION AND BY WIND ENERGY- CLASS. WIND ENERGY VALUES ARE GROUPED AMONG SEVEN WIND-SPEED CLASSES, WITH- HIGHER NUMBERS INDICATING GREATER ENERGY RESOURCES (TABLE 1). THE FEW CLASS- 7 WIND RESOURCES ARE INCLUDED WITH CLASS 6 (DESIGNATED IN TABLE 1 AS---------- "6+"),- AND WINDS BELOW CLASS 4 ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS NOT ECONOMICALLY USEFUL.- RECOGNIZING THAT SOME LANDS WILL NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR WIND POWER USE,- EIA HAS ADOPTED PNL'-----S----- "MODERATE-----" WIND RESOURCE EXCLUSION SCENARIO (TABLE- 2).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^6 APPLYING THESE CRITERIA, EIA DETERMINES U.S. WIND RESOURCES BY REGION- (TABLE 3).----------------------------------------------------------------------------  TABLE--- WIND CLASSES FOR WIND ENERGY CHARACTERIZATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TABLE--- PERCENTAGES OF LANDS EXCLUDED FROM WIND ENERGY CHARACTERIZATION IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORY MODERATE EXCLUSION SCENARIO------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TABLE--- U.S. WIND RESOURCES FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION, BY WIND CLASS AND NEMS REGION---------------------------------------------------------------------------  AS SHOWN IN TABLE 3, THE UNITED STATES HAS AMPLE WIND RESOURCES. FIGURE- 1 SHOWS THE POTENTIAL U.S. WIND SUPPLY FOR WIND POWER STATIONS AT DIFFERENT- CAPITAL COSTS (EXCLUDING LEARNING EFFECTS, IMPROVING CAPACITY FACTORS,- AND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^7 ALTHOUGH WIND TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT COMPARABLE- TO BASELOAD OR OTHER GENERATING CAPACITY, TOTAL U.S. WIND RESOURCES EQUAL- ABOUT THREE TIMES TOTAL U.S. GENERATING CAPACITY AND COULD PRODUCE ROUGHLY- TWICE THE NATION'-----S CURRENT ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, IF COSTS WERE NOT- AN ISSUE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^8 HOWEVER, U.S. WIND RESOURCES ARE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN A FEW- REGIONS (THE NEMS ELECTRICITY REGIONS ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE 2). NEARLY- 60 PERCENT OF ALL U.S. WIND RESOURCES ARE IN THE MAPP REGION, AND NO ECONOMICALLY- USEFUL WIND RESOURCES ARE RECORDED IN FL AND MAIN. FURTHER, NEARLY 90 PERCENT- OF U.S. WIND RESOURCES ARE IN THE LEAST VALUABLE CLASS, CLASS--- THUS,- WHILE PLENTIFUL OVERALL, THE BEST U.S. WIND RESOURCES ARE NOT NECESSARILY- NEAR EITHER POPULATION CONCENTRATIONS OR ELECTRICITY DEMAND CENTERS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FIGURE-------- U.S. WIND SUPPLY---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FIGURE-------- ELECTRICITY MARKET MODEL REGIONS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE SECOND STEP IN THE CHARACTERIZATION LIMITS USABLE WIND ENERGY RESOURCES- TO THOSE SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO EXISTING 115- TO 230-KILOVOLT TRANSMISSION- LINES. THEY FALL WITHIN THREE DISTANCE ZONES (TABLE 4). ALL NEW GENERATING- CAPACITY, REGARDLESS OF TECHNOLOGY TYPE, HAS AN ASSOCIATED STANDARD TRANSMISSION- INTERCONNECTION FEE, WHICH VARIES BY REGION BUT AVERAGES ABOUT $225 PER- KILOWATT. THIS FEE REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE COST OF BUILDING A NEW LINE INTERCONNECTING- THE NEW GENERATING PLANT WITH THE EXISTING NETWORK. IN ADDITION, EXTRA- COSTS AVERAGING $5 PER KILOWATT PER ADDITIONAL MILE ARE ADDED TO ACCOUNT- FOR THE GREATER DISTANCE OF WIND SITES FROM EXISTING TRANSMISSION NETWORKS- (TABLE 4).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TABLE--------- DISTANCE ZONES, MILES FROM WIND RESOURCES TO EXISTING TRANSMISSION------ LINES---------------------------------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, COMPOSITE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS (TABLE 5) ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED- ADDITIONAL COSTS CONFRONTING ACTUAL U.S. WIND DEVELOPMENT. ALL NEW WIND- GENERATING CAPACITY IN EVERY REGION IS SUBJECT TO ONE OF FIVE CAPITAL COST- ADJUSTMENT FACTORS (STEPS). CAPACITY IN THE LEAST-COST STEPS (STEPS 1 AND- 2) CORRESPONDS TO THE DEFINITION OF ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE ENERGY RESERVES.- CAPACITY IN STEPS 1 THROUGH 4 ENCOMPASSES TECHNICALLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES- (AT CURRENT PRICES). ALL CAPACITY (STEPS 1 THROUGH 5) ENCOMPASSES THE TOTAL- WIND RESOURCE BASE.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^9  TABLE--------- U.S. WIND RESOURCES BY REGION AND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTOR---------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS REAPPORTION EACH REGION'-----S TOTAL WIND RESOURCES- SHOWN IN TABLE--- THEY ALLOW AN---------------------------------------------------- INITIAL PORTION OF REGIONAL WIND RESOURCES TO BE BUILT AT-NO INCREASE IN- CAPITAL COSTS, WITH INCREASING PROPORTIONS CONSTRUCTED AT CAPITAL COST- INCREASES OF 20, 50, 100, AND 200 PERCENT ABOVE THE BASE COST.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^10 IN THE- NWP REGION, FOR EXAMPLE, 7.7 GIGAWATTS OF WIND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE- AT THE BASE COST (ITSELF AFFECTED BY OVERALL LEARNING,-CAPACITY FACTOR- CHANGE, ETC.), AN ADDITIONAL 13.2 GIGAWATTS ARE AVAILABLE AT 20 PERCENT- ABOVE BASE COST, 8.6 GIGAWATTS AT 50 PERCENT ABOVE, AND 1.5 GIGAWATTS AT- DOUBLE THE BASE COST. ALL REMAINING RESOURCES OF THE PNL ALLOCATION FOR- NWP (275.2 GIGAWATTS) ARE RELEGATED TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE STEP, STEP 5,- WITH A 200-PERCENT COST INCREASE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  LEARNING-BY-DOING ALSO AFFECTS WIND TECHNOLOGY CAPITAL COSTS. A REGION'-----S- RESULTING WIND TECHNOLOGY CAPITAL-COST DEPENDS BOTH ON THE OVERALL NATIONWIDE- INCREASE IN WIND CAPACITY, WHICH LOWERS CAPITAL COSTS THROUGH LEARNING-BY-DOING- EFFECTS, AND ON THE PROPORTION OF THE REGION'-----S WIND RESOURCES ALREADY USED,- WHICH INCREASES COSTS OF FURTHER PENETRATION.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ARE SUPERIMPOSED ON THE EXISTING REGIONAL TOTALS- SHOWN IN TABLE--- AS A RESULT, THE COST-INCREASING EFFECTS OF THE COST- ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ARE NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED WITHIN WIND CLASSES, BUT- FIRST APPLY TO CLASS 6 WIND RESOURCES UNTIL EITHER THE RESOURCE OR THE- WEIGHTED PROPORTION IS-EXHAUSTED.-EXTENDING THE NWP-EXAMPLE, THE SUBTOTAL- OF ALL 31 GIGAWATTS OF WIND RESOURCES FOR THE REGION, SHOWN IN STEPS- 1-4 OF TABLE 5, ARE OBTAINED FROM THE 70.3 GIGAWATTS OF CLASS 6+ RESOURCES- SHOWN IN TABLE--------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE EFFECT OF THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS IS TO REDISTRIBUTE AVAILABLE- U.S. WIND SUPPLIES. FIGURE 3 SHOWS THE REDISTRIBUTION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.- FIGURE---- 4--AT A MUCH REDUCED SCALE------SHOWS THE REDISTRIBUTION FOR THE NORTHWEST (NWP).------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^11 CLEARLY THE EFFECT OF REALLOCATION IS TO MARKEDLY REDUCE THE QUANTITIES- OF WIND AVAILABLE AT ALL BUT THE HIGHEST COSTS. WHEREAS WIND SUPPLIES UNDER- CLASS 6 DESIGNATION ALONE (TABLE 3) OFFER-NEARLY 102 GIGAWATTS OF-LEAST-COST- WIND SUPPLY, THE-EFFECT OF IMPOSING COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS IS THAT ONLY- 28 GIGAWATTS ARE IN THE LEAST-COST-STEP AND 4--GIGAWATTS IN THE NEXT, TOGETHER- EQUALING ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE-BEST WIND RESOURCES IN THE PNL-BASED ALLOCATION.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FIGURE-------- COMPARING U.S. WIND SUPPLY-ESTIMATES---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FIGURE-------- ELECTRICITY-MARKET MODEL REGIONS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BASIS-FOR WIND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  EVIDENCE FROM EXPERIENCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SEPARATE FROM ISSUES-OF TURBINE-MANUFACTURING COST, THE SUPPOSITION OF- PLENTIFUL U.S. WIND SUPPLIES SUGGESTS RELATIVELY TROUBLE-FREE SITING OF- WIND PLANTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF COMMERCIAL WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER,- ACTUAL U.S. PLANTS PROPOSED OR ENTERING SERVICE IN THE 1990S ARE CONFRONTING- SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL PROJECT COSTS, SUGGESTING THAT UNENCUMBERED U.S.- WIND RESOURCES ARE NOT NECESSARILY-AS PLENTIFUL AS CHARACTERIZED IN GENERAL- COST ESTIMATES.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^12  FIRST, NATURAL PHENOMENA CAN IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON NEW WIND SITES.- TOO STRONG OR OFF-PEAK WINDS, STORMS, FREEZING,-LIGHTNING,-HAIL, VEGETATION,- EROSION, BIRD AND ANIMAL HABITAT REQUIREMENTS, OR OTHER NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS- RAISE COSTS, REDUCE OUTPUT, OR REDUCE WIND'-----S MARKET VALUE. NEW WIND PLANTS- IN MINNESOTA, IOWA, VERMONT, AND WYOMING REQUIRE REINFORCEMENT TO COPE- WITH WINTER STORMS AND HEATING EQUIPMENT TO REMOVE ICE, WHICH DEGRADES- PERFORMANCE AND FORCES OCCASIONAL SHUTDOWNS. TEXAS WIND PLANTS CONFRONT- ADDITIONAL COSTS------ BOTH IN ORIGINAL INSTALLATION-AND IN UNANTICIPATED REPLACEMENTS- AND REPAIRS------FROM VIOLENT WIND STORMS, TORNADOES, HAIL, AND LIGHTNING. IN- THE WEST AND MIDWEST, LATE WINTER AND SPRING PEAK WINDS MISS THE SUMMER- ELECTRICITY PEAKING DEMANDS. IN THE NORTHWEST, WINDS TEND TO BE UNPREDICTABLE.- TERRAIN-SLOPE AND VARIATION ALSO RAISE COSTS AND PRECLUDE DEVELOPING LARGE- PORTIONS OF OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE NEW WIND SITES IN MINNESOTA AND WYOMING.- STEEP, HEAVILY VEGETATED, AND DIFFICULT TERRAIN ELIMINATE MANY PARTS OF- NEW ENGLAND AND NORTHWEST LANDS BECAUSE OF BOTH HIGHER INSTALLATION COSTS- FOR TURBINES, LINES, ROADS, ETC., AND HIGHER MAINTENANCE COSTS. FINALLY,- COPING WITH INSECTS, BIRDS, AND LOCAL ANIMALS CAN RAISE COSTS OR PRECLUDE- CURRENT USE OF OTHERWISE ATTRACTIVE WIND AREAS. INSECTS COAT MIDWESTERN- WIND TURBINE BLADES, DEGRADING PERFORMANCE AND NECESSITATING MORE FREQUENT- BLADE CLEANING, THEREBY REDUCING OUTPUT WHILE INCREASING COSTS. LESSONS- LEARNED FROM BIRD KILLS IN 1980S CALIFORNIA PROJECTS HAS ACCELERATED 1990S- AVOIDANCE OF LESS EXPENSIVE LATTICE TOWERS, ADDITION OF SPECIAL COATINGS- AND MARKINGS ON TURBINES, MEASURES TO DISCOURAGE NESTING, AND IN SOME CASES,- AVOIDANCE OF ATTRACTIVE WINDY AREAS USED BY MIGRATING BIRDS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  SECOND, ALTHOUGH EIA ACCOUNTS FOR COSTS OF INTERCONNECTING NEW WIND PLANTS- TO THE EXISTING TRANSMISSION NETWORK, THE ALREADY LOADED NETWORK IS OFTEN- UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL WIND RESOURCES IN IMPORTANT WIND AREAS,- THEREBY RAISING COSTS AND REDUCING LEAST-COST WIND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.- NORTHERN STATES POWER, OSTENSIBLY AWASH IN WIND RESOURCES RELATIVELY NEAR -TRANSMISSION LINES (TABLE 3),-FINDS THE EXISTING IN-STATE TRANSMISSION- NETWORK LOADED AND UNABLE TO-ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN 425 MEGAWATTS OF WIND- CAPACITY FROM THE SUPPOSEDLY-AMPLE BUFFALO RIDGE WIND AREA.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^13 NEW WIND- PROJECTS IN WYOMING AND IN OREGON FACED SIGNIFICANT COST HURDLES IN UPGRADES- AND POWER TRANSMISSION CHARGES. MAJOR EXPANSION OF WESTERN WIND POWER REQUIRES- SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES OVER A VERY LONG TRANSMISSION CORRIDOR, AND PLENTIFUL- WEST TEXAS AND PANHANDLE WINDS FACE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR WHEELING POWER- TO MAJOR ELECTRIC POWER MARKETS IN CENTRAL TEXAS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  FINALLY, ADDITIONAL MARKET PREFERENCES FOR ALTERNATIVE LAND USE INCREASE- WIND PROJECT COSTS AND PRECLUDE OTHERWISE EXCELLENT WIND POWER PROJECTS,- SUCH AS IN COLUMBIA HILLS AND RATTLESNAKE HILLS (WASHINGTON), BURLINGTON- (VERMONT), AND CAPE COD (MASSACHUSETTS). IN THE WEST AND NORTHWEST, ENVIRONMENTAL,- SCENIC, CULTURAL, AND RELIGIOUS VALUES EFFECTIVELY RESTRICT OR PRECLUDE- WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT. PROTECTION OF BIRDS, OF NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL- AND RELIGIOUS VALUES, AND OF SCENIC VISTAS PLAYS PROMINENTLY IN THE ELIMINATION- OF SEEMINGLY EXCELLENT WIND SITES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  LACK OF DETAILED INFORMATION PRECLUDES SEPARATE REPRESENTATION OF EACH- ADDITIONAL COST IN NEMS. HOWEVER, OBSERVATION OF THEIR EFFECTS ON NEW U.S.- WIND PLANTS------ ALONG WITH NOTICEABLY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED CAPITAL COSTS------LEADS- EIA TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ADDITIONAL FACTORS NEED TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE- WIND COST METHODOLOGY. LITERATURE REVIEWS AND CONTACTS WITH INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS- SHOW THAT EVERY LARGE WIND FACILITY INSTALLED IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE- 1990S HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO AT LEAST SOME OF THE FORCES UNDERLYING THE FACTORS.- MOREOVER, WHEREAS EPRI-DOE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT ACTUAL INSTALLED COSTS- FOR NEW WIND PLANTS SHOULD AVERAGE BELOW $900 PER KILOWATT BY 1999, COSTS- FOR RECENT LARGE INSTALLATIONS APPEAR TO EXCEED $1,200 PER KILOWATT. FOR- EXAMPLE, THE 34-MEGAWATT BIG SPRING PROJECT IN TEXAS, REPORTED AT $40 MILLION,- AVERAGES $1,176 PER KILOWATT; A REPORTED $235 MILLION FOR THE 193-MEGAWATT- WIND FACILITY AT ALTA, IOWA, YIELDS AN AVERAGE COST OF $1,220 PER KILOWATT;- TWO NEW NORTHERN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PROJECTS AT BUFFALO RIDGE IN MINNESOTA- TOTALING 23.1 MEGAWATTS AND $32 MILLION AVERAGE $1,380 PER KILOWATT; AND- THE $60 MILLION 41.4-MEGAWATT FOOTE CREEK PROJECT IN WYOMING YIELDS A COST- OF $1,450 PER KILOWATT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^14 WHILE THESE VALUES MAY INCLUDE SOME COMPONENTS- NOT USUALLY INCLUDED IN OVERNIGHT CAPITAL COST DEFINITIONS, EIA IS NOT- AWARE OF ANY RECENT WIND PROJECT COMPLETED AT LESS THAN $1,000 PER KILOWATT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  EVIDENCE FROM REGIONAL SUPPLY EVALUATIONS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THREE SPECIFIC REGIONAL WIND RESOURCE REVIEWS------IN MINNESOTA, CALIFORNIA,- AND BY THE NORTHWEST POWER PLANNING COUNCIL (NWPPC)------INDICATE THAT ECONOMICALLY- ACCESSIBLE WIND RESOURCES ARE LESS PLENTIFUL THAN INDICATED BY WIND SPEED- AND DISTANCE FROM TRANSMISSION NETWORKS ALONE. THE STUDIES RANGE FROM QUALITATIVE- (MINNESOTA) TO QUANTITATIVE (CALIFORNIA) TO FAIRLY DETAILED (NWPPC).-----------------------------------------------------------------------  IN 1996, MINNESOTA'-----S----- "APPEL REPORT-----" TO THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATIVE ELECTRIC- TASK FORCE CONCLUDED WITH RESPECT TO WIND RESOURCE AREAS THAT----- ". . . MASSIVE- DEVELOPMENT OF WIND AND BIOMASS GENERATION SYSTEMS IN MINNESOTA-WILL REQUIRE- ADDITIONS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM . . . [BECAUSE] MUCH OF THE RENEWABLE- RESOURCE AREA LACKS TRANSMISSION CAPABILITY . . . .-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"^15 THE APPEL REPORT------- ALONG WITH NORTHERN STATES POWER-----`S DIFFICULTY IN SITING MORE THAN 425 MEGAWATTS------IS- THE BASIS FOR SHARPLY RESTRICTING LEAST-COST WIND SUPPLIES IN MAPP AND- OTHER SIMILARLY WELL-ENDOWED WIND RESOURCE REGIONS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE 1991 CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION (CEC) REPORT,--- TECHNICAL POTENTIAL- OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES----, PROVIDES SOME QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION, ESSENTIALLY- PROVIDING A TECHNICAL UPPER BOUND OF----- "REASONABLE-----" WIND POTENTIAL FOR THAT- STATE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^16 WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING A MUCH LARGER PNL ESTIMATE OF 37,000 MEGAWATTS- AS----- "GROSS TECHNICAL POTENTIAL,-----" THE CEC ASSESSMENT OF INDIVIDUAL SITES- CONCLUDES THAT A REASONABLE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR CALIFORNIA IS 4,-460 MEGAWATTS UNDER EXISTING TRANSMISSION CONSTRAINTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^17 LOOSENING THE TRANSMISSION- CONSTRAINTS SOMEWHAT INCREASES THE TOTAL TECHNICAL POTENTIAL TO 5,385 MEGAWATTS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^18 IN EITHER CASE, THE CEC ESTIMATES STAND IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE 20.1 GIGAWATTS- SHOWN IN TABLE--------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE 1996 NWPPC STUDY,--- NORTHWEST POWER IN TRANSITION----, PROVIDES ONE FAIRLY- DETAILED STUDY RELATING WIND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND QUANTITIES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^19 THE NWPPC- STUDY COVERS ONLY THE STATES OF IDAHO, MONTANA, OREGON, AND WASHINGTON.- NEVERTHELESS, IT PROVIDES A USEFUL EXPOSITION OF THE GENERAL SHAPE OF A- LIKELY WIND SUPPLY FUNCTION. FIGURE 4 INCLUDES A REPRESENTATION OF THE- NWPPC VALUES (CONVERTED BY EIA TO CAPITAL COSTS), WITH NWPPC WIND GENERATING- CAPACITIES DOUBLED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LARGER NWP REGION REPRESENTED IN NEMS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE NWPPC WIND SUPPLY FUNCTION IDENTIFIES 10,700 MEGAWATTS OF POTENTIAL- WIND POWER AVAILABLE IN THE FOUR STATES AT A RANGE OF COSTS BELOW 20 CENTS- PER KILOWATTHOUR. FURTHER, THE REPORT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PRIVATE DEVELOPERS- HAVE LIKELY IDENTIFIED OTHER COST-EFFECTIVE SITES, AND THAT STILL OTHER- SITES PROBABLY EXIST,-THOUGH THEY ARE LIKELY SMALL AND BEST SUITED FOR- LOCAL LOADS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE NWPPC SUPPLY ALSO ILLUSTRATES LIMITS TO ACCESSIBILITY FOR WIND POWER.- OF THE TOTAL 10,700 MEGAWATTS, NWPPC ESTIMATES THAT LESS THAN 2,000 MEGAWATTS- COULD BE DEVELOPED AT 6 CENTS PER KILOWATTHOUR OR LESS (1995 DOLLARS) IN- THE ABSENCE OF A NEW TRANSMISSION INTERTIE TO MONTANA. MOREOVER, THE LOW- COSTS WOULD BE ACHIEVED ONLY IF ENOUGH WIND DEVELOPMENT OCCURRED TO DISTRIBUTE- THE HIGH FIXED COSTS OF THE NECESSARY TRANSMISSION UPGRADES. (BECAUSE OF- TYPICALLY LOW CAPACITY FACTORS FOR WIND PROJECTS, THE COST OF AMORTIZING- AN INCREMENT OF NEW TRANSMISSION CAPACITY IS ASSIGNED TO FAR FEWER KILOWATTHOURS- FOR A WIND PROJECT THAN FOR TYPICAL FOSSIL-FUELED PROJECTS, AGAIN RAISING- COSTS FOR WIND-GENERATED POWER.) FINALLY, ALTHOUGH TRANSMISSION REMAINS- THE MOST IMPORTANT LIMITING FACTOR, SITE VIABILITY IS-ALSO LIMITED BY WIND- CHARACTERISTICS, TOPOGRAPHY, WEATHER, ENVIRONMENTAL AND HABITAT CONCERNS,- AND LAND USE CONFLICTS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE MINNESOTA, CEC, AND NWPPC STUDIES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR U.S.- WIND SUPPLY ESTIMATION. FIRST, THEY BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS- ON SOME OF THE MOST-IMPORTANT WIND RESOURCES IN THE NATION. SECOND, THEY- BOTH QUANTIFY OPPORTUNITIES AND IDENTIFY GENERAL REASONS FOR LIMITATIONS- IN ACCESSING WIND RESOURCES. AS SUCH, THEY FORM A VALUABLE BASE FOR EIA'-----S- REPRESENTATION OF U.S. WIND POWER. THE THREE ASSESSMENTS-HAVE LIMITATIONS,- HOWEVER, FOR WIDER APPLICATION. THE NWPPC STUDY CHARACTERIZES ONLY PART--OF THE NEMS NWP REGION. MOREOVER, CALIFORNIA AND THE NORTHWEST------FEATURING- GREAT DISTANCES, LARGE MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, AND SIGNIFICANT SCENIC, CULTURAL,- AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES------MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF IMPORTANT MIDWESTERN- AND SOUTHWESTERN WIND REGIONS FOR WHICH DETAILED INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR U.S. WIND SUPPLY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE FIVE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ARE BROAD APPLICATIONS OF RATES OF COST- INCREASE AND PROPORTIONS OF WIND SUPPLIES DERIVED FROM THE MINNESOTA, CEC,- AND NWPPC WIND RESOURCE INFORMATION.-IN GENERAL, EIA MAKES THE FOLLOWING- ASSUMPTIONS:----------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL ESTIMATES DEVELOPED BY EIA WILL NOT EXCEED ESTIMATES MADE BY AUTHORITATIVE- STUDIES PREPARED BY INDIVIDUAL REGIONS. THEREFORE, THE CEC AND NWPPC RESULTS- SET UPPER BOUNDS ON QUANTITIES AND COSTS OF ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE WIND- RESOURCES FOR THOSE REGIONS. EIA RELAXES THIS ASSUMPTION SOMEWHAT IN THE- NORTHWEST, TO ACCOMMODATE BOTH NWPPC ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ADDITIONAL----- "UNDISCOVERED------" RESOURCES AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE LARGER NEMS REGION.------------------------------------------------------------------------ THERE ARE FEWER ECONOMICALLY ACCESSI----------------------------------------------BLE ONES. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY INDICATES THAT LESS THAN- 1 PERCENT OF ALL TECHNICALLY ACC--------------------------------------------ESSIBLE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGIES HAVE-IMPROVED SINCE THOSE ESTIMATES- WERE MADE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^20 EIA TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT PUBLISHED WIND RESOURCE ESTIMATES- ALREADY EXCLUDE SOME LAND FOR ECONOMIC REASONS AND ASSUMES A MUCH LESS- SEVERE REDUCTION.----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAST-COST WIND RESOURCES IN EVERY REGION ARE ASSUMED TO BE SUFFICIENT- TO MEET FUTURE WIND CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE EIA REFERENCE CASE.----------------------------------------------------------------------- WIND RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR SMALL REGIONS (THOSE WITH FEWER WIND RESOURCES)- ARE ASSUMED TO RESEMBLE THE CEC DISTRIBUTION; WIND DISTRIBUTIONS IN LARGE- REGIONS ARE ASSUMED TO RESEMBLE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NWPPC STUDY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EXAMINING TABLE 3 OR TABLE 5 SHOWS TWO BROAD REGIONAL GROUPS,----- "SMALL-----" WIND- REGIONS WITH RELATIVELY FEW WIND RESOURCES (LESS THAN 25,000-MEGAWATTS)- AND----- "LARGE-----" WIND REGIONS WITH EXTENSIVE WIND RESOURCES (MORE THAN 175,-000 MEGAWATTS). GIVEN THAT CNV FALLS IN THE----- "SMALL-----" CATEGORY AND NWP IN THE------ "LARGE,-----" EIA FIRST ESTABLISHED DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CNV AND NWP AND THEN BROADLY -APPLIED THOSE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OTHER REGIONS. AS A RESULT, ECAR, MAAC,- NY, NE, AND STV FOLLOW-THE CNV EXAMPLE, WHILE MAPP, SPP, AND RA FOLLOW- THE NWP DISTRIBUTION. BECAUSE ITS WINDS ARE CONSIDERED GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE,- ERCOT IS TREATED AS A SPECIAL CASE OF A SMALL WIND REGION, WITH HIGHER- PROPORTIONS OF ITS WINDS IN LOWER COST CATEGORIES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  EIA EMPLOYS FIVE DISCRETE COST STEPS. STEPS 1 AND 2 REPRESENT TWO COST- LEVELS FOR WIND-RESERVES, EITHER ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE NOW OR IN THE- VERY NEAR FUTURE. RESERVES PLUS-HIGHER COST STEPS 3 AND 4 YIELD TECHNICALLY- ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES, THOSE WHICH COULD REASONABLY BECOME RESERVES BY------- STEP 5 REPRESENTS THAT PART OF WIND RESOURCES WHICH-EIA DOES NOT CONSIDER- ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE BY 2020 UNDER ANY NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE TECHNICAL- POTENTIAL OF 4,460 MEGAWATTS SET BY CEC, FOR EXAMPLE, BECOMES THE CONTROL- TOTAL FOR STEPS 1 THROUGH 4 IN THE EIA DISTRIBUTION.------------------------------------------------------------------------ EIA DERIVES STEPS -, 3, AND 4 FROM TWO SOURCES. FIRST, TO BE USEFUL, EACH- OF THE COST STEPS NEEDS TO SHOW MEANINGFUL COST INCREASES; THEREFORE, EIA- CHOSE EACH STEP TO CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATE MAJOR COST CLASSES. SECOND, PARTICULARLY- FOR THE INITIAL STEPS, EIA VERY BROADLY APPLIED COST BREAKS EXHIBITED IN- THE NWPPC SUPPLY. FINALLY, EIA CHOSE THE 200-PERCENT INCREASE (STEP 5)- TO SEPARATE RESOURCES DETERMINED EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY TO BE ECONOMICALLY- ACCESSIBLE. ALL PNL WIND RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NORTHWEST IN EXCESS- OF THE NWPPC AND CEC ESTIMATES (AS ADJUSTED BY EIA) ARE ASSIGNED THE 200-PERCENT- INCREASE; SIMILAR PROPORTIONS ARE THEN APPLIED TO THE PNL ESTIMATES FOR- OTHER REGIONS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SMALL REGIONS: ADAPTING CEC INFORMATION TO ECAR, MAAC, NY, NE, AND SERC--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- USING THE CEC TOTAL AS AN APPROXIMATE UPPER BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA'-----S TECHNICALLY- ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES, EIA ASSIGNS 4,522 MEGAWATTS AS THE TOTAL OF STEPS- 1-4 AND THE REMAINING 15,585 MEGAWATTS TO STEP--- OF THE 4, 522 MEGAWATTS,- 1,710 MEGAWATTS REPRESENTING ALREADY INSTALLED WIND GENERATING CAPACITY- ARE ASSIGNED TO STEP 1 (RESERVES). IN ORDER TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR- LEAST-COST GROWTH AND EXPANSION IN THE OTHER COST CATEGORIES------BUT WITH NO- INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION------EIA ALLOCATES THE REMAINING- 2,812 MEGAWATTS EQUALLY ACROSS THE 4 TECHNICALLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCE STEPS.- IN EFFECT, THE CEC ALLOCATION PLACES ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF WIND RESOURCES- IN THE LOWEST COST STEP AND ABOUT 80 PERCENT IN STEP--------------------------------------------------------------------------- OTHER----- "SMALL-----" WIND RESOURCE REGIONS ARE SIMILAR BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO CNV.- THE CNV ALLOCATION IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE OF THE LARGE ALREADY-BUILT COMPONENT- AND THE INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINED CEC BOUND. THEREFORE, FOR OTHER SMALL- REGIONS, A SLIGHTLY LOWER PROPORTION OF TOTAL WIND RESOURCES IS ASSIGNED- TO STEP 1 AND HIGHER PROPORTIONS ARE ASSIGNED TO STEPS--- 2-FURTHER, RECOGNIZING- THAT U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND OTHER ENERGY RESOURCE CHARACTERIZATIONS- SHOW INCREASING RESOURCE PROPORTIONS AT HIGHER COSTS, EIA GENERALLY INCREASES- THE WIND RESOURCE PROPORTIONS FOR SMALL REGIONS AS COSTS INCREASE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^21 FINALLY,- FOR ALL SMALL REGIONS EXCEPT CNV, EIA INCREASES THE FOUR LOWER COST STEP- SHARES TO OFFSET THE USE OF AVERAGE RATHER THAN MARGINAL COSTS (SEE BELOW).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  LARGE REGIONS: ADAPTING THE NWPPC ESTIMATES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BEFORE APPLYING THE NWPPC RESULTS TO OTHER REGIONS, EIA FIRST ADAPTS THEM- TO THE LARGER NWP GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND THEN ADJUSTS THEM TO REFLECT THE- USE OF AVERAGE COST STEPS RATHER THAN A CONTINUOUS COST FUNCTION. FIRST,- EIA DOUBLED THE NWPPC WIND SUPPLY ESTIMATE FOR EACH SUPPLY STEP. THE NWP- REGION IN NEMS IS ROUGHLY TWICE THE GEOGRAPHIC SIZE OF THE NWPPC REGION- (FIGURE 2). ALTHOUGH THE ADDITIONAL STATES IN NWP (NEVADA, UTAH, AND THE- WESTERN HALF OF WYOMING) ARE LESS WELL ENDOWED WITH WIND RESOURCES THAN- THE NWPPC REGION, NEVERTHELESS, THE NWPPC BELIEVES ITS REGION ALSO CONTAINS- ADDITIONAL UNDISCOVERED WIND RESOURCES NOT INCLUDED IN ITS PUBLISHED WIND- SUPPLY. THEREFORE, TO AVOID UNDERESTIMATING TOTAL WIND RESOURCES IN THE- NWP REGION, EIA DOUBLED THE NWPPC WIND SUPPLY ESTIMATES------FROM OVER 10,-000 MEGAWATTS TO NEARLY 21,000 MEGAWATTS------AS AN ESTIMATE OF ALL ECONOMICALLY- ACCESSIBLE WIND IN NWP STEPS-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1- SECOND, FOR BOTH SMALL AND LARGE WIND RESOURCE REGIONS, EIA INCREASES THE- LOWER COST SUPPLIES TO OFFSET CONSEQUENCES OF EMPLOYING AVERAGE COSTS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IS TO OVERSTATE THE--- MARGINAL---- COSTS OF THE FIRST UNITS WITHIN-EACH RANGE.- OVERSTATING MARGINAL COSTS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF- PREVENTING INITIAL PURCHASES AND THEREBY PRECLUDING THE-ENTIRE PATH OF- INVESTMENT, LEARNING, LOWER COSTS, AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. TO COMPENSATE- FOR SUCH OVERPRICING,-EIA REALLOCATES PORTIONS OF CAPACITY FROM HIGHER- COST STEPS TO LOWER COST ONES, INCLUDING SOME SUPPLY FROM STEP 5 INTO STEP- 4, AND THEREBY INCREASES TOTAL WIND SUPPLY IN STEPS 1-4 TO NEARLY 31,-000 MEGAWATTS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE EFFECT OF BOTH EIA ADJUSTMENTS TO NWPPC WIND RESOURCES IS TO GREATLY- INCREASE LOWER COST WIND-SUPPLIES IN NWP RELATIVE TO THE NWPPC ESTIMATES.- WHEREAS NWPPC HAS LESS THAN 2,-00 MEGAWATTS OF LEAST-COST WIND SUPPLIES- (INCLUDING SOME WINDS IN THE BLACKFOOT WIND RESOURCE AREA), EIA ASSIGNS- 7,653 MEGAWATTS TO STEP 1 FOR THE NWP REGION. WHEREAS-THE NWPPC ESTIMATES- YIELD LESS THAN 11,000 MEGAWATTS FOR--- ALL---- NWPPC WIND RESOURCES, EIA INCLUDES- NEARLY 21,000 MEGAWATTS FOR NWP RESERVES AND NEARLY 31,000 MEGAWATTS FOR- ALL NWP TECHNICALLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES IN STEPS-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1- THE NWPPC ALLOCATION IS APPLIED TO THE WIND-RICH MAPP, SPP, AND RA REGIONS,- ALTHOUGH STEPS 2-4 ARE ASSIGNED INCREASING QUANTITIES AT HIGHER COSTS TO- REFLECT THE NORMAL SHAPE OF SUPPLY FUNCTIONS. STEP 1 IS ALSO REDUCED TO- REFLECT THE SCALE OF LIMITATIONS ON TRANSMISSION ACCESS DEMONSTRATED BY- THE NORTHERN STATES POWER EXPERIENCE AT BUFFALO RIDGE. IN EFFECT, THE NWPPC- ALLOCATION PLACES LESS THAN 3 PERCENT OF WIND RESOURCES IN THE LOWEST COST -STEP-AND MORE THAN 80 PERCENT IN STEP---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE ERCOT SPECIAL CASE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ERCOT, COVERING MAJOR PORTIONS OF TEXAS, IS HANDLED SEPARATELY. THE ELECTRICALLY- INTEGRATED ERCOT REGION EXCLUDES MOST OF THE EXCELLENT WINDS IN THE WESTERN- AND PANHANDLE AREAS OF TEXAS. AS A RESULT, ERCOT BECOMES A SMALL WIND RESOURCE- REGION, WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF WIND RESOURCES IN TOTAL. ON- THE OTHER HAND, BOTH ERCOT TERRAIN AND MARKET CONDITIONS APPEAR EXCELLENT- FOR WIND DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, EIA HAS ASSIGNED ERCOT A UNIQUE WIND SUPPLY- FUNCTION OFFERING MODERATE WIND VOLUMES AT LOW-COSTS (15 PERCENT IN STEP- 1) AND GROWING SHARES AT INTERMEDIATE HIGHER COSTS, BUT WITH ONLY 7 PERCENT- IN THE HIGHEST COST STEP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WIND PROJECTIONS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RECENT EIA FORECASTS ILLUSTRATE APPLICATION OF THE WIND COST ADJUSTMENT- FACTORS. TABLE---SHOWS EIA PROJECTIONS FOR U.S. WIND GENERATING CAPACITY- IN 2020, BY REGION, FROM THE REFERENCE AND HIGH RENEWABLES CASES OF THE---- ANNUAL ENERGY OUTLOOK---- 1999 (---AEO----99) AND IN A CASE TAKEN FROM------------------------------------------------------------- IMPACTS OF- THE KYOTO PROTOCOL ON U.S. ENERGY MARKETS AND ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY------------------------------------------------------------------- (---KYOTO- PROTOCOL----)----.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^22  TABLE--- U.S. REGIONAL WIND GENERATING CAPACITY IN VARIOUS CASES,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS HAVE NO EFFECT ON WIND GENERATING CAPACITY- BUILDS IN THE REFERENCE CASE IN--- AEO--------IN MOST REGIONS, WIND CAPACITY THOUGH- 2020 REMAINS WELL BELOW THE LIMITS OF STEP 1, THE FIRST LEVEL OF RESERVES,- ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS WHERE WIND DEVELOPMENT IS MOST LIKELY (THE MIDWEST,- MOST OF THE WEST, AND TEXAS). CALIFORNIA, ALSO A LIKELY WIND DEVELOPMENT- AREA, APPROACHES FIRST-STEP RESERVES-LIMITS BY ------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE--- AEO----99 HIGH RENEWABLES CASE, IN WHICH EIA ASSUMES THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY- TECHNOLOGIES HAVE LOWER COSTS THAN IN THE REFERENCE CASE, ILLUSTRATES THE- EFFECT OF THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ON WIND PENETRATION.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^23 IN THIS CASE- THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS APPEAR TO HAVE NO EFFECT ON MOST REGIONS, INCLUDING- THE MIDWEST, NORTHWEST, AND ERCOT. HOWEVER, IN CALIFORNIA (CNV) AND IN- RA, WIND CAPACITY IS PROJECTED TO BE BUILT DESPITE THE 20 PERCENT-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGHER COSTS ASSUMED FOR STEP 3 PREVENT ADDITIONAL WIND CAPACITY GROWTH- IN THE CNV REGION.------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE--- KYOTO PROTOCOL---- 1990-7% CASE, IN WHICH ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS CHOOSE- LARGE VOLUMES OF BIOMASS AND WIND RENEWABLES IN ORDER TO MEET MAJOR U.S.- CARBON REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS, CAN BE SEEN AS AN----- "EXTREME-----" CASE. RESULTS- OF THE CASE SHOW-THAT THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS CAN HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS- IN CASES OF HIGH-DEMAND FOR-RENEWABLES,-BOTH LIMITING WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT- AND ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER ELECTRICITY PRICES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT- VERY LARGE INCREASES-IN DEMAND FOR WIND POWER COULD EXHAUST ECONOMICALLY- ACCESSIBLE WIND RESOURCES IN SOME REGIONS. DESPITE THE TECHNOLOGY COST- REDUCTIONS FROM EXPANSION-OF WIND POWER NATIONWIDE, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS- IN SOME REGIONS (ECAR, MAAC, AND STV) RESULT IN-INSTALLED WIND COSTS APPROACHING- $1,800 PER KILOWATT BY------ IN CALIFORNIA, ALL TECHNICALLY ACCESSIBLE- RESOURCES (STEPS---4) ARE USED AND SOME STEP 5 RESOURCES ARE SELECTED.- IN MOST REGIONS, ALL LEAST-COST RESERVES ARE EXHAUSTED. NEVERTHELESS, EVEN- IN THIS VERY DEMANDING CASE, REGIONS WITH LARGE WIND RESOURCES APPEAR CAPABLE- OF COMPLYING WITHOUT LARGE COST INCREASES. FOR SUCH REGIONS, THE NET RESULT- OF LEARNING-EFFECTS AND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS IS TO LOWER WIND POWER- COSTS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ISSUES IN EIA WIND CAPITAL COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  GIVEN THE LIMITED INFORMATION AVAILABLE, EIA'-----S WIND CAPITAL COST ADJUSTMENT- FACTORS APPEAR-TO YIELD PLAUSIBLE PORTRAYALS OF INCREASED COSTS WITH VERY- LARGE INCREASES IN WIND POWER DEMAND. HOWEVER, THEY ALSO HAVE IMPORTANT- LIMITATIONS, PARTICULARLY WHEN ANALYSES INVOLVE MAJOR GROWTH OF WIND POWER.- ALTHOUGH EIA IS CONFIDENT THAT INSTALLED COSTS INCREASE AS WIND RESOURCES- ARE-CONSUMED, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE--- RATE---- OF COST- INCREASES, THE ---EXTENT---- OF COST INCREASES, AND--- INTERREGIONAL DIFFERENCES----- IN WIND TECHNOLOGY COSTS. THE MOST SERIOUS ISSUE AFFECTING THE WIND CAPITAL- COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS IS THE-LACK OF BASIC DATA ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF- WIND TECHNOLOGY COST CHANGE AS WIND RESOURCES ARE USED. LACK OF BASIC COST- INFORMATION CHALLENGES EVERY STAGE OF WIND CAPACITY FORECASTING, INCLUDING- BOTH REFERENCE CASE PROJECTIONS WITH RELATIVELY SMALL CAPACITY INCREASES- AND CASES OF-HIGH RENEWABLE ENERGY-DEMAND. MUCH MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED- ON THE COMPONENTS OF WIND TECHNOLOGY COST INCREASES, DISTINGUISHING NATURAL- RESOURCE ISSUES FROM TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION AND FROM MARKET ISSUES.- FEATURES AND COSTS OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS, FOR EXAMPLE,- MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND MAY BE USEFULLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM- OTHER FORCES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  WIND RESOURCE ESTIMATES FOR ERCOT AND CALIFORNIA ARE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC,- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE REGIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANTS IN WIND ENERGY- MARKETS. THE CHALLENGE WITH ERCOT IS IN DETERMINING WHETHER ITS VAST WIND- SUPPLIES ARE REALLY AVAILABLE IN LARGE QUANTITIES AT CONSTANT COSTS, OR- WHETHER AND AT WHAT POINTS LIMITING FACTORS------SUCH AS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION------EXIST.- THE CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA IS IN RECONCILING CEC RESOURCE ESTIMATES WITH- AMOUNTS OF ALREADY DEVELOPED CAPACITY, WHILE RETAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR- ADDITIONAL WIND POWER GROWTH. EIA IS WORKING WITH ANALYSTS IN BOTH REGIONS- TO DETERMINE IMPROVED FACTORS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  EIA'-----S CURRENT APPROACH SUPERIMPOSES THE COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS ONTO THE- EXISTING WIND CLASS AND DISTANCE METHODOLOGY IN NEMS. IN EFFECT, EIA ASSUMES- THAT THE BEST AND CLOSEST WINDS ARE ALSO THOSE EXEMPT FROM OR LEAST AFFECTED- BY NATURAL RESOURCE, TRANSMISSION ACCESS, AND MARKET FORCES. THE HIGHER- COSTS ARE ASSIGNED TO LOWER CLASS, MORE DISTANT, AND LESS LIKELY SELECTED- WIND REGIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CALIFORNIA, ALL 4.5 GIGAWATTS IN STEPS- 1-4 (TABLE 5) ARE FROM THE STATE'-----S CLASS 6 WIND RESOURCE BASE (TABLE 3). IN- REALITY, THE FACTORS UNDOUBTEDLY AFFECT ALL WIND CLASSES AT ALL DISTANCES.- THE RESULT OF THIS PRACTICE IS TO UNDERSTATE THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SOME- PORTIONS OF U.S. WIND RESOURCES. EIA IS CONSIDERING MEASURES TO AMELIORATE- THESE EFFECTS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CONCLUSION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE ISSUE OF WIND POWER OPPORTUNITY IS LIKELY TO BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT- IN DETERMINING FUTURE U.S. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. UNDERSTANDING WIND PROSPECTS- IS IMPORTANT IN EXPECTED----- "NORMAL-----" ENERGY FUTURES AS WELL AS FOR POSSIBLE- EXCEPTIONAL ONES. AS WIND TURBINE COSTS DECLINE AND THEIR PERFORMANCE IMPROVES,- THE EXTENT TO WHICH WIND RESOURCES, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS,- AND MARKET FORCES COMPLEMENT OR OFFSET THESE IMPROVEMENTS BECOMES ALL THE- MORE PERTINENT FOR NEAR AND MID-TERM ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. IF THESE ADDITIONAL- FACTORS HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE, THEN IMPROVED WIND TECHNOLOGIES MAY ENJOY- FAIRLY RAPID PENETRATION IN NORMAL U.S. ELECTRICITY MARKETS. TO THE EXTENT- THAT ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE WIND RESOURCES ARE SOON EXHAUSTED, NETWORKS- ARE FULL, OR-MARKETS ARE RESISTANT, HOWEVER, WIND POWER MAY FIND ITSELF- STILL A MARGINAL SOURCE OF ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  UNDERSTANDING ACTUAL WIND PROSPECTS BECOMES ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT IN ASSESSING- PROPOSED CHANGES IN NATIONAL POLICY THAT COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE- DEMAND FOR WIND POWER. RELATIVELY GENEROUS WIND RESOURCE SUPPLIES COULD- MAKE POLICY CHOICES THAT FAVOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES MORE ATTRACTIVE- AND LESS COSTLY. RESTRICTED WIND RESOURCE SUPPLIES, IN CONTRAST, COULD- PORTEND MUCH HIGHER ELECTRICITY PRICES, GREATER DEMANDS AND IMPACTS ON- CONSUMERS, AND GREATER IMPACTS ON OVERALL U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  EIA'-----S USE OF WIND COST ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FORMALLY RECOGNIZES THE EXISTENCE- AND IMPORTANCE OF ADDITIONAL FORCES SPECIFIC TO WIND TECHNOLOGY IN ASSESSING- U.S. WIND ENERGY SUPPLIES. MOREOVER, THEY APPEAR TO ACCOUNT IN ROUGH FASHION- FOR THE SCALE OF EFFECTS OF SUCH FACTORS ON U.S. WIND POWER COST. NEVERTHELESS,- THE IMPORTANCE OF WIND RESOURCE EFFECTS ON OVERALL U.S. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY- HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR IMPROVED INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION---- RELATING TO ANY OF OUR REPORTS-VIA E-MAIL, CLICK ON THE LINK LABELED------------------------------------------------------------ "PROJECTIONS LISTSERV---------" TO JOIN---- BY ENTERING YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
