MALCOLM, PH.D---------------.-------------------- (PUBLISHED IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORM AS----- "REENGINEERING CORPORATE--------- TRAINING-----" IN--- TRAINING----, AUGUST 1992, PP. 57-61)------------- THINK BACK FOR A MOMENT TO THE DAY YOU STARTED YOUR CURRENT JOB, OR ANY--------- OTHER JOB FOR THAT MATTER. DESPITE ANY FORMAL TRAINING YOU MAY HAVE RECEIVED--------- PRIOR TO STARTING, DID YOU FEEL FULLY COMPETENT? FIFTY PERCENT COMPETENT?--------------------- OR PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. OF THE SKILLS YOU NOW RECOGNIZE AS CRITICAL TO--------- SUCCESS IN YOUR JOB, WHAT PERCENT OF THEM DID YOU-LEARN IN A FORMAL, TRADITIONAL ---------(READ-CLASSROOM)-SETTING? I'LL BET THE PERCENTAGE IS PRETTY SMALL. IN--------- FACT, NUMEROUS SOURCES PEG THE AVERAGE AT SOMETHING LESS THAN 20 PERCENT.--------- DATA ON SPENDING FOR-EDUCATION BY US BUSINESSES SUGGEST A-SIMILAR PROPORTION,--------- 17 PERCENT TRADITIONAL; THE REST OCCURRING ON THE JOB, SOMEHOW.-------------- OKAY, SO 80 PERCENT OR MORE OF CRITICAL JOB SKILL LEARNING OCCURS ON--------- THE JOB. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT MOST OJT PROGRAMS? WELL, FOR STARTERS,--------- "PROGRAMS" IS OFTEN AN OVERSTATEMENT. TYPICAL OJT IS UNSTRUCTURED OR UNDERSTRUCTURED,--------- INCONSISTENT, AND SLOW. HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU HEARD ACCEPTED TIME-TO-COMPETENCY--------- FIGURES OF 18 MONTHS OR LONGER? IN THE LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE INDUSTRY--------- AVERAGE IS 75 PERCENT TURNOVER OF THE SALES FORCE IN THE FIRST 36 MONTHS.--------- NOW THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE REVOLVING DOOR. WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS FOR CRITICAL--------- JOBS IN YOUR BUSINESS? DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF ANNUAL TURNOVER - LOOK--------- AT THE PERIOD OF TIME IT TAKES TO AT LEAST BREAK EVEN ON YOUR INVESTMENT--------- IN RECRUITING AND DEVELOPMENT TO COMPETENT PERFORMANCE.-------------- NOW SHIFT GEARS FOR A MOMENT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS-OF REENGINEERING--------- WORK, AS DESCRIBED BY-MIKE HAMMER. THE ESSENCE OF THE CASE IS THAT FOR ---------YEARS AND YEARS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING BANDAIDS ON OLD WORK PROCESSES - MORE--------- AND MORE MANAGEMENT LAYERS, FUNCTIONAL UNITS, AND AUTOMATED TRADITIONAL--------- PROCESSES - IN THE SEARCH FOR PERCENTAGE POINT IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY.--------- REENGINEERING SAYS LET'S TAKE A CLEAN SLATE APPROACH; DESIGNING THE WORK--------- AND SYSTEMS TOGETHER TO SEEK ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY,--------- NOT INCREMENTAL CHANGE. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A GOAL. TEN TIMES GREATER--------- PRODUCTIVITY, NOT A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS. AND THERE ARE ENOUGH EXAMPLES----------IN THE LITERATURE-TODAY TO SAY THAT IT CAN WORK. IT MAY NOT BE EASY--------- - MINDS DULLED TO-THE POSSIBILITY OF-MEANINGFUL CHANGE, AND AN ENTRENCHED,--------- THREATENED BUREAUCRACY WILL WORK AGAINST YOU - BUT REENGINEERING WORKS.--------------------- WHAT IF-WE WERE TO-SET OUT TO REENGINEER CORPORATE LEARNING? WHAT DOES--------- PRODUCTIVITY MEAN-FOR US? IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE TWO OBJECTIVES: TO MINIMIZE--------- THE TIME IT TAKES FOR STAFF TO BECOME COMPETENT, AND TO STRIVE FOR HIGHER--------- LEVELS OF COMPETENT PERFORMANCE THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST.-------------- FINALLY WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT, AND IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS. HOW CAN--------- WE POSSIBLY HOPE FOR ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENTS IN COMPETENCY IF--------- WE BARELY INFLUENCE THE 80 OR MORE PERCENT OF LEARNING THAT ALWAYS HAS--------- OCCURRED, AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL OCCUR, ON THE JOB?-------------- AS STEP ONE, I'D PROPOSE THAT WE BEGIN DESIGNING WHAT I'LL CALL THE--------- "100 PERCENT LEARNING EVENT". I'D DEFINE THAT AS ONE THAT INCLUDES SOME TRADITIONAL--------- ELEMENTS AND A WHOLE LOT OF SUPPORT FOR APPLICATION OF SKILLS ON THE JOB.--------- A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO SAY THAT THE LEARNING "EVENT" ISN'T OVER UNTIL--------- THE SKILL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED-TO REAL WORK.-------------- THIS HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING IMPLICATIONS FOR EVALUATION. FOR ONE THING,--------- IT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE LEARNING AT ALL, YOU CAN MEASURE TASK--------- PERFORMANCE. FOR ANOTHER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE TASK PERFORMANCE;--------- THAT'S THE MANAGER'S JOB. . . BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO-THAT.-------------- STEP TWO, ONCE YOU'VE BOUGHT INTO THE NOTION OF THE 100 PERCENT EVENT,--------- IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES TO THE OLD PARADIGM OF FILLING--------- PEOPLE UP WITH SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE AND THEN PUTTING THEM TO WORK. A SERIES--------- OF MORE OR LESS SYNONYMOUS TERMS, LIKE "PROBLEM-CENTERED LEARNING", OR--------- "ACTION LEARNING", OR "ISSUE-CENTERED LEARNING", ALL DESCRIBE A 180 DEGREE--------- SHIFT FROM THE OLD PARADIGM. NOW WE CAN TALK-ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK--------- IMMEDIATELY, OR AT LEAST MUCH SOONER, AND SUPPORTING THEIR LEARNING AS--------- THEY PERFORM THEIR JOBS. A NUMBER OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS HAVE-TAKEN THIS-APPROACH,--------- AND I'VE HEARD OF IT IN SOME MBA PROGRAMS.-------------- TAKE THE MEDICAL SCHOOL EXAMPLE. THE OLD PARADIGM FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINING----------WAS A YEAR-OR TWO OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY COURSES-BEFORE STUDENTS EVER----------SAW A PATIENT. THE PROBLEM-CENTERED APPROACH HAS THEM SEEING PATIENTS--------- - IN TEAMS, WITH A PHYSICIAN COACH - IN THEIR FIRST SEMESTER. THEY LEARN--------- THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, BUT THEY DO SO IN THE COURSE OF SOLVING REAL--------- WORLD, DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS. THE RESULTS SO FAR HAVE BEEN PHYSICIANS WHO--------- ARE RECOGNIZABLY BETTER DIAGNOSTICIANS - WHO HAVE-A LITTLE MORE TROUBLE--------- PASSING THEIR BOARD-EXAMS. BUT-I ASK YOU, WHICH KIND OF PHYSICIAN WOULD--------- YOU RATHER HAVE TREATING YOU, THE ONE WHO GOT HIGHER MARKS ON EXAMS OR--------- THE ONE WHO GETS IT RIGHT WHEN IT COUNTS?-------------- NOW THINGS START TO GET REALLY INTERESTING. IF YOU APPLY THE NOTION OF--------- PROBLEM-CENTERED LEARNING IN CORPORATE SETTING, YOU BEGIN TO DEFINE "EVENTS---------" WHICH HAVE REAL WORK OUTCOMES, AND LEARNING AS A SECONDARY - BUT DESIRED--------- AND LIKELY - OUTCOME. NOW STAFF ARE COMING TO THE CLASSROOM, OR THE "CLASSROOM---------" IS COMING TO THEM, WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT BEFORE THEY'RE DONE THEY WILL--------- HAVE COMPLETED SOME REAL WORK TASK. BELIEVE ME, THAT EXPECTATION ALONE--------- DOES A LOT TO BANISH THE NOTIONS OF LEARNING AS A VACATION, OR OF STUDENTS--------- ASSUMING THEY'LL BE "TAUGHT" WHILE THEY SIT PASSIVELY BY.-------------- ALSO, IF YOU START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT AT THE END OF YOUR 100 PERCENT--------- LEARNING EVENT, EACH PERSON WILL WALK AWAY WITH A REAL WORK PRODUCT, EVALUATION--------- OF SKILL APPLICATION BECOMES A FAR MORE MANAGEABLE TASK. IN THE OLD PARADIGM--------- OF FILL 'EM UP AND SEND THEM AWAY TO THEIR JOBS TO APPLY THEIR SKILLS,--------- EVALUATION IS A CONSTANT FRUSTRATION. WE TEND-TO DO ONE OF SEVERAL THINGS.--------- WE SOMETIMES MEASURE-"LEARNING"-AT THE END OF OUR TRADITIONAL EVENT. SOMETIMES--------- WE DON'T EVEN DO THAT, FOR REASONS THAT WILL BECOME APPARENT. EITHER WAY,--------- WE STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM OF EITHER TRYING TO INFER STUDENTS' ABILITY--------- TO APPLY SKILLS FROM A MEASURE OF WHAT-THEY LEARN, OR OF GOING BACK AT--------- SOME POINT-IN THE FUTURE - THREE TO SIX-MONTHS BEING TYPICAL-- AND ASKING--------- ABOUT APPLICATION ON THE JOB.-------------- NEITHER IS VERY-SATISFYING. WHY? IT COMES BACK TO THE 80/20 SPLIT. IF--------- YOU'RE ONLY INFLUENCING 20 PERCENT OR LESS OF COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT,--------- THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN GO WRONG OUTSIDE OF YOUR CONTROL. IF STUDENTS FAIL--------- TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE OR SKILLS, YOU HAVE TO FEEL THAT YOU'VE FAILED. AND--------- EVEN IF THEY DO SUCCEED IN APPLICATION, DOWN DEEP CAN YOU REALLY TAKE--------- THE CREDIT? WHAT CRAFTSMAN-COULD TAKE SATISFACTION IN DOING ONLY 20 PERCENT--------- OF THE JOB?-------------- ON THE OTHER HAND, APPLICATION IS INTRINSIC TO PROBLEM-CENTERED DESIGNS.--------- YOU'LL KNOW, AND BETTER STILL MANAGEMENT WILL KNOW, THAT STUDENTS HAVE--------- SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED NEW SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE BY THE END OF THE EVENT.--------- HOW? SIMPLY BY EXAMINING THE WORK PRODUCTS. AND THAT EXPLAINS MY EARLIER--------- POINT. IT'S NO LONGER NECESSARY TO MEASURE LEARNING WHEN-YOU'VE GOT-A--------- DIRECT MEASURE OF APPLIED PERFORMANCE. AND WHO BETTER TO DO THE MEASUREMENT--------- THAN MANAGERS, WHO HAVE THE MOST DIRECT STAKE IN THE RESULTS AND THE CLEAREST--------- VIEW OF PERFORMANCE. BESIDES, I'D ARGUE THAT EVEN THE BEST MEASURES OF--------- TRAINING ROI, IF MEASURED BY TRAINERS, ARE VIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AS SUSPECT--------- FOR THEIR POTENTIAL TO BE SELF-SERVING. THEY'RE ANALOGOUS TO THE "SCIENTIFIC--------- RESULTS" ADVERTISERS USE TO SELL US THIS PRODUCT OR THAT. INSTEAD, GIVE--------- MANAGERS THE MEANS TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE GAINS, AND LET THEM SPREAD THE--------- NEWS-OF YOUR JOINT SUCCESS.-------------- ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF PROBLEM-CENTERED LEARNING IS THAT IT OFFERS--------- THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS COMPETENCIES AND SUB-DISCIPLINES--------- THAT MAKE UP ANY OF TODAY'S COMPLEX JOBS.-TAKE THE JOB OF CASUALTY CLAIM--------- REPRESENTATIVE FOR EXAMPLE. THE JOB CENTERS ON THE-TECHNICAL SKILLS REQUIRED--------- TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS. BUT PERFORMING IT WELL REQUIRES INTEGRATING COMPUTER--------- SKILLS - USING AETNA'S CLAIM SYSTEMS; INTERPERSONAL SKILLS TO DEAL PROFESSIONALLY--------- WITH CLAIMANTS, AGENTS, LAWYERS, AND OTHERS; AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SKILLS--------- - BECAUSE AVERAGE CASE LOADS FOR CLAIM REPRESENTATIVES RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS.--------- TEACHING SYSTEMS IN ISOLATION FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE TASKS THEY SUPPORT,--------- OR TEACHING THE SKILLS TO INVESTIGATE ONE CLAIM WHEN THE NEED IS TO LEARN--------- HOW TO MANAGE MANY SIMULTANEOUSLY, LEAVE NEW STAFF ILL-PREPARED TO FACE--------- THE REALITIES OF DAILY JOB EXPECTATIONS. PROBLEM-CENTERED DESIGNS ARE--------- A NATURAL MEANS-TO ACCOMPLISH THE COMPETENCY INTEGRATION CRITICAL TO SUCCESS--------- ON THE JOB. AT AETNA, OUR-INTERACTIVE VIDEO "WHOLE-JOB SIMULATIONS" DO--------- JUST THAT. I CAN'T ELABORATE HERE, BUT THE WAY THEY WORK IS THAT A SMALL--------- GROUP OF NEW CLAIM REPS GATHER TO WORK THROUGH THE CASE IN COMPUTER-SIMULATION,----------SUPPORTED BY A CLAIM TRAINER OR SUPERVISOR. AT EVERY DECISION POINT OPTIONS----------ARE DISCUSSED AND--WAR STORIES- ARE SHARED. THE RESULT IS AN INCREDIBLY--------- RICH EXPERIENCE SHARING IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF-TIME. (FOR-MORE DETAILS,----------SEE--WHOLE JOB SIMULATION" IN CBT DIRECTIONS, JULY, 1991, PP 27-30.)-------------- THERE'S ANOTHER TERM I-CONSIDERED-LISTING AS A SEMI-SYNONYM OF PROBLEM-CENTERED--------- LEARNING, AND THAT'S PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.-MORE SPECIFICALLY "ELECTRONIC--------- PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS" AS ARTICULATED SO WELL BY GLORIA GERY IN----------HER BOOK OF THE SAME NAME. ELECTRONIC OR NOT, THE IDEA IS TO PUT PEOPLE--------- TO WORK AND PROVIDE WHATEVER SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO PERFORM COMPETENTLY--------- - WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE COMPETENT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE OF THE TERM.--------- TYPICAL SUPPORTS ARE TASK STRUCTURING, AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION, ADVICE,--------- AND LEARNING. THE LEARNING IS USUALLY IN THE FORM OF "GRANULES", NOT MODULES--------- OR COURSES, AND IS FOCUSED ON APPLICATION - CASE STUDIES AND PRACTICE--------- EXERCISES.-------------- TAKE AETNA'S AMP FACILITATOR AS AN EXAMPLE. "AMP" STANDS FOR THE AETNA--------- MANAGEMENT PROCESS, THE WAY WE ANALYZE PROBLEMS AND MAKE DECISIONS. IT'S--------- BECOME OUR COMMON LANGUAGE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT WE NOW USE AMP AS A--------- VERB: WE AMP PROJECTS, FOR EXAMPLE. THE 7-STEP PROCESS IS SUPERFICIALLY--------- SIMPLE: DEFINE YOUR MISSION AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS,-SCAN THE INTERNAL--------- AND-EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS, IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE GAPS, SET OBJECTIVES AND--------- ACTION STEPS, IMPLEMENT-AND MONITOR. BUT THE ANALYSIS REQUIRED IS COMPLEX,--------- AS BECOMES APPARENT WHEN-YOU START TO LOOK AT THE MANY SUB-STEPS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIGURE------------ THE AMP FACILITATOR--------------------------------- (20K) - A PERFORMANCE ---------SUPPORT TOOL FOR DECISION-MAKING DESIGNED TO ACCOMODATE SMALL-GROUP AS--------- WELL-AS INDIVIDUAL-USE. NOTE THE GROUP PROCESS ADVICE IN THE----- "GUIDE--------------" POP-UP.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE AMP FACILITATOR IS SOFTWARE WHICH PROVIDES PERFORMANCE SUPPORT TO--------- MANAGERS OR-TEAMS WHO NEED TO APPLY AMP TO A BUSINESS PLAN OR PROJECT.--------- YOU NEED TO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE AMP PROCESS BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE.--------- YOU BRING A PROBLEM, THE AMP FACILITATOR HELPS YOU STRUCTURE THE ANALYTICAL--------- TASKS, COACHES YOU, PROVIDES EXAMPLES AND SELF-CHECKS, AND ALLOWS YOU--------- TO PRINT OUT YOUR RESULTS IN STANDARD PLAN FORMAT. SO WHEN YOU'RE DONE--------- YOU'VE GOT A REAL WORK PRODUCT - YOUR PLAN - AND HAVE LEARNED AN AWFUL--------- LOT ABOUT AMP ALONG THE WAY. I SAID EARLIER THAT LEARNING WAS A DESIRABLE,--------- AND LIKELY OBJECTIVE, BUT SECONDARY TO PERFORMANCE. HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT--------- IN ACTION. I DEFY USERS OF THE AMP FACILITATOR NOT TO LEARN ABOUT AMP--------- WHILE USING IT TO SOLVE THEIR BUSINESS PROBLEMS. BUT WHETHER THEY DO OR--------- NOT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT THE WORK-OUTPUT IS ---------TO A HIGH STANDARD. (FOR MORE ON THE-AMP FACILITATOR, SEE "PERFORMANCE--------- GOES ON-LINE" IN-HUMAN RESOURCE EXECUTIVE, MAY, 1994, PP 24-27.)-------------- PERFORMANCE SUPPORT DOESN'T HAVE TO-BE ELECTRONIC. MUCH CAN-BE ACCOMPLISHED--------- BY PUTTING SOME STRUCTURE BEHIND THE TRADITIONAL NOTION OF ON THE JOB--------- LEARNING. WE CAN PROVIDE GUIDES-TO HELP MANAGERS DEVELOP-THEIR STAFF,----------AND EVALUATE THEIR PROGRESS.-I'M NOT THINKING HERE ABOUT LESSON PLANS.--------- MORE LIKE ADVICE ON HOW TO DETERMINE PERFORMANCE GAPS, WITH RECOMMENDATIONS--------- FOR THE KIND OF ACTIVITIES THAT CAN CLOSE THEM, AND JOB-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES--------- FOR HOW TO COACH AND CRITIQUE STAFF TO COMPETENT PERFORMANCE.-------------- AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE VALUE OF THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES--------- - COMPUTER BASED TUTORIALS AND SIMULATIONS, DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE--------- AND VIDEO TAPE, AND COMBINATIONS OF THESE WITH TEXT-BASED MATERIALS DESIGNED ---------FOR SMALL GROUPS WORKING WITH LOCAL OFFICE OR UNIT FACILITATORS. ALL OFFER--------- CONSISTENT MEANS TO CLOSE THE MOST COMMON OR CRITICAL PERFORMANCE GAPS--------- - AT THE MOMENT OF NEED, ANYWHERE. ALL SHRINK TRAINING-DELIVERY CYCLE-TIMES--------- DRAMATICALLY.-------------- IN TERMS OF CBT, MY EXPERIENCE AT AETNA SUGGESTS THAT EMPHASIS BE PLACED--------- ON SIMULATIONS, WHICH HAVE MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF PROBLEM-CENTERED--------- DESIGNS WITHOUT THE RISKS OF ERRORS WITH REAL CUSTOMERS OR DOLLARS. CONSIDER--------- COMPUTER-BASED SIMULATIONS AS PERFORMANCE SUPPORT TO MANAGERS IN THEIR--------- ROLE AS COACHES. USED IN SMALL GROUP SETTINGS, AS WE DO WITH OUR INTERACTIVE--------- VIDEO JOB SIMULATIONS, EVERY DECISION POINT BECOMES AN OPPORTUNITY TO--------- SHARE PEER AND SUPERVISOR EXPERIENCES. WHAT MIGHT BE A ONE HOUR CASE STUDY--------- WHEN USED INDIVIDUALLY, BECOMES A RICH FOUR HOURS OF DISCUSSION AND SHARED--------- "WAR STORIES" IN A SMALL GROUP IMPLEMENTATION.-------------- AS FOR DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE, THE TRICK THERE IS TO MAKE IT TRULY--------- INTERACTIVE-AND PROBLEM-BASED WITH A MASS-AUDIENCE. FROM THE TECHNOLOGY--------- SIDE WE ATTACK-THAT BY ADDING RESPONSE KEYPADS FOR-EVERY PARTICIPANT.--------- AND IN OUR BEST DESIGNS, LIKE MANAGED CARE COLLEGE, NO "TEACHING" AT ALL--------- IS DONE ON THE AIR - THE FOCUS IS ON TEAMS LEARNING TOGETHER LOCALLY AND--------- COMPETING WITH OTHER TEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY VIA DBS. THE "PROBLEM" THEY'RE--------- ALL SOLVING IS HOW TO SELL - MORE SPECIFICALLY, HOW TO RESPOND TO REALISTIC--------- CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIONS WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE GENERATED.--------- THE RESULT HAS BEEN SALES REPS TELLING MANAGEMENT THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE--------- SOLD SUCH-AND-SUCH A CASE IF THEY HADN'T HAD THIS REALISTIC EXPERIENCE.--------- AND EVERY MANAGED CARE SALE IS A BIG DEAL IN OUR BUSINESS.-------------- IF DESIGNING PROBLEM-CENTERED, 100 PERCENT LEARNING EVENTS AND PERFORMANCE--------- SUPPORT ARE ALL IT TAKES, WHY ISN'T-EVERYONE DOING IT? REMEMBER WHAT I--------- SAID ABOUT REENGINEERING? IT WORKS, BUT-IT ISN'T EASY.-------------- THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS; SOME OF THEM--------- UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO HOME. IF YOUR STAFF DEFINE THEMSELVES AS TRAINERS--------- FIRST, AND DESIGNERS SECOND, YOU'RE LIKELY TO RUN INTO TROUBLE. FREQUENTLY--------- IN CORPORATE TRAINING UNITS, THE CAREER PATH IS FROM INSTRUCTION DELIVERER--------- TO INSTRUCTION DEVELOPER. IS IT ANY WONDER THAT WE TEND TO DESIGN TRADITIONAL ---------EVENTS - TRAINER RATHER THAN LEARNER DRIVEN?-------------- PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO TURN THE CAREER PATH AROUND TO MATCH THE PROBLEM-CENTERED--------- APPROACH TO LEARNING. IN OTHER WORDS, CONSIDER HIRING (OR ROTATING) TRAINERS--------- FROM BUSINESS UNITS. LET THEIR FIRST ASSIGNMENTS BE IN PROBLEM-CENTERED--------- EVENT DEVELOPMENT, SUPPORTED BY PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGNERS,--------- AND MAKING FULL USE OF-THEIR RECENT BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. THEN ONLY SECONDARILY,--------- AND ONLY SOMETIMES, SHOULD THEY EVER SET FOOT INSIDE A-CLASSROOM. AFTER--------- ALL, IF YOU'RE DESIGNING 100 PERCENT EVENTS, YOU'VE GOT TO PLACE MUCH--------- MORE EMPHASIS ON DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT RELATIVE TO THE 20 PERCENT OR--------- LESS OF TRADITIONAL DELIVERY THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE.-------------- SINCE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DELIVERING--------- THE 80 PLUS PERCENT OF ON THE JOB LEARNING, SPECIAL ATTENTION MUST BE--------- PLACED ON ASSURING-THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE TO SUPPORT THEM. CONSISTENT--------- HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, WELL MAINTAINED, AND AVAILABLE AT OR VERY NEAR--------- THE WORK SITE ARE ESSENTIAL.-------------- OUR VOCABULARY IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL BARRIER. THE WORDS WE USE - COURSE,--------- EVENT, PROGRAM; TRAINER, INSTRUCTOR, TEACHER - ALL SUGGEST TRADITIONAL--------- DEFINITIONS OF HOW AND WHERE TRAINING (NOT LEARNING) TAKES PLACE. WHAT--------- DOES REGISTRATION MEAN IF OUR LEARNING PRODUCT IS AN ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE--------- SUPPORT SYSTEM INTENDED TO BE USED AS NEEDED ANYTIME? AND HOW DO WE COST--------- OUR SERVICES IF WE BLUR THE NOTION OF A TRAINING EVENT? HOW DO WE RESIST--------- THE PRESSURE - INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY APPLIED - TO "COUNT BEANS": STUDENT--------- NUMBERS OR STUDENT DAYS?-------------- OFTEN TOO, WE BEHAVE ILLOGICALLY IN THE MATTER OF TRAINING CYCLE TIMES.--------- WE MEASURE THE TIME FROM AN INITIAL REQUEST THROUGH DELIVERY OF THE FIRST--------- POST-PILOT VERSION OF THE EVENT. NEVER MIND THAT IT MAY TAKE AN ADDITIONAL--------- ONE TO THREE YEARS TO MARCH EVERYONE THROUGH. HOW CAN WE CONTINUE TO DO--------- THIS. I MEAN, IF THE PERFORMANCE GAP IS SO URGENT, SHOULDN'T WE BE TARGETING--------- CLOSURE IN MONTHS, NOT YEARS? WITH OR WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY FOR DELIVERY,--------- WE CAN AND SHOULD SET CYCLE-TIME GOALS ON THE ORDER OF SIX MONTHS OR LESS--------- - FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE PROJECT UNTIL ALL HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND THE--------- PERFORMANCE GAP IS CLOSED.-------------- GETTING MANAGERS TO ACCEPT THEIR ROLE AS COACHES AND EVALUATORS IS NO--------- EASY TASK EITHER. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ALLIES IN HIGH PLACES - SENIOR--------- MANAGEMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS. REWARDS SYSTEMS HAVE TO--------- DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE YOU PLACE ON THE MANAGER AS COACH. ALL YOUR INVESTMENT--------- IN DESIGNING THE 80% THAT OCCURS ON THE JOB IS WASTED OTHERWISE.-------------- AND SPEAKING OF ALLIES, DON'T EXPECT TO CREATE LARGE SCALE ELECTRONIC--------- PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS ON YOUR OWN - YOU'D FIND YOURSELF IN COMPETITION--------- WITH TRADITIONAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS, A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE--------- AND UNNECESSARY PLACE-TO BE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, DESIGN OF ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE--------- SUPPORT SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE A COLLABORATION OF SYSTEMS PROFESSIONALS,--------- INTERFACE DESIGNERS, DOCUMENTATION SPECIALISTS, BUSINESS EXPERTS, AND--------- LEARNING TECHNOLOGISTS. THE DESIGN TEAM NEEDS TO BE AS INTEGRATED AS THE--------- SYSTEM YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE.-------------- YES, THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS, BUT NONE ARE INSURMOUNTABLE.--------- IS IT ALL WORTH IT? YOU BET IT IS. WHEN IT WORKS, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.--------- IF YOU'RE STILL NOT CONVINCED, TRY THESE WORDS FROM AETNA'S CHAIRMAN,--------- RON COMPTON, DELIVERED IN HIS KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE FIRST ELECTRONIC--------- PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEM CONFERENCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO:-------------- "WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT LEARNING AS AN OUTCOME, WHEN LEARNING IS ONLY--------- A BYPRODUCT. PERFORMANCE IS WHAT WE WANT. AND BY PROVIDING THE SUPPORTS--------- EMPLOYEES NEED TO LEARN THEIR JOBS WHILE THEY DO THEIR JOBS, WE'LL GET--------- COMPETENT PERFORMANCE FASTER AND MORE CONSISTENTLY.-------------- "AS BUSINESS MANAGERS FACING A TOUGH AND UNKNOWABLE FUTURE, WE CAN'T--------- AFFORD THE LUXURY OF LEARNING, WHEN IT'S NOT ACCOMPANIED BY PERFORMING.--------- WE HAVE TO RADICALLY CHANGE OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR PROCESSES SO THAT--------- AUTOMATION FINALLY GIVES US THE GAINS IN PRODUCTIVITY THAT UP TO NOW HAVE--------- BEEN UNKEPT PROMISES. TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE AS MANAGERS MUST SHOW LEADERSHIP--------- OF THE MOST RADICAL KIND, WILLING TO DEVELOP AND USE THE TOOLS THAT MAKE--------- US BETTER WORKERS, BETTER LISTENERS AND BETTER THINKERS. AND WE MUST BE--------- WILLING TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT, BOTH HUMAN AND ELECTRONIC, THAT OUR WORKERS--------- NEED TO PERFORM SUCCESSFULLY.-----------------" ABOUT THE AUTHOR:---- STAN MALCOLM SERVES AS A COACH TO COMPANIES--------- WISHING TO DEVELOP OR REVIEW THEIR STRATEGIES FOR PERFORMANCE SUPPORT,--------- LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, AND/OR CORPORATE LEARNING ISSUES GENERALLY.
