□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□1.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Radiometry basics□□□□□□□□□□□The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link to
W□□□□□S□ref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements can be made
either□in terms of radiometric units, which correspond to raw energy or
power,□or photometric units, which are corrected for visibility. When
dealing□with safety issues, we are primarily concerned with radiometric
measures;□the same principles apply to photometric measurements,
however, so when□we use a radiometric term, the corresponding
photometric term will be listed□in parentheses.
□□□□The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance
(illuminance)□and radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes the total
power falling□on a surface (such as the surface of a detector, or a
tissue surface in□the eye). The units of irradiance are expressed in
power per unit area,□typically Watts per centimeter squared (W/cm□□□□□□).
□□□□When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power, the
energy□comes from a source. Most sources are distributed in space, that
is, they□have some finite size. (This size approaches zero for a
perfectly collimated□beam, such as might be emitted by a laser.) The
radiance of a source is□simply the irradiance it produces, divided by
the size of the source, where□the size is expressed as the solid angle
(in steradians) subtended by the□source from the point at which the
measurement is made. A little reflection□should make it clear that the
radiance of a source is independent of the□distance at which the
measurement is made: if we double the distance from□the source, the
irradiance will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse square□law); but the
apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factor□of 4, and
the two factors cancel out.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□2.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Types of ocular exposure□□□□□□□□□□□□For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas of
concern:□the first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation
(particularly infrared)□strikes the cornea, it can heat and dry it,
causing damage to the tissue.□(Infrared radiation can also cause damage
to soft contact lenses at levels□that are considered safe for eye
exposure, but to my knowledge there is□no published data on this!)
□□□□The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to the
retina□can cause areas of local blindness ("scotomas"). The calculation
of retinal□irradiance is fairly straightforward: the total amount of
power entering□the eye can be calculated as the product of the corneal
irradiance times□the □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□effective pupil area□□□□. The illuminated area
of□retina will be an image of the source, subtending the same angle
from the□posterior nodal point as the source does from the anterior
nodal point.□Therefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the
solid angle subtended□by the source (in steradians) and the posterior
nodal distance of the eye.
□□□□To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide by
the□source solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source is the
exit□pupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure. It can be shown
by a□little algebra that this is identically equal to the original
source radiance!
□□□□For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This
assumption□may be violated for real sources; for example, a lamp
filament will have□"hot spots" where the local radiance is higher than
the average radiance.□In these situations, it is best to use a diffuser
to homogenize the source□image. Diffractive optical elements capable of
diffusing a beam within□a narrow angular range (such as those
manufactured by Physical Optics Corporation)□are ideal for this
application.

simply□enter the diameter in millimeters of the active surface. For a
non-circular□detector, calculate the area (in mm□□□□□), then divide by pi
(3.14159), take□the square root of the result and multiply by 2 to
obtain the equivalent□diameter.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Wavelength□□□□□□□□□A monochromatic or narrow band source is assumed. For a broadband
infrared□source, the value here is not too critical, because the
calculations are□not too wavelength dependent. To be conservative, use
a value of xxx nm.□Broadband visible sources are more problematic,
because the "blue light□hazard" function has a sharp peak at 4xx nm.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Source dimensions at pupil□□□□□□□□□These parameters are most relevant for setups (such as Maxwellian
view□optical systems) where the source is imaged in the pupil by a
system of□one or more lenses. In the case where the source image is
smaller than□the natural pupil (assumed to be 7 mm), the source area is
used for the□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□effective pupil area□□□□. For cases where the entire□eye/face
is illuminated directly by a source, the values here do not
really□matter, as long as they are larger than 7mm.

appears uniformly□filled with light, use the diameter and distance of
the lens.
