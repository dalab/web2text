------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPTICAL RADIATION SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS-----------------------  THIS DOCUMENT OUTLINES THE BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE PROPER USE-OF THE OPTICAL RADIATION SAFETY CALCULATOR. IT IS DESIGNED FOR ASSESSING-SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE EYE IS ILLUMINATED, EITHER TO PROVIDE A STIMULUS-OR TO ILLUMINATE IT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY, VIDEOGRAPHY OR DIRECT OBSERVATION.-THE OPTICAL RADIATION SAFETY CALCULATOR PERFORMS CALCULATIONS FOR RADIATION-AT VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS (400-700 NM), AND NEAR INFRARED (700-1400 NM).---------------------------  RADIOMETRY BASICS----------------------------  TYPES OF OCULAR EXPOSURE-----------------------------  USING THE PROGRAM------------------------------  GLOSSARY----------  REFERENCES--------------------------------------------------  RADIOMETRY BASICS---------  THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RADIOMETRY CAN BE FOUND ELSEWHERE (LINK TO W----&S-REF), BUT WILL BE PRESENTED HERE IN BRIEF. MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE EITHER-IN TERMS OF RADIOMETRIC UNITS, WHICH CORRESPOND TO RAW ENERGY OR POWER,-OR PHOTOMETRIC UNITS, WHICH ARE CORRECTED FOR VISIBILITY. WHEN DEALING-WITH SAFETY ISSUES, WE ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH RADIOMETRIC MEASURES;-THE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY TO PHOTOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS,-HOWEVER, SO WHEN-WE USE A RADIOMETRIC TERM,-THE CORRESPONDING PHOTOMETRIC TERM WILL BE LISTED-IN PARENTHESES.---  THE BASIC-RADIOMETRIC (PHOTOMETRIC) MEASUREMENTS ARE IRRADIANCE (ILLUMINANCE)-AND RADIANCE (LUMINANCE). IRRADIANCE DESCRIBES THE TOTAL POWER FALLING-ON A SURFACE (SUCH AS THE SURFACE OF A DETECTOR,-OR A TISSUE SURFACE IN-THE EYE). THE UNITS OF IRRADIANCE ARE EXPRESSED IN POWER PER UNIT AREA,-TYPICALLY WATTS PER CENTIMETER SQUARED (W/CM---XX-).---  WHEN A SURFACE IS IRRADIATED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POWER, THE ENERGY-COMES FROM A SOURCE. MOST SOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED IN SPACE, THAT IS, THEY-HAVE SOME FINITE SIZE. (THIS SIZE APPROACHES ZERO FOR A PERFECTLY COLLIMATED-BEAM, SUCH AS MIGHT BE EMITTED BY A LASER.) THE RADIANCE OF A SOURCE IS-SIMPLY THE IRRADIANCE IT PRODUCES, DIVIDED BY THE SIZE OF THE SOURCE, WHERE-THE SIZE IS EXPRESSED AS THE SOLID ANGLE (IN STERADIANS) SUBTENDED BY THE-SOURCE FROM THE-POINT AT WHICH THE MEASUREMENT IS MADE.-A LITTLE REFLECTION-SHOULD-MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE RADIANCE OF A SOURCE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE-DISTANCE AT WHICH THE-MEASUREMENT IS MADE: IF WE DOUBLE THE DISTANCE FROM-THE SOURCE, THE IRRADIANCE WILL DECREASE BY A FACTOR OF 4 (INVERSE SQUARE-LAW); BUT THE-APPARENT SIZE OF THE SOURCE WILL ALSO DECREASE BY A FACTOR-OF 4, AND THE TWO FACTORS CANCEL OUT.----------------------------------------------  TYPES OF OCULAR EXPOSURE----------  FOR CONSIDERATIONS OF EYE SAFETY, THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPLE AREAS OF CONCERN:-THE FIRST IS CORNEAL IRRADIANCE. WHEN OPTICAL RADIATION (PARTICULARLY INFRARED)-STRIKES THE CORNEA, IT CAN HEAT AND DRY IT, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TISSUE.-(INFRARED RADIATION CAN ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO-SOFT CONTACT LENSES AT LEVELS-THAT ARE CONSIDERED SAFE-FOR EYE EXPOSURE, BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS-NO PUBLISHED DATA ON THIS!)---  THE SECOND AREA OF CONCERN IS RETINAL IRRADIATION. DAMAGE TO THE RETINA-CAN CAUSE AREAS OF LOCAL BLINDNESS ("SCOTOMAS"). THE CALCULATION OF RETINAL-IRRADIANCE IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD: THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF POWER ENTERING-THE EYE CAN BE CALCULATED AS THE PRODUCT OF THE CORNEAL-IRRADIANCE TIMES-THE------------------- EFFECTIVE PUPIL AREA----. THE ILLUMINATED AREA OF-RETINA WILL BE AN IMAGE OF THE SOURCE, SUBTENDING THE SAME ANGLE FROM THE-POSTERIOR NODAL POINT AS THE SOURCE DOES FROM THE ANTERIOR NODAL POINT.-THEREFORE,-THE RETINAL AREA IS SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF THE SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED-BY THE SOURCE (IN STERADIANS)-AND THE POSTERIOR NODAL DISTANCE OF THE EYE.---  TO CONVERT RETINAL IRRADIANCE TO RADIANCE, WE NEED TO DIVIDE BY THE-SOURCE SOLID ANGLE; BUT AT THE RETINA, THE APPARENT SOURCE IS THE EXIT-PUPIL OF THE EYE, SO THIS IS THE RELEVANT MEASURE. IT CAN BE SHOWN BY A-LITTLE ALGEBRA THAT THIS IS IDENTICALLY EQUAL TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE RADIANCE---!  FOR THE CALCULATIONS WE ASSUME THAT THE-SOURCE IS UNIFORM. THIS-ASSUMPTION-MAY-BE VIOLATED FOR REAL SOURCES; FOR-EXAMPLE, A-LAMP FILAMENT WILL HAVE-"HOT SPOTS--WHERE THE LOCAL RADIANCE IS HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE RADIANCE.-IN THESE SITUATIONS, IT IS BEST TO USE A DIFFUSER TO HOMOGENIZE THE SOURCE-IMAGE. DIFFRACTIVE OPTICAL ELEMENTS CAPABLE OF DIFFUSING A BEAM WITHIN-A NARROW ANGULAR RANGE (SUCH AS THOSE MANUFACTURED BY PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION)-ARE IDEAL FOR THIS APPLICATION.-----------------------------------------------  USING-THE PROGRAM-----------------------------------------  DETECTOR DIAMETER.-------  A CIRCULAR DETECTOR AREA IS ASSUMED. FOR A CIRCULAR DETECTOR, SIMPLY-ENTER THE DIAMETER IN MILLIMETERS OF THE ACTIVE SURFACE. FOR A NON-CIRCULAR-DETECTOR, CALCULATE THE AREA (IN MM---XX), THEN DIVIDE BY PI (3.14159), TAKE-THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE RESULT AND MULTIPLY BY 2 TO OBTAIN THE EQUIVALENT-DIAMETER.-------------------------------------  WAVELENGTH-------  A MONOCHROMATIC OR NARROW BAND SOURCE IS ASSUMED. FOR A BROADBAND INFRARED-SOURCE, THE VALUE HERE IS NOT TOO CRITICAL, BECAUSE THE CALCULATIONS ARE-NOT TOO WAVELENGTH DEPENDENT. TO BE CONSERVATIVE, USE A VALUE OF XXX NM.-BROADBAND VISIBLE SOURCES ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC, BECAUSE THE "BLUE LIGHT-HAZARD" FUNCTION HAS A SHARP PEAK AT 4XX NM.--------------------------------  SOURCE DIMENSIONS AT PUPIL-------  THESE PARAMETERS ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR SETUPS (SUCH AS MAXWELLIAN VIEW-OPTICAL SYSTEMS) WHERE THE SOURCE IS IMAGED IN THE PUPIL BY A SYSTEM OF-ONE OR MORE LENSES. IN THE CASE WHERE THE SOURCE IMAGE IS SMALLER THAN-THE NATURAL PUPIL (ASSUMED TO BE 7 MM), THE SOURCE AREA IS USED FOR THE--------------------EFFECTIVE PUPIL AREA----. FOR CASES WHERE THE ENTIRE-EYE/FACE IS ILLUMINATED DIRECTLY BY A SOURCE, THE VALUES HERE DO NOT REALLY-MATTER, AS LONG AS THEY ARE LARGER THAN -MM.-----------------------------------  APPARENT SIZE AND DISTANCE OF THE SOURCE-------  FOR-FREE VIEWING OF A SOURCE, SIMPLY ENTER THE ACTUAL SIZE-AND DISTANCE-(IN MILLIMETERS). FOR MAXWELLIAN VIEW, WHERE THE FINAL LENS APPEARS UNIFORMLY-FILLED WITH LIGHT, USE THE DIAMETER-AND DISTANCE OF THE LENS.-----------------------------------  DETECTOR POWER-------  ENTER THE POWER MEASUREMENT IN MICROWATTS.-------------------------------------------------  GLOSSARY-----------------------------------  EFFECTIVE PUPIL AREA:---- THE AREA OF THE PUPIL-THROUGH WHICH LIGHT PASSES. UNDER FREE VIEWING CONDITIONS, THIS IS USUALLY-JUST THE AREA OF THE NATURAL PUPIL. IT CAN BE SMALLER THAN THE NATURAL-PUPIL-UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VIEWING THROUGH A SMALL ARTIFICIAL-PUPIL, OR WHEN USING AN INSTRUMENT WITH A SMALL EXIT PUPIL SUCH AS A-MAXWELLIAN-VIEW OPTICAL SYSTEM.--------------------------  REFERENCES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
