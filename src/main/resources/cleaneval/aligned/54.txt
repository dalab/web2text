SALVATION-CAME FROM AN UNEXPECTED PLACE: THE HORROR FILM. FEBRUARY SAW THE BLOCKBUSTER-RELEASE OF--- DRACULA----, AND ONLY EIGHT MONTHS LATER--- FRANKENSTEIN-----WAS RELEASED TO BECOME AN EVEN BIGGER HIT. INEVITABLY THIS SUCCESS-LED THE STUDIO TO PURSUE A SEQUEL, AND IN 1935 UNIVERSAL RELEASED----THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN----, RETURNING THE DIRECTOR (JAMES-WHALE) AND MOST OF THE ORIGINAL CAST. THE FILM WAS A SPECTACULAR SUCCESS-AT THE BOX OFFICE. WHAT THE AVERAGE 1935 MOVIE-GOER SAW IN THE THEATER,-THOUGH, WAS A FILM HEAVILY TWEAKED FROM THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT WHALE-HAD BEEN PURSUING. UNLIKE ITS PREDECESSOR,--- THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN-----WAS EXPOSED TO THE HEAVY HAND OF JOE BREEN AND THE PRODUCTION CODE-ADMINISTRATION; A REVIEW OF THE SHOOTING SCRIPT AND NOTES BREEN WROTE-TO THE PRODUCERS REVEAL FORCED ALTERATIONS-THAT CHANGE THE NATURE-OF THE FILM AND ITS CHARACTERS.--------- WHEN THE ORIGINAL--- FRANKENSTEIN---- WAS-RELEASED IN 1931 THE-PRODUCTION-CODE HAD NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO ENFORCEMENT. CENSORSHIP WAS YET THE-DOMINION OF VARIOUS LOCAL AND STATE FILM BOARDS. THOUGH-THESE GROUPS-CUT VARIOUS SCENES FROM THE SCREENED PRINTS OF THE ORIGINAL, THERE-WAS NO FEDERAL CENSORSHIP TO DEAL WITH UNTIL THE FILM'S RE-RELEASE-IN 1937 (MANGUEL 14).--- BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN----, HOWEVER, HAD-TO DEAL WITH THE PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE BEGINNING.-MANY CASES OF CENSORSHIP CENTERED AROUND THE DEPICTION OF THE FEMALE-FORM AND SEXUALITY, BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE ISSUES RAISED IN--- BRIDE-OF FRANKENSTEIN---- WERE ONES OF VIOLENCE AND RELIGION.---------- BREEN, AS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC, WAS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO UNFAVORABLE-PORTRAYALS OF RELIGION IN THE MOVIES. IN THIS FILM BREEN WAS ESPECIALLY-WORRIED BY ANY SCENES THAT WOULD COMPARE FRANKENSTEIN TO GOD. VERY-EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS HE CAUTIONED THE STUDIO AGAINST PURSUING THIS-OBVIOUS ANALOGY. ``THROUGHOUT THE SCRIPT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF-REFERENCES TO FRANKENSTEIN ... WHICH COMPARE HIM TO GOD AND WHICH-COMPARE HIS CREATION OF THE MONSTER TO GOD'S CREATION OF MAN.'' HERE-BREEN WAS BLUNT: ``ALL SUCH REFERENCES SHOULD BE DELETED'' (GARDNER-66). THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS-TOO TIED TO THE COMPARISON FOR SUCH AN-ULTIMATUM TO BE COMPLETELY FOLLOWED, HOWEVER, AND A BACK-AND-FORTH-ON THE TOPIC WENT ON-THROUGHOUT THE-PRODUCTION PROCESS. IN ONE SCENE-OF THE SHOOTING SCRIPT FRANKENSTEIN INTENSELY MONOLOGUES: ``I COULD-HAVE BRED A RACE AND HAVE FOUND PERHAPS THE SECRET OF ETERNAL LIFE.-ALL THAT WAS IN MY BRAIN -- MY-VERY GRASP. I CONCEIVED IT -- IT WAS-LIKE-BEING GOD!'' (RILEY B-7) PREDICTABLY, JOE BREEN WAS NOT-AMUSED.-HE SUGGESTED OMITTING THE-LINE, SAYING THAT IT-HAD IN THE PAST ``PROVEN-SOMEWHAT BLASPHEMOUS'' (GARDNER 67). WHALER RESPONDED BY OFFERING-TO REFER TO ``BEING THE CREATOR'' INSTEAD,-BUT IN THE END THE-OFFERED PROVED MOOT AS THE ENTIRE LINE WAS CUT FROM THE THEATRICAL-PRINT. LATER IN THE SEQUENCE DR. PRETORIUS WAS TO DERISIVELY TELL-FRANKENSTEIN TO ``FOLLOW THE LEAD OF NATURE ... OR OF GOD -- IF-YOU ARE FOND OF YOUR FAIRY TALES'' (RILEY B--6). BREEN WANTED THE-LINE CUT; WHALER INSTEAD CHANGED--`FAIRY TALES'' TO ``BIBLE-STORIES.''--------- ANOTHER RELIGIOUSLY ORIENTED CUT PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE WAY-IN WHICH CODE-REQUIRED CUTS COULD ALTER THE ATTITUDE OF A SCENE. WHILE-RUNNING FROM A PURSUING MOB FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER HAPPENS INTO A-CEMETERY. THE SCRIPT CALLED FOR THE MONSTER TO HAPPEN UPON AN ``IMPOSING-MONUMENT'' DEPICTING CHRIST ON THE CROSS (F-8). THE MONSTER, IN A-SHOW OF COMPASSION, TRIES TO HELP THE STRICKEN FIGURE, THINKING IT-TO BE A HUMAN MISTREATED AS HE HAS BEEN. THE MONSTER'S EFFORT ENDS-UP TOPPLING THE MONUMENT, REVEALING THE CRYPT ENTRANCE BELOW. BREEN-OBJECTED-TO THE SCENE, SAYING-THAT WHALER ``SHOULD OMIT THE FIGURE-OF THE STATUE OF THE CHRIST FROM THIS SCENE, SUBSTITUTING SOME OTHER-TYPE OF MONUMENT'' (GARDNER 67). CHANGING THE MONUMENT, HOWEVER,-CHANGES HOW THE AUDIENCE VIEWS THE MONSTER'S ACTIONS. INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING-TO BE-COMPASSIONATE, THE MONSTER IS INSTEAD SHOWN LASHING OUT AT A-RANDOM STATUE, TOPPLING IT IN AN ACT THAT IS FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN-THE ORIGINAL WAS-TO BE. THOUGH BREEN MEANT ONLY TO PREVENT A CONSERVATIVE-PUBLIC FROM FINDING OFFENSE IN THE SCENE, THE EFFECT OF HIS ACTION-WAS TO FORCE UPON THE MONSTER AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOTIVATION.--------- ASIDE FROM DEPICTIONS OF RELIGION, BREEN-WAS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH-THE-GRUESOMENESS AND VIOLENCE THE FILM PROMISED. EVEN AFTER PRIMARY-SHOOTING HAD ENDED BREEN-WROTE TO UNIVERSAL WARNING THEM THAT THE-FILM WOULD NOT GET ITS SEAL AS IT THEN STOOD. ``THIS PICTURE SEEMS-TO US DEFINITELY TO BE A VIOLATION OF OUR PRODUCTION CODE,'' HE WROTE-THEM, ``BECAUSE OF ITS EXCESSIVE BRUTALITY AND GRUESOMENESS''-(69). SCENES ALREADY FILMED WERE TARGETED FOR REMOVAL. EARLY IN THE-FILM A MAN AND HIS WIFE ARE LEFT STANDING BY THE BURNING WRECKAGE-OF THE MILL AS THE CROWD THAT WATCHED THE MONSTER DESTROYED WANDERS-OFF. THE MAN MOVES CLOSER, WANTING HIS EYES TO CONFIRM-FOR HIM THAT-THE MONSTER WAS TRULY DEAD. INSTEAD THE MAN FALLS INTO THE WATER BELOW-AND COMES FACE-TO-FACE WITH A MONSTER VERY MUCH ALIVE. THE MAN IS-KILLED, AND AS THE MONSTER CRAWLS UP TO THE SURFACE THE WIFE IS BROUGHT-TO A SIMILAR FATE. THE SCRIPT GAVE A SCENE IN WHICH THE DRAMA BETWEEN-MONSTER AND MAN UNFOLDED SLOWLY; BREEN WANTED THE MAN'S DROWNING TO-GO UNSHOWN. HE ALSO WANTED DELETED THE SHOT OF THE MONSTER PULLING-THE WIFE INTO THE WATER. HE WON ONE AND LOST ONE, AS UNIVERSAL CUT-THE DROWNING SCENE BUT KEPT THE IMAGE OF THE WIFE BEING TOSSED TO-HER DEATH. LATER THERE IS A SCENE WHERE THE MONSTER KILLS A SMALL-GIRL. THIS BODY IS VIEWED-BY A GROUP OF ``LITTLE GIRLS COMING OUT-OF CHURCH IN THEIR WHITE DRESSES'' AND LATER CARRIED THROUGH THE-STREETS BY THE MOTHER. THE FINAL PRINT OF THE FILM STILL CONTAINED-THE SHOT OF THE GIRLS VIEWING THE OFF-CAMERA BODY, BUT CUT THE ONE-THAT WOULD HAVE SHOWN THE BODY ITSELF (--).--------- BREEN WAS CONCERNED NOT JUST WITH VISUALS THAT MIGHT UPSET THE PUBLIC,-BUT DIALOGUE CHOICES AS WELL. THE OPENING SHOTS OF THE FILM ORIGINALLY-INCLUDED A SCENE WHERE MARY SHELLEY SAYS THAT SHE, HER POET HUSBAND,-AND LORD BYRON ARE ``ALL THREE INFIDELS, SCOFFERS AT ALL MARRIAGE-TIES, BELIEVING ONLY IN LIVING FULLY AND FREELY IN WHATEVER DIRECTION-THE HEART DICTATES'' (RILEY A-5). THE LINE, ALONG WITH MOST OF THOSE-MEANT FOR THESE THREE, WAS CUT COMPLETELY FROM THE THEATRICAL PRINT.-ELSEWHERE BREEN GOT DETAILED ENOUGH TO BE SQUIRMISH ABOUT THE WORD-``ENTRAILS,'' GETTING IT REPLACED WITH ``INSIDES.'' (GARDNER-67-68). BREEN ALSO TOOK OBJECTION TO THE IDEA OF THE MONSTER AS A-SEXUAL CREATURE. REVIEWING AN EARLY SCRIPT HE WROTE THAT ``THE-MONSTER'S USE OF THE WORD ``MATE'' SHOULD BE DROPPED IN THIS SCENE.-ALL MATERIAL WHICH SUGGESTS HE DESIRES A SEXUAL COMPANION IS OBJECTIONABLE.-WE SUGGEST YOU SUBSTITUTE THE WORD ``COMPANION'''' (66). IN THE-END THE MONSTER DOES REFER TO HIS SOON-TO-BE-CREATED PARTNER AS A-``WIFE,'' THOUGH WHETHER THIS IMPLIES MORE OR LESS OF A SEXUAL-CONNOTATION THAN MATE IS DEBATABLE (RILEY F-16).--------- ONLY A FEW OF THE SCENES CENSORED IN--- BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN-----INVOLVED SEXUALITY. IN THE SCENE WHERE DR. PRETORIUS SHOWS FRANKENSTEIN-HIS CREATED MINIATURE CREATURES, ONE OF THE JARS CONTAINS A TINY MERMAID.-BREEN WROTE THAT, ``THE SCENE OF THE MINIATURE MERMAID SHOULD BE-HANDLED IN SUCH A WAY AS-TO AVOID ANY IMPROPER EXPOSURE'' (GARDNER-67). THE SHOOTING SCRIPT MADE GAVE NO GUIDANCE ON WHAT THE MERMAID-SHOULD LOOK LIKE, BUT THE FINAL RELEASE MADE SURE THE MERMAID WAS-WELL-CLOTHED. CUT ENTIRELY FROM THE FILM WERE SCENES IN WHICH MARY-SHELLEY WAS CONSIDERED TO BE SHOWING TOO MUCH OF HER BREASTS. BREEN'S-MEMO AFTER PHOTOGRAPHY HAD FINISHED TERSELY DEMANDED THAT THE STUDIO-``DELETE ALL THE ``BREAST SHOTS'' IN REEL 1'' (69). THESE-SHOTS WENT, AND THEIR LATE REMOVAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REASON-SO MUCH OF THE DIALOGUE FROM THESE SCENES WAS GUTTED.--------- THE ENDING OF THE FILM WAS ALSO CHANGED AFTER PRIMARY SHOOTING HAD-ENDED, THOUGH IN THIS CASE CHANGES WERE DUE MORE TO UNIVERSAL'S CONCERN-THAT THE FILM HAVE A HAPPY ENDING THAN TO ANY CENSORSHIP CONCERNS.-WHERE THE SHOOTING SCRIPT HAS FRANKENSTEIN AND ELIZABETH DYING ALONGSIDE-THE DOCTOR AND THEIR ALMOST-HUMAN CREATIONS, THE FINAL THEATRICAL-PRINT DOES NOT. THE PRINCIPALS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO RESHOOT AN ENDING-IN WHICH THE MONSTER ALLOWS FRANKENSTEIN AND ELIZABETH TO LEAVE THE-TOWER BEFORE ITS DESTRUCTION. HOWEVER REFILMING THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE-WAS TOO COSTLY AND IN THE FINAL SHOT BEFORE THE TOWER IS DESTROYED-FRANKENSTEIN IS SEEN STILL INSIDE, EVEN THOUGH JUST PREVIOUSLY HE-HAD BEEN SHOWN TO LEAVE.--------- IN THE END BREEN GAVE--- BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN---- A SEAL DESPITE-THE FACT THAT IT HAD NOT ADDRESSED ALL THE OBJECTIONS HE HAD RAISED.-JUST BECAUSE THE PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION SIGNED OFF ON THE-FILM DID NOT MEAN THE REST OF THE WAY WAS SMOOTH SAILING, THOUGH.-BREEN WARNED UNIVERSAL TO EXPECT TROUBLE WITH OTHER CENSORING AGENCIES:------------- IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT THIS PICTURE WILL MEET WITH CONSIDERABLY-DIFFICULTY AT THE HANDS OF [STATE AND LOCAL] CENSOR BOARDS BOTH-IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD. THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTION IS SUCH AS-TO INVITE VERY CRITICAL EXAMINATION ON THE PART OF THESE CENSOR BOARDS,-AND YOU MAY WELL EXPECT DIFFICULTY WITH IT WHEREVER THE PICTURE IS-SHOWN (71).-------------- BREEN'S WARNING PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. A FEW STATES DID-MAKE CUTS TO THE FILM, BUT PRIMARILY TROUBLE CAME WHEN THE PRODUCTION-WAS SHOWN ABROAD. THE FILM WAS GUTTED IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND BANNED-OUTRIGHT IN A FEW OTHERS.---------- DESPITE ITS CENSORSHIP TROUBLES, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN WAS AN ENORMOUS-FISCAL SUCCESS. AUDIENCES WERE ABLE TO LOOK PAST THE PLOT HOLES INTRODUCED-BY THE MANY MINUTES OF FOOTAGE CUT AFTER FILMING AND FIND A COMPELLING-HORROR FILM. TODAY MANY OF BREEN'S CUTS LOOK PETTY AND THE REMAINING-CONTENT ENTIRELY TAME, BUT TO THE AUDIENCE OF THE TIME THIS WAS AN-AMAZING FILM. THE PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION GREATLY AFFECTED-THE CINEMA OF ITS TIME, AND IN--- BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN---- YOU-CAN SEE HOW THE REQUIRED CHANGES ALTERED THE TONE AND CHARACTER OF-THE FILM.--------------------------------------------- WORKS CITED--------------------- GARDNER, GERALD.
