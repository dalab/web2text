LANGUAGE-----POLICY FOR WALES--------------------------------------------------BY ROGER WARREN EVANS, FABIAN, GOWER CLP----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "THE LANGUAGE ISSUE-----" HAS LONG-FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN THE POLITICS- OF WALES.------ THE ISSUE IS--CONVENTIONALLY CONCEIVED IN TERMS OF THE ASSERTION OF WELSH USAGE ---------AGAINST----------" ENGLISH USAGE.----- USE OF THE WELSH LANGUAGE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF- WELSH NATIONALISM, OF THE ASSERTION OF A WELSH, CELTIC CULTURAL IDENTITY TO- CONTRAST WITH THE CONVENTIONS OF AN ANGLO-SAXON----- "ENGLISH-----" CULTURE.----- IT IS TRUE THAT THE HISTORY OF WALES HAS BEEN SCARRED BY THE OPPRESSION OF THE WELSH LANGUAGE, AND- OF WELSH SPEAKERS, BY DOMINANT ENGLISH SPEAKERS.------ SIMILAR LINGUISTIC POLARITIES- HAVE SCARRED OTHER EUROPEAN SOCIETIES, IN BELGIUM, BRITTANY, AND THE BASQUE- PROVINCES. AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND,- IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE- THAT THOSE OPPOSING--- RULE FROM LONDON---- SHOULD HAVE RALLIED AROUND THE- TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE OF WALES.----- IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT ONE OF THE MOST- RADICAL WELSH POLITICAL GROUPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED--- CYMDEITHAS YR IAITH----,- OR--- THE WELSH-LANGUAGE SOCIETY----.--------------------------  A FUTURE LANGUAGE POLICY FOR WALES------------ SHOULD, HOWEVER, BE CONCEIVED IN MUCH BROADER TERMS: IT SHOULD NOT BE- CONSTRAINED BY-THE NARROW CONFLICTS OF WELSH AND ENGLISH SPEAKERS.------ INDEED,-THERE IS A--PARALLEL NEED FOR A UK-WIDE LANGUAGE POLICY TO GOVERN THE USE-OF-MULTIPLE LANGUAGES BY THE- MODERN STATE AND ITS- AGENCIES.------ AS A MODERN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY, THE NEED IS TO ADAPT TO THE- REQUIREMENTS OF--- MULTILINGUALISM----, AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE CONVENTIONS OF A- MONOGLOT, OR EVEN BI-LINGUAL, SOCIETY. IN A MODERN SOCIETY LIKE WALES, THE NEED- IS FOR A NEW SYSTEMATIC TREATMENT OF THE OVERALL---- PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION BY LANGUAGE----.-  LANGUAGE POLICY HAS TWO QUITE- DISTINCT DIMENSIONS, NAMELY THE PERSONAL AND THE COMMUNAL.----------------------------------  I------------ PERSONAL--------------------------------------  THE FIRST PRINCIPLE-----------, ALREADY FORMULATED AT- UK LAW FOR THE PURPOSES OF CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDINGS, IS THAT ANY PERSON, WHEN- FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF CONDEMNATION AND PUNISHMENT, IS ENTITLED TO BE HEARD- AND TO MAKE HIS DEFENCE---------------------------- IN HIS MOTHER TONGUE---------------.------- IT IS FOR THE COURT, AS PART OF THE CONDUCT OF A FAIR TRIAL, TO ENSURE THAT- SATISFACTORY TRANSLATION/INTERPRETATION FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THAT- PURPOSE.------------------------------------------  THAT PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE- DEVELOPED---------------, AS THE PRIMARY-ARM OF ANY-LANGUAGE POLICY, FOR IT- CONSTITUTES A-UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHT, GOING FAR BEYOND RULES REGULATING THE USE- OF WELSH OR SIMILAR TRADITIONAL LANGUAGES. IT APPLIES-WITH EQUAL-FORCE TO THE- FOREIGN VISITOR ACCUSED OF SHOPLIFTING IN LONDON'S OXFORD STREET.------ WHEREVER ANY- PERSON IS--- ENGAGED WITH---- THE MODERN STATE, FOR THE PURPOSE OF EITHER SECURING A- BENEFIT OR AVOIDING-A PENALTY, THE MOTHER-TONGUE PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE ASSIDUOUSLY- UPHELD.-----------------------------  THIS----- "MOTHER-TONGUE-----" PRINCIPLE---------------- IS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED, AS A MATTER OF COMMON LAW AND COURT PRACTICE.------ IT- SHOULD BE EXPLICITLY EXTENDED,-HOWEVER, TO ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL-----------------------------EITHER--------------- FACES POTENTIAL ADVERSE--CONSEQUENCES--- (E.G. INCLUDING CUSTOMS-OR IMMIGRATION INVESTIGATIONS)-------------------------------- OR---------------- STANDS TO GAIN OR LOSE A VALUABLE PUBLIC-BENEFIT, ACCORDING TO THE OUTCOME OF THE- PROCEEDINGS.---------------------------------  II------ COMMUNAL----------------------------------------  THE SECOND GROUP OF PRINCIPLES IS COMMUNAL, OR COLLECTIVE,- IN CHARACTER.------ FOR EACH SOCIETY-----------, THE FUNCTIONAL NEED IS FOR A- THREE-WAY CLASSIFICATION OF LANGUAGES, AS-DEPLOYED BY THE-STATE- WITHIN THE- BOUNDARIES OF ITS TERRITORY.------------------------------------------------  FIRST-----------: EVERY STATE NEEDS,-AS A--- PREREQUISITE OF A SETTLED CIVIC ORDER, AN------ OFFICIAL LANGUAGE--------.--------- THIS IS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF STATE, THE LANGUAGE OF OFFICIAL--- PRONOUNCEMENTS, THE LANGUAGE OF STATUTORY LEGISLATION, THE LANGUAGE OF--- OFFICIAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS AND-ORDERS,-OF THE CREATION OF NEW OBLIGATIONS--- AND PUNISHMENTS AND BENEFITS.------EXPERIENCE-SUGGESTS THAT THERE SHOULD--- PREFERABLY BE A----SINGLE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE----.------ WHERE STATES HAVE TWO OR MORE--- OFFICIAL LANGUAGES--- (IRELAND, CANADA)---- IT IS EASY FOR DIFFERENCES OF--- INTERPRETATION TO GENERATE UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION, IF-NOT CONFLICT.------UNDER THE GOVERNMENT--- OF WALES ACT, IT WAS INITIALLY-INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE BOTH--- ENGLISH AND WELSH AS HAVING--- JOINT OFFICIAL LANGUAGE STATUS,---- BUT THAT--- PLAN WAS ABANDONED AT AN EARLY STAGE.------------------------------------------------------------------------  SECOND-----------: SOCIAL CONVENTION AND HISTORY--- MAY SUPPORT THE IDENTIFICATION OF A------ TRADITIONAL--- LANGUAGE--------, A LANGUAGE OF CULTURE, LEARNING AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE,--- WHICH MAY BE HABITUALLY SPOKEN BY A LARGE NUMBER OF CITIZENS BUT WHICH IS NOT--- THE---------------------------- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE---------------.------ WELSH--- IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SUCH A TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, AS IS GAELIC IN IRELAND, AND--- BRETON IN BRITTANY.------ IN THIS RESPECT, A SINGLE STATE MAY ACCOMMODATE--- WITHIN ITS BORDERS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AT--- PROVINCIAL OR REGIONAL LEVEL AND IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH--- DIFFERENTIATION WITHIN A PROVINCIAL FRAME--- (CATALAN IN CATALUNYA, BRETON IN BRITTANY, CORNISH IN--- CORNWALL)----.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THIRD-----------: ALL SOCIETIES MUST NOW, GIVEN--- THE INCREASED ETHIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY-WITHIN EACH SOCIETY, DEPLOY A RANGE OF------ COMMUNAL--- LANGUAGES--------, BEING-LANGUAGES OTHER THAN THE INDIGENOUS--- TRADITIONAL------- LANGUAGE, BUT WHICH ARE SPOKEN BY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES, AND--- WHICH MAY STILL BE THE MOTHER-TONGUE OF NEWLY-ARRIVED MIGRANTS OR ELDERLY RESIDENTS--- WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LEARN ENGLISH SATISFACTORILY.---------------  EACH STATE SHOULD SPELL OUT, BY LAW, THE SCOPE OF THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES- OF LANGUAGE, AND THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS.------ IN THE- UK, THE NEED IS FOR PRIMARY LEGISLATION, PREFERABLY WITHOUT IMITATION TO WALES.------ THIS ESSAY SETS OUT THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH SUCH- LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PREPARED.----------------------------------------  OFFICIAL LANGUAGE-----------------  THE UK SHOULD DESIGNATE A SINGLE--- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE----, BINDING UPON ALL ITS- TERRITORIES.------ ALL OFFICIAL- STATEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS, INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN, BENEFITS CONFERRED SHOULD AS A- MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BE-REQUIRED TO BE STATED IN THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE,- AND CLEARLY EXPRESSED. THIS PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A MATTER OF COMMON LAW,- AND IS EMBODIED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION--- (-----"INTERPRETATION-----")----- APPLIED BY THE COURTS IN DECIDING THE MEANING OF STATUTES AND STATUTORY- INSTRUMENTS (I.E.--- PRIMARY---- AND--- SECONDARY---- LEGISLATION).----------------------------------------------------------------- AND IN THIS SENSE, WHETHER WITH EXPRESS STATUTORY PROVISION OR NOT, THE----------------------------- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE--------------- OF WALES IS ENGLISH.--------  THIS PRINCIPLE EXTENDS TO PUBLIC REQUIREMENTS ISSUED UNDER LEGISLATION, MADE- BY ANY ARM OF GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL, PROVINCIAL OR LOCAL: IN A HIGHLY MOBILE- SOCIETY, THE MOST COMMON OF THESE TAKES THE FORM OF HIGHWAY SIGNAGE, BUT THE- PRINCIPLE ALSO APPLIES TO THE CONDUCT OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, BOTH-CRIMINAL- AND CIVIL.------ A FURTHER VITAL FEATURE OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY IS THE- INFORMATIONAL LEAFLET, PARTICULARLY IN THE WELFARE SECTOR, AND THIS MAY SHADE- INTO BINDING OR PROCEDURAL OR ADVISORY ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTIVES, AFFECTING A- CITIZEN'S POSITION.------ ALL SUCH----- "OFFICIAL-----" STATEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE IN THE- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE. THE SAME SHOULD HOLD TRUE OF--- OFFICIAL---- PUBLIC RECORDS- OF PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PARLIAMENTARY AND CIVIL SERVICE RECORDS; WHERE- ANY STATEMENT WAS MADE, IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN ANY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN THE- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, THE RECORD SHOULD ALWAYS CARRY AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION.------- AND IN ALL CASES, THE---------------------------- OFFICIAL LANGUAGE ALONE--------------- SHOULD GENERATE LEGAL EFFECT.-----------------------------------------  TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE----------------  FOR MOST PARTS OF- THE UK, THERE IS NO LANGUAGE CAPABLE OF CONTENDING FOR DESIGNATION AS A- TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, OTHER THAN ENGLISH ITSELF.------ BUT IN WALES, THE WELSH- LANGUAGE IS THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, OCCUPYING A VERY DISTINCTIVE POSITION,- HISTORICALLY, CULTURALLY AND POLITICALLY.------ THIS STATUS HAS ALREADY BEEN- RECOGNISED BY THE WELSH LANGUAGE LEGISLATION, THE PROVISION OF S4C TELEVISION,- AND THE WORK OF THE WELSH LANGUAGE BOARD.------ INDEED, IN SOME RESPECTS, THIS- LEGISLATION HAS ALREADY CONFERRED ON THE WELSH LANGUAGE GREATER CURRENCY THAN A- TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE SHOULD NECESSARILY, AS A MATTER OF GENERAL PRINCIPLE,- ENJOY.--------  BUT THE CONCEPT OF A TRADITIONAL- LANGUAGE SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FURTHER, BY WAY OF NEW STATUTORY ENTITLEMENT.---------------------------------------------------  PLACE NAMES--------------- SHOULD BE DESIGNATED IN------ EITHER-------- THE OFFICIAL--------- OR-------- THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, BUT NO OTHER.------ EVERY PLACE SHOULD--- BE ACCORDED ONE NAME AND ONE NAME ONLY,-WHICHEVER THE LANGUAGE OF CHOICE. THE CHOICE OF--- LANGUAGE SHOULD BE A MATTER FOR DECISION BY THE MOST RELEVANT LOCAL AUTHORITY:--- CARDIFF CITY COUNCIL SHOULD DECIDE ON THE NAMING OF CARDIFF (EITHER--- CARDIFF------ OR--- CAERDYDD----, BUT NOT BOTH).------ FOR DINAS POWIS, THE RELEVANT--- AUTHORITY WOULD BE THE DINAS POWIS-COMMUNITY COUNCIL.---------------------------------------------  PUBLIC FACILITIES--------------- COULD, AT THE----DISCRETION-OF THE RELEVANT-AUTHORITY,-ALSO BE DESIGNATED IN EITHER LANGUAGE--- - CEMETERY---- OR--- MYNWENT,--- SCHOOL---- OR--- YSGOL, CHURCH---- OR--- EGLWYS, MUSEUM---- OR--- AMGUEDDFA.------------------------------------------  PUBLIC DOCUMENTS---------------: IN THE CASE OF SPECIFIC PUBLIC DOCUMENTS--- (WHETHER BEARING COERCIVE--- FORCE OR MERELY ADVISORY)---- THE STATE SHOULD ALWAYS, IF PROPERLY REQUESTED--- BY A CITIZEN TO DO SO, MAKE THEM AVAILABLE IN THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, AS--- WELL AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.------ THERE SHOULD BE------ NO REQUIREMENT-------- THAT ALL--- PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE------ (UNLESS OF COURSE THE MOTHER-TONGUE PRINCIPLE WERE ENGAGED)----.------ AND THE STATE SHOULD--- HAVE THE RESIDUAL POWER TO DETERMINE A REQUEST TO BE VEXATIOUS OR OTHERWISE--- WITHOUT PROPER FOUNDATION.--------------------------------------  ACTIVE SUPPORT--------------- SHOULD BE GIVEN BY THE STATE FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE--- TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE, BOTH WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND OTHERWISE. IN--- WALES, EDUCATION AUTHORITIES SHOULD MAKE MANY MORE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR--- RESIDENTS SEEKING TO LEARN WELSH.-----------------  THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY SHOULD ALWAYS RETAIN A JURISDICTION TO AVOID--- DUAL-LANGUAGE DEPLOYMENT WHERE OTHER OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS APPLY.--------- FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS A DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE FEATURE OF WELSH HIGHWAY--- SIGNAGE THAT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS ARE CONVEYED IN------ BOTH ENGLISH AND WELSH--------,--- THUS RUNNING THE RISK OF CONFUSED PERCEPTIONS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE HIGHWAY--- SAFETY SHOULD BE THE PRIME CONCERN.----------------------------------------  COMMUNAL LANGUAGES--------------------------------------------------  THE STATUS OF COMMUNAL LANGUAGES------------------ WILL INCREASE IN IMPORTANCE, AS-THE INCIDENCE OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION--- INCREASES, AND NEW ETHNIC AND CULTURAL GROUPINGS BECOME ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE--- TERRITORY OF EACH STATE.------ PROCEDURES SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE--- OFFICIAL DESIGNATION OF A LANGUAGE,---- WITHIN ANY TERRITORIAL UNIT OF GOVERNANCE,-------------------------------------- AS A COMMUNAL LANGUAGE---------------.-------------------------------------------  FOR THOSE SPEAKING MINORITY FOREIGN LANGUAGES---------------,--- THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE BOUND TO BE (A) LEARNING THE OFFICIAL--- LANGUAGE, AND (B) BENEFITTING FROM THE MOTHER-TONGUE PRINCIPLE.------ BUT IF A--- COMMUNITY BECAME FIRMLY ESTABLISHED WITHIN ANY LOCALITY--- (WHICH IS THE--- COMMON EXPERIENCE OF MIGRATING GROUPS)---- THEIR SETTLEMENT SHOULD BE--- RECOGNISED IN OTHER WAYS.------ FOR EXAMPLE, CULTURAL GRANT FACILITIES SHOULD----BE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE CULTIVATION OF COMMUNAL LANGUAGES AND-CULTURES, AND--- INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL FOR PUBLIC ADVISORY DOCUMENTATION TO--- BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNAL-LANGUAGE--- (E.G. AS MANY EDUCATIONAL--- AUTHORITIES-PROVIDE FOREIGN-LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS OF MATERIAL RELEVANT TO--- CHILDREN'S EDUCATION)----.---------------------------------  THE WELSH--- ASSEMBLY IS WELL SUITED--------------- TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW STATUTORY--- FRAMEWORK, POINTING THE WAY AHEAD, INTERNATIONALLY, FOR THIS DIMENSION-OF UK--- PUBLIC LIFE.------ WITHIN THE UK, IT IS ONLY IN WALES THAT THE-----RELEVANCE OF--- THESE ISSUES IS-WIDELY PERCEIVED AND---- UNDERSTOOD.------ THERE SHOULD BE NO----QUESTION OF ANY---- CRUDE STAND-OFF BETWEEN THE PROTAGONISTS OF ENGLISH AND THE------- DEVOTEES OF WELSH.------ THE ISSUE IS A MUCH MORE---- PROFOUND ONE, GOING TO THE--- DIGNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF---- EACH INDIVIDUAL WITHIN MODERN SOCIETY.------------------------------------  WALES SHOULD TAKE THE---- INTERNATIONAL LEAD---------------,--- WITH THE PROMOTION OF---- A NEW UK LANGUAGE ACT, EMBODYING THE---- ABOVE PRINCIPLES.--------------------   A LANGUAGE POLICY FOR WALES-----------------------------  RESPONSE TO ROGER WARREN EVANS BY FABIAN CHRIS CASTLE-----  CJI-CASTLE@CYMRU.NEW.LABOUR.ORG.UK------------------------------  RWE HAS OFFERED US A REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE---- WELSH PEOPLE-S COMMONLY-HELD ASSUMPTIONS, MISAPPREHENSIONS,---- PREJUDICES AND IGNORANCE WITH HIS OBVIOUS GOODWILL TOWARDS NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGES.----- HOWEVER, ASSUMPTIONS MISAPPREHENSIONS, PREJUDICES AND IGNORANCE ARE FEATURES OF HIS ESSAY.------------  I WILL ARGUE THAT THESE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES LEAD TO A CONFUSION OF LANGUAGE AND ETHNICITY.-- A CONFUSION, WHICH IS THE MOST DISGRACEFUL ASPECT OF THE---- "LANGUAGE ISSUE".-----------------------------------  HOWEVER, I WISH TO BEGIN----------------------- WITH TWO MORE OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF---- LINGUISTIC PREJUDICE.----------  (1) IN AN OTHERWISE LIBERAL-MINDED ARTICLE ON LANGUAGES AND THEIR---- VALUE (---YOU ARE WHAT YOU SPEAK-------- NEW SCIENTIST---- 30 NOVEMBER 02) A SUBTLE---- "PRO-ENGLISH" LINGUISTIC CHAUVINISM BECAME EVIDENT. THE---- LINGUIST SLOBIN HAS DONE RESEARCH INTO THE WAY THAT A---- GROUP OF LANGUAGES--- (INCLUDING ENGLISH)---- HAVE "COLOURFUL" VERBS---- WHICH EXPRESS MOVEMENT IN TERMS THAT ARE "DYNAMIC, FULL OF ENERGY".---- OTHER LANGUAGES--- (INCLUDING ROMANCE LANGUAGES)---- ARE DESCRIBED HAS HAVING "PROSAIC VERBS" AND "LACKING COLOURFUL VERBS". ALL THESE TERMS ARE VALUE LADEN. WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO CONSIDER WHY ENGLISH/RUSSIAN ETC ARE SO "SUBJECTIVE" IN COMPARISONS WITH "OBJECTIVE" ROMANCE LANGUAGES? ARE FRENCH/SPANISH ETC REALLY "LACKING"?----IN THIS CONTEXT I ASK READERS TO NOTE RWE-S USE OF THE WORDS---- "DEVOTEE", "PROTAGONISTS", "UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION",---- AND "[THE] DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE [BILINGUAL] HIGHWAY SIGNAGE.---------"  (2) MY SECOND EXAMPLE IS PAUL STARLING-S--- WELSH MIRROR----.----- READERS OF--- PLANET---- MAGAZINE WILL BE AWARE OF PATRICK---- MCGUINESS-S CLOSE READINGS OF THE--- DAILY MIRROR-S---- WELSH EDITION.----- PATRICK HAS SHOWN THAT BY CAREFULLY SELECTIVE TRANSLATION AND---- OMISSION THE MIRROR IS CONFLATING ALL WELSH LANGUAGE ACTIVISTS---- AND WELSH SPEAKERS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT FORMS OF NATIONALISM,---- XENOPHOBIA, AND NAZI-ISM. THE--- MIRROR----- IS CAREFUL TO---- SEPARATE "DECENT WELSH-SPEAKERS" FROM THIS, BUT IN------- MIRROR---- TERMS THESE CAN ONLY BE THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED TO STAY---- SILENT IN THE FACE OF LINGUISTIC BIGOTRY FROM ANY ENGLISH---- SPEAKERS WITH NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS WELSH. THE TRUE---- HORROR IS THAT LABOUR HQ AT TRANSPORT HOUSE CARDIFF,---- AND SOME LABOUR REPRESENTATIVES, ARE IMPLICATED IN THIS---- BLACK PROPAGANDA.-------------------------------------------  DIMENSIONS OF LANGUAGE POLICY, AS PROPOSED BY RWE, WHICH--NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED-----------------------------------------------------------  "PERSONAL RIGHTS------------------------------------------------------"  THE "MOTHER-TONGUE PRINCIPLE" COULD LEAD TO UNINTENTIONAL-- BUT INSTITUTIONAL RACISM.------ "MOTHER TONGUE" DENOTES---- ONES LANGUAGE OF ETHNIC ORIGIN.- MANY SIKHS MAY HAVE---- PUNJABI AS THEIR MOTHER-TONGUE, YET ENGLISH MAY BE THEIR---- LANGUAGE OF CHOICE, THEY MAY BE MORE COMFORTABLE SPEAKING---- ENGLISH AWAY FROM THE HOME. USING THEIR MOTHER-TONGUE IN---- DEALINGS WITH THE STATE, HOWEVER, MAY BE AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR---- THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR ETHNIC IDENTITY. A RIGHT TO USE PUNJABI---- IN RELATIONS WITH THE STATE, IF IT IS PROVIDED FOR ONE GROUP,---- MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL WHO SPEAK PUNJABI - INCLUDING SIKH---- CONVERTS WHO MAY BE NON-ARYAN.- PUNJABI IN THIS CASE BECOMES A---- COMMUNAL LANGUAGE, NOT AN ETHNIC LANGUAGE. A CLOSE READING OF---- RWE-S ESSAY WILL REVEAL THAT- "ETHNIC LANGUAGE" IS A BETTER---- DESCRIPTION WHAT HE OUTLINES.---------  ENGLISH IS MY MOTHER TONGUE,- BUT WELSH IS MY CHOSEN COMMUNAL---- LANGUAGE IN DEALINGS WITH THE STATE (FORM FILLING, ADVICE---- LINES ETC). THIS, FOR ME, IS AN IMPORTANT SIGNIFIER THAT I-----HAVE REINSTATED THE "CYMREICTOD---" (WELSHNESS)---- OF MY FATHER----'S FAMILY WHO WERE BULLIED AND CAJOLED INTO RAISING THEIR---- CHILDREN AS MONOGLOT ENGLISH SPEAKERS.-------------  WELSH IS LIKELY TO BE-MY-LANGUAGE OF CHOICE IN-COURT IF I EVER---- FEEL IT NECESSARY TO ENGAGE IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.---- SPEAKING WELSH IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF MY SENSE OF IDENTITY BUT---- THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT DEFINE MY ETHNICITY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.---- I HAVE ARGUED LONG AND HARD IN THE WELSH LANGUAGE MEDIA---- AGAINST ARGUMENTS FOR "CYMREICTOD ETHNIG---" (ETHNIC WELSHNESS)----.------------------------------------------------------------------  "COMMUNAL/COLLECTIVE RIGHTS------------------------------------------------" >  WHILST RWE-S ASSERTION, THAT TWO OFFICIAL AND---- EQUAL---- LANGUAGES CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL---- DOCUMENTS, IS CORRECT, THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ARGUE AGAINST-----MAKING WELSH AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.- I FAIL TO SEE ANY LOGICAL---- REASON OR EVEN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE CREATION OF A--- SUBORDI---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NATE OFFICIALCIAL LANGUAGES---- WITHIN BRITISH TOWNS, COUNTIES OR REGIONS.----------- TURNING TO ROAD SAFETY, IF PROBLEMS EXIST DUE TO LINGUISTIC---- PROBLEMS WITH ROAD SIGNS, WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER---- CONFISCATING THE CARS AND LORRIES OF NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING---- DRIVERS THE SECOND THEY REACH DOVER.- I ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A---- PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF BILINGUAL ROAD SIGNAGE - THE---- CONFUSION IS USUALLY CAUSED BY ALTERNATING MONOGLOT ENGLISH---- AND WELSH SIGNAGE, OR BY CHANGING THE RELATIVE POSITION OF---- THE TWO LANGUAGES, SOMETIMES WITH WELSH ON TOP, SOMETIMES ENGLISH.----- BUT THE ONLY WAY TO "PROMOTE--WELSH IS TO MAKE IT--- VISIBLE,- AND---- ACCEPTED AS NORMAL----.- BILINGUAL ROAD SIGNS AND OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS---- ARE AMONGST THE BEST WAYS TO DO THIS.- RWE-S IDEA OF A---- "TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE" SEEMS DESIGNED TO MAKE WELSH---- DISAPPEAR FROM ANY AREAS THAT ARE NOT ETHNICALLY WELSH-SPEAKING----- I.E. WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE WELSH-SPEAKERS BORN AND BRED.-------------  MORE WELSH ASSEMBLY WORK MUST FIRST BE--- CARRIED OUT IN WELSH----.----- MORE WORK MUST BE DONE TO ASSIMILATE NON-WELSH SPEAKERS INTO---- THEIR NATURALLY WELSH-SPEAKING COMMUNITIES.- MOST-IMPORTANTLY, WE---- MUST TACKLE THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS WHICH-ARE---- "LINGUISTICALLY CLEANSING--THE TRADITIONAL HEARTLANDS OF THE---- WELSH LANGUAGE. THESE PROCESSES EXIST IN MANY PARTS OF BRITAIN.---- LANGUAGE DIFFERENCE HOWEVER MAKES THE EFFECT MORE OBVIOUS IN---- WELSH-SPEAKING AREAS.-------------  AS A PARTY, LABOUR MUST TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK AT THE PROVISION OF-- SOCIAL HOUSING. WE MUST FIND WAYS OF FUNDING REAL COUNCIL HOUSING-- AND CONSIDER MODIFYING THE RIGHT TO BUY. WE MUST BE PREPARED-- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN SOME CASES PROPERTY RIGHTS MILITATE --AGAINST THE WELFARE OF STABLE COMMUNITIES.--------------  LANGUAGE SHIFT IN WALES IS AN INDICATOR OF SOCIAL-- PROCESSES WHICH LABOUR IS FAILING EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE - LET ALONE-- DEAL WITH.- WE ARE NOT, AT PRESENT, PROTECTING WORKING-CLASS-- YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGHOUT BRITAIN - FROM CORNWALL TO BOURNMOUTH-- TO OXFORD TO ABERSOCH - ANYWHERE, IN FACT, WHERE THE RIGHT-- TO BUY A PRETTY VIEW, AN EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT OR A-- LUXURY APARTMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE-- WELFARE OF A COMMUNITY.----------------------------------  CHRIS CASTLE-----  CAERDYDD/CARDIFF----  CJI-CASTLE@CYMRU.NEW.LABOUR.ORG.UK----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
