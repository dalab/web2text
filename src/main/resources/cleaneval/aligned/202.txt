--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE- SYMBOLISM OF THE UNION JACK--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BY------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A.J.--FERRIS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE- SYMBOLISM OF THE UNION JACK OR THE UNION OF JACOB-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HOW THE UNION JACK WAS FORMED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I-----------------------------------------------------------------N A.D.1194, RICHARD I OF ENGLAND--INTRODUCED THE CROSS OF ST. GEORGE AS-THE STANDARD OF ENGLAND, AND THIS REMAINED THE--NATIONAL FLAG UNTIL THE UNION WITH SCOTLAND. IN 1603, KING JAMES VI OF SCOTLAND BECAME--JAMES I OF ENGLAND, AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE FIRST UNION JACK WAS FORMED IN 1606 BY THE--ADDITION OF THE CROSS OF-ST. ANDREW-WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEW FLAG. THE NAME--------- "UNION--JACK----------" CAME FROM KING JAMES, WHOSE NAME IS--------- "JACOBUS----------" IN LATIN,--AND--------- "JACOB----------- IN HEBREW. THEN IN 1801, THERE WAS FORMED THE MORE FAMILIAR--UNION JACK BY THE ADDITION OF THE CROSS OF ST. PATRICK, SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THE FLAGS---------OF SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND. THUS THE FORMATION OF THE UNION JACK CAME ABOUT AS THE RESULT--OF THE PROGRESSIVE MERGING OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES------- UNDER ONE--THRONE, THE THRONE OF-DAVID. THE COMPLETED UNION JACK THUS SYMBOLISES THE RE-UNION OF--JACOB.----------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE THREE COVENANTS ARE--SYMBOLISED-BY THE THREE FLAGS WHICH TOGETHER FORM THE-UNION JACK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------  WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW GOD--MADE THREE COVENANTS WITH HIS PEOPLE, THE FULFILMENT OF WHICH IN THE ANGLO-SAXON RACE--PROVES THAT-IT IS ISRAEL. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IF WE TAKE THE THREE FLAGS IN THE ORDER IN--WHICH THEY FORM THE UNION - SCOTLAND, IRELAND, AND ENGLAND --THEN THE THREE FLAGS--SYMBOLISE THE THREE COVENANTS IN THE ORDER GOD MADE THEM WITH ISRAEL. FOR THE SAKE OF--ILLUSTRATING THIS, A CHART OF THE THREE COVENANTS-------- (CHART 2)--------- IS SHOWN--AFTER THE FLAGS---------(CHART 1)--------- AND IN-CORRESPONDING ORDER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FIRST CHART----------------------------------------------------------------- SHOWS THE--SELECTION OF ABRAHAM TO BE THE FATHER OF THE SPECIALLY TRAINED RACE WHO WOULD TEACH THE---------REST OF HUMANITY HOW TO OVERCOME DISEASE AND FINALLY DEATH. THE MIND OF ABRAHAM LOOKED--FORWARD LIKE A SEARCHLIGHT TO THE----------------- " LATTER DAYS,---------" WHEN THE MANY--PROMISES MADE TO HIM CONCERNING HIS SEED WOULD BE FULFILLED. IN THE CORRESPONDING FLAG OF--ST. ANDREW WHICH FORMS THE BASE OF THE UNION JACK, THE BLUE BACKGROUND INDICATES THAT THE--POWER BEHIND THE DESTINY OF ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED WAS A HEAVENLY OR SPIRITUAL ONE, AND THAT--THE------- CHOSEN RACE WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME SUCH A PEOPLE. THE WHITE CROSS IS THE SIGN--OF MULTIPLICITY AND SYMBOLISES JACOB'S SUMMING UP OF THE ABRAHAMIC PROMISES AS HE PASSED--THEM ON TO EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH WITH HIS ARMS CROSSED, AND HIS HANDS UPON THEIR HEADS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SCOTLAND-ST.--ANDREW-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE- ABRAHAMIC COVENANT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WITH HIS HANDS--CROSSED, JACOB-PASSED ON THE BLESSINGS OF NATIONAL GREATNESS TO MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IRELAND-ST. PATRICK---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE- MOSAIC OR OLD COVENANT----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  WHICH WAS- BROKEN BY ISRAEL; THE BLESSINGS POSTPONED 2,520 YEARS, THE NEED OF A SAVIOUR.---------------------------------------------------------- <H.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLAND-ST. GE0RGE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE- NEW COVENANT OF REDEMPTION-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MADE IT POSSIBLE- FOR ISRAEL TO BECOME RULERS WORTHY OF GOD.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE- UNION OF JACOB---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ISRAEL- RULING WITH GOD---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I HAVE BLOTTED- OUT THY TRANSGRESSIONS (BROKEN COVENANT).------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CHART----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2  THE SECOND CHART---------- SHOWS THE FIRST STAGE IN GOD'S EDUCATION OF HIS SERVANT RACE BY THE REVELATION OF THE--DETAILS OF HIS LAW AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN ALL PHASES OF LIFE. GOD PROMISED THAT IF ISRAEL--KEPT THE TERMS OF THE MOSAIC LAW COVENANT, SHE WOULD THEN BE FIT TO BLESS THE WORLD AS HE--HAD PROMISED HER FATHERS. AT THAT SAME TIME, HE WARNED ISRAEL THAT THE BREAKING OF THE--LAWS IN THE COVENANT WOULD LEAD TO THE LONG PERIOD OF SCATTERING FOR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEVEN TIMES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" WE KNOW THAT ISRAEL DID BREAK THE LAW--AND SINNED AGAINST GOD, THUS SHOWING THEIR WEAKNESS AND INABILITY TO RISE TO THE HIGH--STANDARD SET. THEY LEARNT THE BITTER LESSON OF THEIR OWN SINFUL NATURE AND OF THE--IMPOSSIBILITY OF BECOMING GOD'S SERVANT WITHOUT SUPERNATURAL AID.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  WHEN THE FLAG OF-ST. PATRICK WAS--ADDED IN 1----TO-FORM THE UNION, IT WAS BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE IN ORDER TO LEAVE A WHITE--BORDER SHOWING BETWEEN THE RED CROSS AND THE BLUE BACKGROUND. THE BROKEN CROSS, OF COURSE,--REMARKABLY SIGNIFIED THAT ISRAEL BROKE THIS AGREEMENT WITH GOD. IT SHOWED ISRAEL AS A--DEFECTIVE PEOPLE, WHOSE SIN AND TRANSGRESSIONS WERE EVIDENCED BY THEIR FAILURE TO KEEP--GOD'S LAW. IT TAUGHT ISRAEL THE NEED OF AN OUTSIDE DIVINE AID TO MEND THEIR OWN BROKEN--LIVES - THE NEED OF A NEW CREATION. THE MOSAIC COVENANT REMINDED ISRAEL ALL THE TIME OF------------------------------------------------------------- BROKENNESS-------------------------------------------------------------, LACK OF PERFECTION, AND IT DEVELOPED IN--ISRAEL------------------------------------------------------------- A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE--OF RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH TO-DAY DISTINGUISHES ANGLO-SAXON PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER NATIONS.------------------------------------------------------------- THE FACT THAT THE CROSS IS------------------------------------------------------------- RED------------------------------------------------------------- TYPIFIES BLOOD. GOD ALLOWED CERTAIN TRANSGRESSIONS OF HIS LAW TO--BE FORGIVEN, PROVIDED THAT ISRAEL SACRIFICED VARIOUS ANIMALS IN DEATH. THE ANIMAL THUS--SUFFERED DEATH------------------------------------------------------------- INSTEAD OF------------------------------------------------------------- THE ISRAELITE. YET THOSE ANIMAL--SACRIFICES WENT ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NEVER OVERCAME HUMAN DEPRAVITY WHICH CAUSED--DEATH. BUT THROUGH THE SACRIFICES, GOD GRADUALLY REVEALED HIS PURPOSE THAT SOME-DAY------------------------------------------------------------- ONE SACRIFICE------------------------------------------------------------- WOULD BE-PAID WHICH-WOULD RELEASE ISRAEL,--NOT ONLY FROM TEMPORARY DISEASE, BUT-FROM DEATH-ITSELF.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE THIRD STAGE ON THE CHART--SHOWS THE------------------------------------------------------------- NEW COVENANT------------------------------------------------------------- BEING PUT INTO OPERATION.-WHEN CHRIST--APPEARED AT THE-COMMENCEMENT OF HIS MINISTRY, JOHN THE BAPTIST POINTED TO HIM, EXCLAIMING,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "BEHOLD,--THE LAMB OF GOD, WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" - (JOHN------- 1: 29.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------  LAMBS HAD BEEN USED IN THE OLD--COVENANT FOR MANY YEARS AS SACRIFICES-TO OBTAIN HEALING AND FORGIVENESS. NOW THE MESSIAH,--THOUGH PERFECT, WOULD HIMSELF SUFFER DEATH AS THE ONE SACRIFICIAL LAMB FOR ISRAEL AND THE--WHOLE WORLD, THAT FINALLY ALL MIGHT BE FORGIVEN AND RESTORED FROM DEATH. THROUGH BREAKING--THE MOSAIC LAW, THE NATION OF ISRAEL DIED, AND THEIR LAW SHOWED THEM WHY THEY DIED AS--INDIVIDUALS. THEY WERE A PEOPLE TYPIFIED BY A BROKEN CROSS. THEIR ONLY HOPE LAY IN THE--MERCY OF GOD BRINGING ABOUT A NEW CREATION. THEN CAME THE NEXT STAGE IN THEIR SPIRITUAL--EDUCATION, THE GRACE OF THE NEW COVENANT, BUT-ISRAEL HAD TO LEARN FIRST THE NEED OF A--SAVIOUR BEFORE THEY WOULD ACCEPT HIM AND BE IN A POSITION TO TEACH THE OTHER NATIONS TO--WAY OF LIFE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE THIRD FLAG OF THE UNION JACK,--THE CROSS OF ST. GEORGE, IS-THE VERY SHAPE OF THE CROSS OF CALVARY, SHOWING THAT IT DOES--REPRE- SENT THE NEW COVENANT OF TOTAL FORGIVENESS TO ISRAEL OF ALL HER TRANSGRESSIONS. IT--IS A RED CROSS, SIGNIFYING AGAIN-A BLOOD COVENANT. AT THE LAST SUPPER, CHRIST PASSED--AROUND THE CUP OF WINE, SAYING,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "FOR- THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT (COVENANT), WHICH IS SHED FOR MANY FOR THE REMISSION--OF SINS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" - (MATTHEW--26:28)----------------------------------------------------------------------  CHRIST THUS INTIMATED THAT HIS--OWN BLOOD WOULD BE SHED AS EVIDENCE THAT THE PRICE OF DEATH HAD BEEN PAID TO REDEEM ISRAEL--AND SAVE THE WORLD ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE WAY WAS THEN-CLEAR FOR GOD'S SERVANT TO BE--CLEANSED AND MADE PERFECT FOR MINISTRY; AND HE-EXTENDS THE INVITATION TO ISRAEL TO COME--BACK TO HIM-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "I--- HAVE-BLOTTED OUT--AS A THICK CLOUD THY TRANSGRESSIONS, AND AS-A-CLOUD, THY SINS: RETURN-UNTO ME; FOR 1 HAVE--REDEEMED---- THEE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------"- (ISAIAH 44: 22)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "I, EVEN I,---- AM HE-----THAT BLOTTETH OUT THY TRANSGRESSIONS FOR-MINE OWN SAKE, AND WILL NOT REMEMBER THY--SINS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------" -(ISAIAH 43: 25)----------------------------------------------------------------------  WHEN THE CROSS OF ENGLAND IS- PLACED OVER THE-BROKEN CROSS OF IRELAND TO FORM THE UNION, THE ABOVE-SCRIPTURES-ARE--DRAMATICALLY-SYMBOLISED.-THE BROKEN CROSS, WHICH, WE HAVE SEEN, REPRESENTS THE BROKEN--MOSAIC COVENANT,------------------------------------------------------------- IS BLOTTED--OUT-------------------------------------------------------------. IN THE UNION JACK, THE--BROKEN PORTION-IS STILL THERE, BUT COVERED UP BY THE CROSS OF ENGLAND. THIS PERFECTLY--SYMBOLISES THE FACT THAT THE CROSS OF CALVARY COVERS AND BLOTS OUT THE TRANSGRESSIONS OF--ISRAEL. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ISRAEL DISOBEYED GOD, AND BROKE HIS LAWS, RESULTING IN--DISPERSION, GOD HAS PROMISED TO------------------------------------------------------------------------- "REMEMBER THEIR SIN NO---- MORE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" HOW WELL THE COMPLETED UNION JACK--DEMONSTRATES THAT GOD HAS BLOTTED OUT ISRAEL'S TRANSGRESSIONS THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST.------------------------------------------------------------------------  THUS THE BRITISH PEOPLES, WHO OWN- THE UNION JACK, ARE PARTICULARLY THE NATIONS OF THE COVENANTS, OR THE----------------- "COVENANT--PEOPLE,---------" NOW RAPIDLY NEARING THE CONSUMMATION OF THEIR SPIRITUAL EDUCATION AND--PREPARATION AS GOD'S SERVANT NATION. SOON ISRAEL WILL BE FULLY UNITED WITH GOD AS HIS SONS--TO BLESS ALL NATIONS. WHEN JACOB OF OLD PREVAILED WITH GOD AT---- PENIEL-----, THE LORD--CHANGED HIS NAME TO----------------- "ISRAEL-------------------" WHICH MEANS--------- "A--PRINCE OR SON OF GOD.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"  "AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, WHAT- IS THY NAME ?----------------------------------------------------------------- . . .--- THY NAME SHALL BE CALLED NO MORE JACOB, BUT ISRAEL , FOR AS A--PRINCE-------- HAST-------- THOU POWER WITH GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAST PREVAILED.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" - (GENESIS--32: 24-28)----------------------------------------------------------------------  PARALLEL WITH THE FORMATION OF- THE UNION JACK, MORE AND MORE OF JACOB'S DESCENDANTS HAVE BECOME EXPERIMENTALLY SONS OF--GOD, TRULY GOD'S------------------------------------------------------------- ISRAEL-------------------------------------------------------------. DURING THE DAYS OF ENGLAND UNDER THE--CROSS OF ST. GEORGE, THERE COMMENCED THE ABANDONMENT OF IDOLATRY, AND THE START OF THE--PROTESTANT REFORMATION. IN THE DAYS OF THE UNION BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND, THERE CAME--THE DEEPER SPIRITUAL AWAKENING IN THE WESLEYAN-REVIVALS. THEN, UNDER THE COMPLETED UNION--JACK, THERE COMMENCED THE WORLD-WIDE MINISTRY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON MISSIONARY AND BIBLE--SOCIETIES. THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A FULLER-GOSPEL INCLUDING THE TRUTH OF THE SECOND--ADVENT OF CHRIST, WHILE TO-DAY THE GOSPEL OF-THE KINGDOM IS BEING CROWNED BY THE--ANGLO-ISRAEL AWAKENING, AND THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  PARALLEL WITH THIS PROGRESSIVE- RETURN OF ANGLO-SAXON ISRAEL-TO THE GOD-OF THEIR FATHERS, THERE HAS TAKEN PLACE THE--PROMISED MULTIPLICATION AND EXPANSION-OF THE RACE OVER THE EARTH-TO FORM THE--EPHRAIM-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS, AND-THE MANASSEH-AMERICAN GREAT REPUBLIC. FROM--1194 TO 1606, THE-PERIOD OF ENGLAND UNDER THE SINGLE CROSS, THE EARTH WAS ALMOST--UNEXPLORED. TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THIS PERIOD, THE FIRST ATTEMPTS AT COLONISATION WERE MADE--IN AMERICA. BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, ENGLAND DEFEATED THE SPANISH ARMADA, WHICH GAVE HER--DOMINION OF THE SEA, THE SURE FOUNDATION OF ENGLAND'S FUTURE GREATNESS. IN THE NEXT--PERIOD, UNDER THE ELEMENTARY UNION JACK, 1606 TO 1800, THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS BORN BY THE--CONQUEST OF INDIA AND CANADA, AND BY THE ANNEXATION OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA; WHILE THE UNITED--STATES EMERGED BY THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THEN THE THIRD AND FINAL PERIOD UNDER--THE COMPLETED UNION JACK, 1801 TO 1941+ HAS WITNESSED THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRITISH--COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS AND THE GREAT REPUBLIC OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE NOW--LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMING RE-UNION OF BRITAIN AND AMERICA, AND TO THE UNIFICATION OF THE--WHOLE HOUSE OF------------------------------------------------------------- JACOB-ISRAEL--UNITED WITH GOD-------------------------------------------------------------, TO BLESS ALL--NATIONS.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  PSALM 60:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4  'TIS----- THY FLAG AND MY FLAG,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  THE----- BEST OF FLAGS ON EARTH.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SO----- CHERISH IT MY CHILDREN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IT'S----- YOURS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  YOUR----- FATHERS FOUGHT,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  YOUR----- FATHERS DIED,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TO----- RAISE IT TO THE SKIES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  AND----- WE LIKE THEM MUST NEVER YIELD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BUT----- KEEP IT FLYING HIGH.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
