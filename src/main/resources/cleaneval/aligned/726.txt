THE AUTHOR, WHO ENGINEERED THESE AND MANY OTHER SESSIONS -----------FOR THE BAND, DISCUSSES THE QUADRAPHONIC RECORD PRODUCTION, AND CONTRASTS------------IT WITH THE PRESENTATION OF MULTICHANNEL SOUND ON STAGE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANY-YEARS AGO,-IN THE EARLIER -----------PART OF THEIR CAREER, PINK FLOYD HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING-WITH A DEVICE----------- INSCRUTABLY KNOWN AS THE-AZIMUTH COORDINATOR. IT WAS NOT A-MAGIC BOX----------- FOR ALIGNING TYPE MACHINE HEADS AS THE NAME MIGHT SUGGEST BUT A VERY----------- GLORIFIED-TERM FOR WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS A QUAD PAN POT. ITS USE AT LIVE----------- CONCERTS AT THAT TIME VERY LIKELY INSPIRED CONSIDERABLE AUDIENCE INTEREST----------- IN MULTICHANNEL SOUND SYSTEMS AND IN-A MILD WAY MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED----------- TOWARDS THE NOW BOOMING INDUSTRY OF QUADRAPHONY. MANY GROUPS HAVE RECENTLY----------- ADOPTED QUADRAPHONIC PA SYSTEMS FOR-LIVE SHOWS,-THE SIZE AND POWER OF------------WHICH SEEM-TO BE INCREASING. QUADRAPHONIC RECORD SALES ARE ALSO ON THE------------INCREASE, DESPITE THE INDECISION BOTH ON THE PART OF THE PUBLIC AND----------- RECORD COMPANIES ABOUT WHICH OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS PROVIDE THE BEST----------- RESULTS AND COMPATIBILITY.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRACTICALLY----------- ALL NON-CLASSICAL RECORDINGS ARE MADE USING CLOSE MIC TECHNIQUES IN----------- RELATIVELY DEAD STUDIO ACOUSTICS-AND LATER PREMIXED TO A STEREO-MASTER----------- TAPE. EXACTLY THE SAME RECORDING PROCEDURES CAN APPLY FOR A QUADRAPHONIC----------- RECORD EXCEPT THAT, BECAUSE THE MASTER REDUCTION IS MADE TO FOUR CHANNELS----------- RATHER THAN TWO, THE MULTITRACK LAYOUT MUST ALLOW AN EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION----------- OF SOUNDS FOR ADAPTING TO QUAD. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE POSSIBLE---------- POSITIONS- IN A FOUR CHANNEL REMIX, AND CONFLICT MAY ARISE WITH TRACK---------- GROUPINGS- ORGANIZED WITH STEREO ON MIND. ALTHOUGH DARK SIDE OF THE---------- MOON WAS MONITORED- IN STUDIOS EQUIPPED FOR STEREO REPRODUCTION, MANY---------- SECTIONS WERE RECORDED- WITH REGARD TO THE EVENTUAL QUADRAPHONIC REDUCTION,---------- EVEN THOUGH THIS- TOOK MORE TRACK SPACE THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY---------- FOR STEREO. FOR- EXAMPLE, THE CLOCK SOUNDS FOR TIME WERE BUILT IN AN---------- IMAGINARY QUAD PICTURE- ON TO FOUR TRACKS OF-THE 16 TRACK MASTER. THE---------- SOUNDS HEARD ON THE INTRODUCTION- TO--- MONEY---- WERE ALSO DISTRIBUTED---------- ACROSS FOUR TRACKS TO ENABLE THE- SPATIAL SHIFTS OF THE QUAD REDUCTION.---------- THIS INVOLVED TRANSFER FROM AN- EDITED TAPE LOOP ON A FOUR TRACK MACHINE---------- TO THE 16 TRACK FOR SUBSEQUENT- OVERDUBS SO THAT EACH SOUND ISSUED---------- FROM A DIFFERENT SPEAKER.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MERELY REDISTRIBUTING THE SOUND----------- FOR THE QUAD MIX, HOWEVER, IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY. THE VARIOUS----------- QUAD SYSTEMS FOR WHICH THE ALBUM IS INTENDED HAVE TO BE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BORNE---------- IN MIND. EMI HAVE ADOPTED THE SQ SYSTEM FOR DISC ISSUES. AS WITH ALL---------- MATRIX SYSTEMS IT HAS SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF SIGNALS---------- ARE POSITIONED ANYWHERE IN THE AREA BETWEEN CENTRE-OF-THE-ROON AND---------- CENTER BACK THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE OUT OF PHASE TO SOME DEGREE WHEN---------- ENCODED AND CUT IN TWO DISC CHANNELS. THIS RESULTS IN A CONSIDERABLE---------- DROP IN LEVEL, DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE CHANNEL LIMITATIONS OR EVEN A---------- TOTAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SIGNAL IN MONO, SO THIS HAS TO BE AVOIDED---------- WHEREVER POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH A PAN THROUGH THIS CENTER AREA MIGHT PASS---------- UNNOTICED SINCE LEVEL VARIATIONS WOULD BE LESS OBJECTIONABLE IN A MOVING---------- PICTURE.----------------------------- WHEN APPROACHING THE QUAD MIX OF THE ALBUM IT HAD TO BE EMPHASIZED---------- THAT THE CONTENTS SHOULD BE UNCHANGED MUSICALLY, BUT BE A----- `SHOWCASE'----- FOR---------- THE QUAD MEDIUM AND AVOID-THE MORE OBVIOUS-GIMMICKS OF PANNING ETC.-----------THE REQUIREMENTS WERE A DISCRETE MASTER FOR TAPE SYSTEMS, AND AN ENCODED---------- SQ MASTER FOR DISC TRANSFER. IT WAS THOUGHT THAT TWO SEPARATE REMIXES ----------WOULD BE THE IDEAL SITUATION, FOR IN THAT CASE EACH SYSTEM COULD BE---------- USED O ITS FULLEST CAPABILITIES WITHOUT COMPROMISE ON ACCOUNT OF THE---------- OTHER. HOWEVER, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUCH HUGE DIFFERENCES IN QUAD---------- EFFECT BETWEEN THE TWO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCOMPATIBLE WITH---------- EACH OTHER MUSICALLY; FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EFFECT OF FOLLOWING DISC---------- AND TAPE CARTRIDGE.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANOTHER CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVE---------------- WAS TO REMIX TO DISCRETE AND SQ SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS WOULD HAVE---------------- PRESENTED A CONSIDERABLE DEMAND ON-MACHINERY,-ESPECIALLY AS MANY---------------- OTHER TAPE MACHINES WOULD BE IN USE-FOR QUAD ECHO DELAY, AUTOMATIC---------------- DOUBLE-TRACKING (A TECHNIQUE USING A FAST DELAY) AND SO ON. EVERY---------------- EDIT WOULD THEN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HAVE---------------- TO BE DUPLICATED ON BOTH SYSTEMS; CROSSFADES WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE,---------------- NEEDED THREE FOUR TRACK MACHINES AND THREE STEREO MACHINES QUITE---------------- APART FROM THE EXTRA TIME INVOLVED AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF---------------- LINEUP PROCEDURES. IT WAS EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO WORK WITH ONE---------------- DISCRETE FOUR TRACK TAPE AND MONITOR IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ASSURED---------------- A REASONABLE RESULT FOR BOTH SYSTEMS, IN OTHER WORDS BEARING---------------- IN MIND THE COMPROMISES IN THE SUBSEQUENT TWO-CHANNEL PROCESSING.---------------- THE QUAD REMIX ROOM AT EMI'-----S ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS---------------- HAS THE CONVENIENT FACILITY TO MONITOR A DISCRETE TAPE PASSED---------------- THROUGH A BACK-TO-BACK SQ ENCODE/DECODE ARRANGEMENT, AND ALSO---------------- THE STEREO RESULT DIRECT FROM THE TWO MATRIX CHANNELS WITHOUT---------------- DECODING. THUS, WE CAN MONITOR DISCRETE, SQ AND STEREO FROM JUST---------------- ONE FOUR TRACK TAPE. AN SQ MASTER WAS TO BE PREPARED SIMPLY BY---------------- MAKING A COPY OF THE FINAL EDITED AND CRUSADED FOUR TRACK TAPE---------------- THROUGH THE SQ ENCODER. THIS EXTRA GENERATION COULD BE SAVED---------------- IF IT WAS FELT NECESSARY BY DIRECT TRANSFER FROM AN ADVANCE HEAD---------------- FOUR TRACK MACHINE TO DISC VIA AN ENCODER, ALTHOUGH NORMAL PRACTICE---------------- IS TO PREPARE AN-INTERMEDIATE TWO CHANNEL-TAPE: AZIMUTH AND GENERATION---------------- DIFFICULTIES CAN BE OVERCOME BY CAREFUL ENGINEERING. HAVING DETERMINED---------------- THE MANNER IN WHICH THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS-COULD BE HANDLED FOR---------------- THE REDUCTION, THE PROBLEM OF QUAD POSITIONING AROSE.----------------------------------------- ON THE STEREO-VERSION THE BASIC INSTRUMENT POSITIONS WERE ARRANGED-AS IN FIG. 1 ADDITIONAL SOUNDS SUCH AS SYNTHESIZERS, EXTRA GUITARS-AND BACKING VOCALS WERE SPREAD ACROSS THE PICTURE IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS-FOR MAXIMUM FILLING OUT-OF THE MUSIC STAGE. THE STEREO-REMIX WAS BY-NO MEANS A SIMPLE ONE, MANY TRACKS HAVING TO BE-------POTTED'----- FOR----------- JUST A BAR OR TWO. THE 16 TRACK MASTER ITSELF WAS DERIVED FROM AN EARLIER----------- 16 (DOWN TO NINE-OR TEN TRACKS ON THE SECOND IN SOME CASES) IN ORDER----------- TO MAKE SPARE TRACKS AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER OVERDUBS. THIS DID NOT MAKE----------- THE-QUAD PICTURE----- `DESIGN'----- ANY EASIER. FOR INSTANCE, THE DRUMS---------- HAD BEEN MIXED TO STEREO ON THE SECOND GENERATION 16 TRACK WHICH, OWING---------- TO SQ LIMITATIONS, HAD TO BE SPREAD FROM LEFT TO FRONT RIGHT, LEAVING---------- BASS DRUM AND-SNARE CENTER-FRONT AND TOM TOMS SPREAD-IN STEREO ACROSS---------- THE FRONT OF THE ROOM. THE BASS GUITAR ALSO HAD TO REMAIN CENTER FRONT---------- FOR THE SAKE OF-THE SQ, BUT-THIS WAS NO GREAT PROBLEM AS-BASS FREQUENCIES---------- HAVE LITTLE DIRECTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE HARMONICS AND ATTACK---------- OF THE INSTRUMENT ARE NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG HERE. GUITAR WAS PLACED---------- REAR LEFT AND THE ELECTRIC PIANO REAR RIGHT.----------------------------- THE REVERBERATION SYSTEM USED THROUGHOUT THE QUAD REDUCTION WAS TWO---------- EMT REVERB PLATES: ONE WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT CHANNELS AND ONE---------- ACROSS THE REAR----- - BOTH FED FROM THE SAME SOURCE. THIS GAVE A VERY----------- FULL----- `INSIDE THE CHAMBER EFFECT'----- AND HELPED TO MINIMIZE THE---------------- `HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM'----- CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF---------- DIRECT SOUNDS THERE.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE---------- PIANO ON--- THE GREAT GIG-IN THE SKY---- IS A NATURAL QUAD RECORDING---------- MADE IN ABBEY ROAD STUDIO ONE (WHILE BASS AND DRUMS WERE PLAYING SIMULTANEOUSLY---------- IN TWO) USING TWO DISTANT MICROPHONES FOR BACK CHANNEL REVERBERATION.---------- THE FOUR TRACKS WERE SIMPLY COMBINED FOR THE STEREO VERSION.--------------- IN--- TIME---- THE ROTO-TOMS (TOM-TOMS TUNED BY ROTATING DRUMS-ON A---------- PIVOT TO STRETCH THE HEAD) WERE SPREAD ACROSS THE BACK-CHANNELS WHILE---------- MOST OF THE REMAINING INSTRUMENTS WER-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------E OVERDUBBED RATHER THAN LAID DOWN ON THE BASIC TRACK. THE KEPEX---------- SYSTEM WAS USED AS A NOISE GATE ON ALL THE 16 TRACKS-FOR THE REDUCTION,---------- AND ALSO IN THE EARLIER STAGES TO IMPROVE SEPARATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL---------- DRUMS ON THE-BASIC RECORDING. FURTHER USE OF KEPEX ENABLED DECAY TIMES---------- OF VARIOUS TRACKS TO BE ALTERED; THE HEARTBEAT ON THE INTRODUCTION---------- TO THE ALBUM WAS, IN FACT, A KEPEXED BASS DRUM.----------------------------  THE POSITIONING FOR QUAD REMIX WAS EFFECTED BY MEANS OF AN EXTERNAL---------- INSERTION UNIT CONTAINING SIXTEEN DUAL-CONCENTRIC PAN POTS (FRONT TO---------- BACK AND LEFT TO RIGHT). THESE WERE THEN FED INTO CHANNEL FADERS ON---------- THE MIXING CONSOLE IN THE NORMAL WAY. ANY MOVEMENT OR PANNING WAS ARRANGED---------- BY PATCHING IN EXTERNAL JOYSTICK PANPOTS TO THE APPROPRIATE TRACKS---------- AND THEN AGAIN RETURNED TO CHANNEL FADERS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  US----------- AND THEM-----IS PROBABLY THE MOST-INVOLVED PIECE OF QUAD TECHNIQUE---------- ON THE ALBUM. ON THE STEREO-VERSION A VOCAL LINE IS REPEATED BY MEANS---------- OF A VERY LONG TAPE ECHO-WHICH MOVES FROM THE LEFT TOWARDS THE RIGHT---------- ON EACH SUCCESSIVE REPEAT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE AN INTERESTING EFFECT---------- IN QUAD, EACH REPEAT WAS RETURNED TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL WHICH ENTAILED---------- USING A DIFFERENT TAPE SYSTEM FOR EACH REPEAT RATHER THAN RECYCLING---------- ONE SIGNAL BACK THROUGH THE SAME SYSTEM, AS ONE WOULD FOR A NORMAL---------- TAPE ECHO OR DIGITAL LOOP. IN ORDER TO DO THIS A HOOKUP HAD TO BE ARRANGED,---------- WITH AN EIGHT TRACK MACHINE AS IN FIG.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IT WILL BE NOTED THAT EACH REPEAT----------- INVOLVES TWO RECORD-REPLAY STAGES. THIS WAS NECESSARY TO ATTAIN THE----------- LENGTH OF DELAY NEEDED FOR THE PIECE AND IN FACT TO--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INCREASE---------- THE DELAY STILL FURTHER THE TAPE SPEED OF THE MACHINE WAS LOWERED.---------- BY THE TIME THE FOURTH REPEAT HAD ARRIVED ABOUT FOUR SECONDS AFTER---------- THE ORIGINAL SIGNAL IT HAD PASSED THROUGH EIGHT STAGES OF TAPE, SO---------- MACHINE AND DOLBY LINE UP WERE EXTREMELY CRITICAL. THIS CAUSED TROUBLES:---------- ORIGINALLY, THE RECORD/REPLAY EQUALIZATION WAS ACCURATELY SET, AS USUAL,---------- BUT THE RELATIVELY SLIGHT SPEED DEVIATION MEANT THAT, AT THE CHANGED---------- SPEED, SLIGHT TOP LIFT OCCURRED. AFTER EIGHT REPETITIONS THIS BECAME---------- RATHER UNUSABLE. IT WILL ALSO BE NOTICED THAT THE REPEAT FROM TRACK---------- EIGHT IS FED BACK INTO THE RECORD STAGE OF TRACK ONE SO-THAT A FURTHER---------- CYCLE TAKES PLACE. THUS: FIFTH REPEAT RETURNS LEFT FRONT, SIXTH RIGHT---------- FRONT AND SO ON. THE RESULT IS A ROUND-AND-ROUND-THE-ROOM EFFECT. THE---------- SYSTEM IS OPERATED BELOW UNITY GAIN HOWEVER, AND THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH---------- REPEATS ARE BARELY AUDIBLE.----------------------------- A SIMILAR TYPE OF DELAY IS USED IN--- ANY COLOR YOU LIKE---- ON SYNTHESIZERS.---------- RICHARD WRIGHT, WHEN OVERDUBBING ON TO THE SECTION, HEARD THE TAPE---------- REPEAT IN EARPHONES, AND PLAYED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE RESULT WAS CANONIC.-------------- OWING TO THE SHEER COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN---------- THE RECORDING OF DARK SIDE, MANY OF THE SOUNDS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE---------- TO REPRODUCE LIVE, EVEN WITH THE MOST INVOLVED EQUIPMENT. IT IS FOR---------- THIS REASON THAT PINK FLOYD USE A NUMBER OF PRERECORDED TAPES, REPRODUCED---------- IN QUAD ON A TEAC FOUR TRACK MACHINE, FOR THEIR CONCERT PROGRAMS. THE---------- TAPE IS OPERATED AT THE MIXING DESK WHICH IS SITUATED WITHIN THE HALL---------- IN THE AUDIENCE AREA. ONE UNUSUAL POINT ABOUT THE QUADRAPHONIC LAYOUT---------- FOR FLOYD CONCERTS CAN BE SEEN IN FIG---. RATHER THAN USE A CONVENTIONAL---------- DOUBLE STEREO SET UP, IE FRONT LEFT, RIGHT FRONT, LEFT BACK AND RIGHT---------- BACK, THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS ROTATED 45X. THIS HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER---------- A NORMAL SYSTEM.----------------------------- THE MAIN STEREO PA IS EXTREMELY LARGE AND POWERFUL (APPROVE 8 KW).---------- TO SET UP AN EQUALLY POWERFUL SYSTEM AT THE REAR CORNERS OF A CONCERT---------- HALL WOULD BE A MAMMOTH TASK, AND VERY IMPRACTICAL. EVEN WITH THE LAYOUT---------- SHOWN, ROAD CREWS HAVE A HARD TIME HUMPING HUGE CABINETS TO THE SIDES---------- AND BACK OF THE HALL, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE AUDITORIUM IS ON SEVERAL---------- LEVELS. THIS INVOLVES SPEAKER STACKS ON EVERY LEVEL TOGETHER WITH THEIR---------- ASSOCIATED CABLES, WHICH HAVE TO BE KEPT OUT OF THE WAY OF THE AUDIENCE.----------------------------- IT HAS BEEN FOUND VERY EFFECTIVE TO HAVE THE QUAD OUTPUT STACKS ON---------- A LEVEL SOMEWHAT ABOVE THAT OF THE STAGE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SYSTEM---------- IS USED FREQUENTLY TO SIMULATE MOVEMENT.-------------- THIS APPLIES MORE ESPECIALLY TO THE STACK BEHIND THE STAGE, OF COURSE,---------- WHICH IN MOST CASES WOULD BE DROWNED BY THE MORE POWERFUL INDEPENDENT---------- STEREO STAGE PA. THE STAGE QUAD-STACK ALSO-SERVES AS AN-AURAL CUE TO---------- THE BAND, WHO-MIGHT OTHERWISE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE OTHER QUAD---------- CHANNELS, WHICH COULD LITERALLY BE HUNDREDS-OF FEET AWAY FROM THE STAGE.----------------------------- ANY ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE QUAD PICTURE FROM THE RECORDED VERSION---------- WOULD BE DISASTROUS. THE DELAY FROM FRONT TO BACK IN A LARGE HALL COULD---------- BE AS MUCH AS HALF A SECOND, AND IN TIGHT RHYTHMIC SECTIONS THIS WOULD---------- BE VERY UNPLEASANT TO LISTEN TO, QUITE APART FROM THE BAND FINDING---------- TIMEKEEPING VERY DIFFICULT WITH THEIR OWN SOUND COMING BACK AT THEM---------- FROM AL DIRECTIONS WITH VARIOUS ERRATIC DEGREES OF DELAY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THUS,---------- THE QUAD SYSTEM FOR A LIVE HALL HAS TO BE USED IN A RATHER SUBTLE MANNER,---------- THE AIM BEING IN THIS CASE TO ADD IMPACT AT RELEVANT POINTS IN THE---------- PIECE BEING PERFORMED. IN THE LONG INTRODUCTION TO--- DARK SIDE----,---------- THE HEART BEAT FADES ON SLOWLY AS THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM AND SYNTHESIZERS---------- AND VOICES SWIRL AROUND THE HALL. IN ONE OF THE FLOYD'-----S OLD FAVORITES---------- THE EFFECT IS SLIGHTLY LESS SUBTLE: IN--- CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE EUGENE---- THE---------- QUAD CARRIES NO SOUND AT ALL UNTIL THE FAMOUS HORRIFIC SCREAM AT WHICH---------- EVERY AMPLIFIER AND SPEAKER IS DRIVEN TO ITS ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM, ACCOMPANIED---------- BY AN EXPLOSION OF FLASH POWDER BEHIND THE STAGE.----------------------------- ANY INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT CARRYING A MICROPHONE TO THE MIXING CONSOLE---------- CAN BE INDIVIDUALLY SWITCHED INTO THE QUAD SYSTEM. THIS IS USED TO---------- THE MOST ADVANTAGE ON QUIET PASSAGES WHERE THE MAIN STEREO PA CAN BE---------- VIRTUALLY SHUT DOWN AND THE MAXIMUM USE MADE OF QUAD PAN POTS FOR MOVEMENT.----------------------------- WITH DOMESTIC QUADRAPHONIC SYSTEMS, SEATING POSITION IS-VERY IMPORTANT.---------- IN A CONCERT-HALL, HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT AS CRITICAL OWING TO THE GREATER---------- DISTANCES-INVOLVED BETWEEN CHANNELS. IT IS AN-UNFORTUNATE FACT, HOWEVER,---------- THAT SOME UNLUCKY CONCERT GOERS HAVE TO SIT DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH A QUAD---------- STACK AND GET THEMSELVES DEAFENED----- - WHICH IS AS GOOD A REASON---------- AS ANY FOR NOT USING THE QUAD TOO MUCH THROUGHOUT THE CONCERT. IN THE---------- FILM EARTHQUAKE THE NOISE ISSUES FROM HUGE CABINETS AT BOTH ENDS OF---------- THE THEATER, AND THE AUTHOR WAS UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND HIMSELF SITTING---------- NEAR ONE OF THE REAR STACKS AT A SHOWING IN THE WEST END.------------------------------ PINK FLOYD-HAVE RECENTLY USED BACK PROJECTED FILM BEHIND THE STAGE---------- WITH A 35 MM FOUR CHANNEL SOUND TRACK. THIS HAS PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL---------- BUT PROBLEMS DO ARISE WITH RUN-UP-TIMES OF UP TO TEN SECONDS WHEN ATTEMPTING---------- TO BRING IN A SOUND ON A MUSICAL CUE. FILM AND MULTICHANNEL SOUND ARE---------- NOW COMMONPLACE OF COURSE, AS IN THE NEW KEN RUSSELL PICTURE OF--- TOMMY---- AND---------- ITS USE OF A----- `QUINTOPHONIC'----- SYSTEM----- - DOUBTLESS AN----------- INDICATION OF-THINGS TO COME.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ****************************-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SURROUND----- SOUND AT THE STEREO SOCIETY:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TO----- SURROUND SOUND, AN INTRODUCTION (2001)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BY MIKE THORNE.--------- WHERE ARE WE NOW?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TO QUADRAPHONICS----- AND MUSIC (1974)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  BY MIKE THORNE.--------- ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN---- HI-FI NEWS AND RECORD REVIEW ANNUAL,----- UK,------------------------------ 1974 ABOUT THE MUSICAL----- POSSIBILITIES OF QUADRAPHONIC SURROUND SOUND, AND SOME SPECULATION ABOUT---- POTENTIAL- FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS-------.-THE IDEAS STILL APPLY IN TODAY'S 5.----1 SURROUND- SOUND ENVIRONMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TO RECORDING------------- GURRELIEDER----- (1975)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BY PAUL MYERS (DIRECTOR, CBS INTERNATIONAL -----MASTERWORK) AND BOB AUGER (BOB AUGER ASSOCIATES).--------- ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN STUDIO SOUND, UK, JUNE-------------- IN FALL 1974, IN ONE-OF THE MOST COMPLEX SESSIONS LONDON HAS SEEN,---- GURRELIEDER-------- WAS RECORDED BY CBS FOR STEREO AND EVENTUAL QUADRAPHONIC RELEASE.
