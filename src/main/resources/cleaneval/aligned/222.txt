STARS IN YOUR EYES---! ASTROLOGICAL FORECASTS FOR UNCOMMON WOMYN AND OTHERS-----BY CHAD HENRY, AFA, NCGR------------------------------------------------------------------------- MARCH ASTROLOGICAL FORECAST------- DO YOU KNOW-YOUR MOON SIGN?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOST OF US KNOW OUR SUN SIGNS�"LIBRA, ARIES, SAGITTARIUS, PISCES, AND SO ON THROUGH------- THE ZODIAC. BUT HOW MANY OF US KNOW WHAT SIGN THE MOON WAS IN AT THE MOMENT OF OUR -------BIRTH? THOUGH PEOPLE OF ALL SEXES-HAVE AN ASTROLOGICAL MOON, WOMEN HAVE A SPECIAL------- AFFINITY FOR THIS MYSTERIOUS LADY OF THE NIGHTX"NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND IN THE------- BUTCH-FEMME LINE-UP. LUNA RULES WOMEN, MOMS, THE-PUBLIC, THE TIDES, THE MENSTRUAL------- CYCLE, THE MOODS AND EMOTIONS. SHE IS INTUITIVE AND PSYCHIC. SHE SYMBOLIZES THE GREAT------- GODDESS IN ALL HER PHASES, FROM MAIDEN TO WARRIOR TO MOTHER TO CRONE. PLANTING BY MOON------- SIGN IMPROVES GARDEN PRODUCTION, AND PLANNING BY MOON SIGN CAN IMPROVE EVERY PHASE OF------- YOUR LIFE. THE MOON RULES HOME, FAMILY, MOTHERHOOD, AND-CHILDBIRTH. WHEREAS THE PLANET------- MERCURY RULES THE ANALYTICAL, INTELLECTUAL BRAIN, THE MOON RULES THE ENTIRE MIND, WHICH------- RECEIVES KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM DIRECTLY FROM THE UNIVERSE, THE SUBCONSCIOUS, AND THE------- COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS. SHE ALSO RULES HABITS AND UNCONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGEX"LIKE------- KNOWING HOW TO TIE YOUR SHOES, DRIVE A CAR, CRUISE A CUTIE WITHOUT GETTING BUSTED.---------------------- THE MOON GIVES FORM TO YOUR SUN SIGN, THE WAY A MOTHER GIVES FORM TO THE SPARK THAT------- BECOMES HER CHILD. YOU MAY HAVE A RAMBUNCTIOUS ARIES SUN, BUT WITH A LIBRA MOON,------- YOUXLL WARM UP THAT DRIVE AND ASSERTIVENESS WITH DIPLOMACY, TACT, CONSIDERATION AND------- UNCERTAINTY. WITH A LEO MOON, YOU’RE XENA II! THERE ARE 144 SUN-MOON------- COMBINATIONSX"WHATXS YOURS? YOUR LUNAR PHASE AT BIRTH WILL TELL AN ASTROLOGER A LOT------- ABOUT YOUR MISSION IN LIFE, AND THE LUNAR NODESX"A LOT MORE, EVEN, ACCORDING TO INDIAN------- ASTROLOGERS, YOUR TRUE LIFE PATH.---------------------- ALTHOUGH WOMEN AS A RULE SEEM MUCH MORE IN TOUCH WITH LUNAR ENERGY THAN MEN DO, STILL,------- WESTERN CIVILIZATION KEEPS TRYING TO STEER US AWAY FROM THE IRRATIONAL, ILLOGICAL, DEEP------- AND ANCIENT WISDOM OF LUNAR ENERGY, AND TOWARD RATIONALITY, LOGIC, "COMMON SENSE-,------- CLOCK TIME, SCHEDULES, FACTS AND FIGURES. IN FACT, DON MIGUEL RUIZ, AUTHOR OF THE HIGHLY------- RECOMMENDED "THE FOUR AGREEMENTS", CALLS MODERN URBAN HUMANS "DOMESTICATED".------- WHICH MEANS TAMED, INTIMIDATED, DUMBED DOWN, UPTIGHT, CUT OFF FROM OUR INSTINCTUAL,------- LUNAR SELVES. TO BE TRULY JOYFUL AND CONNECTED, WE NEED THE FREEDOM TO HONOR OUR------- INSTINCTIVE, LUNAR IDENTITY, WHICH IN FACT IS A BIG PART OF OUR OVERALL PERSONALITY-------! LEARNING YOUR MOON SIGN, NATAL LUNAR PHASE, AND SIGN AND HOUSE PLACEMENT OF YOUR------- LUNAR NODES, IS A FIRST STEP TOWARD BETTER SELF-UNDERSTANDING.---------------------- FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE PATHS OF WICCA, TIBETAN BUDDHISM, AND SO MANY OTHER------- SPIRITUAL PRACTICES, FOLLOWING THE PHASES OF THE MOON, AND CELEBRATING THE NEW AND FULL------- MOONS EVERY MONTH, ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF WORSHIP. HONORING THE NEW AND FULL MOONS------- MONTHLY, EVEN WITH A SINGLE WHITE CANDLE, CAN HELP TO RECONNECT YOU WHEN YOUXRE------- FEELING LONELY, CUT OFF, DEPRESSED, FLAT AND DULL, OR TRAPPED IN A BORING JOB, A------- FRUSTRATING RELATIONSHIP, AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESNXT BRING YOU HAPPINESS. IF YOU------- DONXT HAVE ONE, FIND A PICTURE THAT YOU LOVE OF ANY ONE OF THE GREAT GODDESSES OF------- ANY WORLD RELIGION, FROM VIRGIN MARY TO KALI TO KWAN YINX"OR EVEN MIX AND------- MATCH!X"MAKE A TINY LITTLE SHRINE TO THE GODDESS ON YOUR BOOKSHELF OR WINDOW SILL, AND------- START WATCHING THE MOON PHASESX"WITH A CALENDAR, THE NEWSPAPER, OR ONE OF THE MANY------- ONLINE RESOURCES THAT TRACK THE PHASES, SUCH AS LUNABAR.COM. LIGHT THAT CANDLE TWICE A------- MONTH ON THE NEW AND FULL MOONS, LIGHT SOME GREAT INCENSE, RING A BELL, GIVE HER A------- BROWNIE OR A GLASS OF VODKA, AND ASK HER FOR GUIDANCE, WISDOM, LOVE, HEALTH, AND LUCK.------- CONNECT WITH HER DURING YOUR PERIOD, TOO. CHANTING, DRUMMING, DANCING, SINGING, PLAYING------- MUSIC, MAKING FREEFORM ARTWORK, PLAYING GAMES, MEDITATING, CASTING SPELLS, WORKING------- WITH TAROT, I CHING OR RUNES OR OTHER NON-LINEAR SPIRIT WORK CAN HELP FORGE A LINK BACK------- TO YOUR LUNAR SELF, AND BACK TO WHOLENESS AND HAPPINESS.---------------------- THE NEW MOON IN MARCH IS THE 14THX"THE FULL-MOON IS ON-THE 28TH.

THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT, FREE------- TO COME AND GO AT WILL, AND THEY WANT TO DO THINGS THEIR OWN WAY. THEY LIKE SPEED AND------- EFFICIENCY. THEIR LEADERSHIP STYLE IS "YOU CAN FOLLOW ME OR NOT-BUT IXM GONNA BE OUT------- THERE IN FRONT!" A LOT OF FOLKS WITH ARIES MOON WILL TELL YOU THEY HAD HORRIBLE FIGHTS AT------- HOME, ESPECIALLY WITH DAD. THEY TEND TO DRIVE TOO FAST, EVEN THOUGH THEIR SKILLS AND------- COORDINATION ARE USUALLY EXCELLENT.
