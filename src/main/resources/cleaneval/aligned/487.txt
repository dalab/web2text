New, radical proposals for constitutional reform□□□□□□□□□Lack of clear blue water between the two main parties threatened to
squeeze the Liberal Democrats but - despite a lower vote than in 1992
- they won over twice as many seats due to careful targeting of their
limited resources and skilful tactical voting by anti-Conservative
voters.□□□□□□□□□□□□What about 2001 ?□□□□□□□□□□□□□From the above, it is safe to conclude that Labour will win the next
election. It is a safe betor is it ?□□□□□□□□One of the main things that came out of the 1997 election was voter
volatility. If it happened in 1997, then it could happen in 2001. The
number of people who changed support from the 1992 election to the
1997 election has been as high as 23% by NOP. This is an increase of
2% from the 1987 election. If this trend is continued, as many as 25%
may change their voting allegiance in 2001.□□□□□□□□In 1997, Labour had very strong representation amongst the 18 to 29
years old age group. If this group feels significantly let down by the
last 5 years of Labour government, it could turn against Blair. In the
5 years from 1992 to 1995, the Tories lost 18% support among this
group while Labour won 19% from this group.□□□□□□□□The evidence tends to suggest that the Tories suffered the most from
tactical voting□□□□□□□□The Tories suffered in 1997 from the electoral system. If the Tories
had got the number of seats that their percentage of votes in each
constituency represented, then the overall Labour majority would have
been cut to 131 - still very large from a Parliamentary perspective.
Likewise, the LibDems success would have been cut to 28 seats rather
than 46. But the support for the Tories is concentrated primarily in
the south, whereas support for the Labour Party has expanded away from
the traditional areas associated with the Labour Party. But expansion
can always lead to contraction and tactical voting in 1997 might not
