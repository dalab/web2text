ONLY A FEW STANDING LIGHTS WERE STILL BURNING AND------------ THE DOOR TO THE BEDROOM WAS SECURELY SHUT.-SUDDENLY HIS EYES POPPED OPEN AND HE GOT TO HIS------------ FEET. A MOMENT LATER THE LIFT-DOOR OPENED FOR QUI-GON, STILL-ACCOMPANIED BY OBI-WAN AND------------ JACEN.------------------------------------------------------------------ "CAPTAIN TYPHO HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH MEN------------ DOWNSTAIRS.-----" OBI-WAN WAS SAYING.----- "NO ASSASSIN-WILL TRY THAT WAY.------------------------------------------------------------------" THE MASTER NODDED, FACE CLOSED EYES DISTANT. HIS PAST-AND------------ PRESENT PADAWANS LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN AT EACH OTHER, THEY KNEW THAT-LOOK.------------------------------------------------------------------ "MASTER?-----" ANAKIN PRODDED.------------------------------------------------------------- QUI-GON BLINKED, FOCUSED ON HIM, SMILED.----- "ANYTHING TO------------ REPORT?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "QUIET AS A TOMB. THE GIRLS WENT TO BED AN HOUR OR SO------------ AGO.-----" ANAKIN GLANCED UNEASILY AROUND THE LUXURIOUS ROOM.----- "I DON'T LIKE JUST------------ WAITING HERE FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO HER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "DON'T ANTICIPATE, ANAKIN, FOCUS ON THE MOMENT.-----------------" THE MASTER SAT DOWN ON ONE OF THE COUCHES.----- "WE MUST BE PATIENT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "I'M SORRY, MASTER,-----" ANAKIN SHRUGGED AT LITTLE.----------------- "I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AT PATIENCE.------------------------------------------------------------------" AN AMUSED GLANCE FROM THE MASTER.----- "I KNOW.------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN PICKED UP THE SMALL SECURITY MONITOR LYING-ON A------------ TABLE, FROWNED AT THE BLANK SCREEN.----------" "WHAT'S THIS?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "SHE WOULDN'T LET ME PUT ANY CAMERAS IN HER ROOM.-------------------ANAKIN EXPLAINED, ADDING APOLOGETICALLY.-------I DON'T THINK SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF ME------------ WATCHING HER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "WHAT IS SHE THINKING?-----" OBI-WAN LOOKED-TOWARDS THE------------ BEDROOM DOOR AS IF TEMPTED TO SHAKE THE QUEEN AWAKE AND DEMAND AN EXPLANATION.------------------------------------------------------------------ "ARTOO IS IN THERE WITH HER,-----" ANAKIN ASSURED------------ QUI-GON,----- "SET ON SURVEILLANCE MODE.

I'M AWARE OF------------ EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THAT ROOM.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "IT'S TOO RISKY.-----" SAID OBI-WAN, ALSO TO QUI-GON,------------ THEN TO ANAKIN.----- "BESIDES, YOUR SENSES AREN'T THAT ATTUNED, YOUNG PADAWAN.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "AND YOURS ARE?-----" ANAKIN CHALLENGED, TEMPER FRAYING.------------------------------------------------------------------------- OBI-WAN'S LOOK WAS STERNLY QUELLING.----- "POSSIBLY.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "OBI-WAN IS OLDER AND MORE EXPERIENCED.-----" THE MASTER------------ CUT IN QUIETLY.----- "AND YOU ARE LETTING EMOTION CLOUD YOUR MIND, ANAKIN. LET GO OF FEAR------------ AND FEEL THE LIVING FORCE.------------------------------------------------------------------" HIS PADAWN BIT HIS LIP.----- "I'LL TRY, MASTER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY.-----" JACEN QUOTED IN A------------ RATHER GOOD IMITATION OF YODA'S VOICE. BOTH ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN GRINNED AND THE TENSION------------ BETWEEN THEM EASED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "STAY WITH US, OBI-WAN.-----" QUI-GON CONTINUED.----------------- "IT MAY BE WE'LL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM AS WELL AS OUR OWN TONIGHT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" HOURS PASSED. THE MASTER OCCUPIED ONE COUCH, RADIATING PEACE------------ AS HE MEDITATED, JACEN THE OTHER, OPENLY DOZING. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN STOOD NEAR THE BEDROOM------------ DOOR TALKING IN UNDERTONES.------------------------------------------------------------------ "MASTER RISKED HIS OWN FUTURE WITH THE ORDER TO SEE YOU------------ TRAINED,-----" OBI-WAN WAS SAYING WITH QUIET INTENSITY,----- "WILL YOU THROW THAT GIFT------------ BACK IN HIS FACE?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "OF COURSE NOT-----!" ANAKIN HISSED BACK.----- "I'D------------ NEVER DO THAT TO HIM.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "THEN *THINK--ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING, ANAKIN-----------------!" THE YOUNG MASTER RETORTED.----- "IF YOU CONTINUE TO FOLLOW YOUR IMPULSES YOU COULD HURT A------------ LOT OF PEOPLE,-----" NODDED TOWARDS THE BEDROOM,----- "INCLUDING HER-----!"

"I FEEL IT ALSO.------------------------------------------------------------------" SABRES DRAWN THEY SPRINTED INTO THE QUEEN'S BEDROOM------------------------------------------------------------- AMIDALA WOKE WITH A SHOCK. SHE HAD A SPLIT SECOND GLIMPSE OF------------ SEGMENTED, MULTI-LEGGED *SOMETHINGS--BEFORE THEY VANISHED IN A FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT. SAW------------ ANAKIN STANDING OVER HER ON THE BED, SABRE BLAZING IN HIS HAND, AND OBI-WAN GO THROUGH THE------------ WINDOW WITH A CRASH OF GLASS AND CLASH OF BLINDS.------------------------------------------------------------------ "IDIOT-----!" ANAKIN DOUSED HIS SABRE AND RAN OUT PAST-------------MASTER QUI-GON. THE OTHER PADAWAN STARTED TO FOLLOW BUT THE MASTER CALLED HIM BACK.----------------- "NO, JACEN, I NEED YOU HERE.------------------------------------------------------------------" EIRTAE AND RABE HURTLED INTO THE ROOM, FLINGING THEMSELVES------------ DOWN BESIDE HER.----- "YOUR HIGHNESS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?------------------------------------------------------------------" AMIDALA MANAGED A NOD, HER VOICE WASN'T WORKING YET.------------------------------------------------------------- TYPHO WAS RIGHT BEHIND THEM WITH A PAIR OF GUARDS.----- "WHAT------------ HAPPENED?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "THE QUEEN IS SAFE.-----" QUI-GON TOLD HIM BUT SHE------------ MUSN'T STAY HERE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "SHE CAN COME-DOWN TO MY-ROOMS.-----" JAMILLIA SPOKE------------ BREATHLESSLY FROM-THE DOORWAY, A ROBE CLUTCHED AROUND HER AND A HANDMAIDEN AT HER BACK.------------------------------------------------------------------ "AN EXCELLENT-IDEA, SENATOR. YOUR HIGHNESS?--------------------------------------------------------------------------YES, YES OF COURSE.-----" AMIDALA SAID SHAKILY. SHE GOT------------ OUT OF BED, RABE QUICKLY DRAPED A DRESSING GOWN OVER HER. SHE STARTED FOR THE DOOR,------------ EIRTAE'S ARM AROUND HER. PAUSED TO LOOK AT THE BROKEN WINDOW AND THEN AT THE MASTER.----------------- "OBI-WAN, ANAKIN...?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.-----" HE REASSURED HER. EYEBROWS------------ QUIRKED RUEFULLY.----- "I'M AFRAID BOTH MY PAST AND PRESENT PADAWANS ARE SOMEWHAT------------ RECKLESS.------------------------------------------------------------------" AMIDALA-SCRAPED UP A SMILE. ------I WONDER WHERE THEY COULD------------ HAVE LEARNED-IT FROM?-----" AND HIS EYES CRINKLED IN ANSWERING AMUSEMENT.------------------------------------------------------------------ "COME ON, AMMI,-----" JAMILLIA SAID TAKING-HER ARM,----------------- "IT'LL BE JUST LIKE AT SCHOOL. REMEMBER HOW-WE USED TO-SNEAK INTO EACH OTHERS ROOMS------------ AFTER HOURS?-----" THEY HEADED FOR THE LIFT, THE OTHER FOUR WOMEN CLUSTERED TIGHTLY AROUND------------ HER, AND NEARLY COLLIDED WITH JAR JAR FOLLOWED-BY A PAIR OF ARMED GUNGANS.------------------------------------------------------------------ "PADME! YOUSA NOT HURTIN?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "I'M FINE, GENERAL BINKS, DON'T WORRY.-----" THEN THEY------------ WERE IN THE LIFT, THE DOORS CLOSING BEHIND THEM, AS JAR JAR DEMANDED;----- "CAPTAIN TYPHO,------------ WHATSA GOIN' ON HERIN?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" PART VI--------------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN WOVE FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE NIGHTIME TRAFFIC HIGH------------ ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS OF CORUSCANT. FLASHES OF BLASTER FIRE SOME DISTANCE AWAY CAUGHT HIS------------ EYE.----- "THAT'S GOTTA BE HIM.-----" HE DECKED THE ACCELERATOR BUT BY THE TIME HE GOT TO-------------THE SCENE THERE WAS NO BLASTER FIRE, NO ASSASSIN DROID, JUST A SPREAD-EAGLED HUMAN BODY------------ FALLING TOWARDS THE BRIGHTLY LIGHTED CANYONS THOUSANDS OF FEET BELOW.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN DOVE STEEPLY, PULLED UP AND OBI-WAN LANDED ON THE------------ SPEEDER'S STERN AS NEATLY AS ONE COULD PLEASE. HE CLAMBERED BREATHLESSLY INTO THE------------ PASSENGER SEAT.------------------------------------------------------------------ "MASTER KENOBI, FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.-----" ANAKIN------------ GREETED MOCKINGLY------------------------------------------------------------------ "WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?-----" THE OTHER SNAPPED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "YOU KNOW ME, OBI-WAN, I HAD TO FIND A SPEEDER I REALLY------------ LIKED; MACH 10 ENGINES, OPEN COCKPIT, TOTALLY-COOL PAINT-JOB----------------------------------------------------------------------- -" "I AM UNDERWELMED BY YOUR WIT, PADAWAN.-----" THE------------ MASTER'S VOICE DRIPPED ICICLES,----- "WHERE'S JACEN?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "BACK WITH OUR-MASTER I GUESS, HE DIDN'T CATCH UP WITH ------------ME IN TIME.------ AS THEY SPOKE ANAKIN SPOTTED A SLEEK CLOSED SPEEDER LEAVING WITH------------ SUSPICIOUS SPEED AND GAVE CHASE.----- "THAT HIM?------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN'S FACE WENT BLANK A MOMENT AS HE SEARCHED THE FORCE.----------------- "YES-----------------------------------------------------------------------!" "RIIIGHT-----!" ANAKIN HIT THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN.------------------------------------------------------------- SENSING HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED THE ASSASSIN WOVE CONFUSINGLY------------ THROUGH TRAFFIC LANES, BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND THROUGH THE INTERLACED BEAMS OF A------------ HALF-FINISHED SKYSCRAPER.------------------------------------------------------------- OBI-WAN CLUNG WHITE KNUCKLED TO THE SIDE OF THE SPEEDER.-------------------CAREFUL! HEY, EASY-----------------------------------------------------------------------!" "SORRY,-MASTER, I FORGOT YOU DON'T LIKE FLYING.-----------------" THE SPEEDER DROPPED A FEW FEET,-JUST ENOUGH-TO MISS AN-ONCOMING TRANSPORT.------------------------------------------------------------------ "I DON'T LIKE FLYING-WITH *YOU*--------OBI-WAN RETORTED.------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN LOOKED OVER AT HIM.----- "OBI-WAN, YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN-------------FLYING SINCE BEFORE I COULD WALK I'M VERY GOOD----------------------------------------------------------------------- -" "WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING-----!" AN ONCOMING STREAM OF------------ PRIVATE SPEEDERS SPLIT TO AVOID THEM.--------------------------------------------------------------ANAKIN DROPPED OUT OF THE LANE.----- "SORRY ABOUT THAT.------------------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN CLOSED HIS EYES, INHALED A CALMING BREATH.----- "JUST------------ SLOW DOWN.-----" HE SAID IN CAREFULLY MEASURED TONES. OPENED HIS EYES, POINTED.----------------- "THERE! THERE HE GOES.------------------------------------------------------------------" THE ASSASSIN'S SPEEDER DUCKED BEHIND A-LINE OF FREIGHT------------ TRANSPORTS. ANAKIN WENT UNDER THEM, GAINING STEADILY AS THE TWO VEHICLED BANKED RIGHT------------ TURNS-AROUND TOWER SPIRES AND NEON BILLBOARDS. ATTEMPTING TO ELUDE HIS PURSUER THE------------ ASSASSIN DUCKED INTO A TRAM TUNNEL. ANAKIN PROMPTLY FOLLOWED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "WAIT! DON'T GO IN THERE-----!" OBI-WAN GASPED AS THE------------ TUNNEL CLOSED AROUND THEM.------------------------------------------------------------------ "DON'T WORRY, MASTER, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.-----------------" ANAKIN ASSURED HIM. THEY SKIMMED ROUND A BEND AND RIGHT INTO THEIR PREY, ACCELERATING------------ FRANTICALLY TOWARDS THEM WITH A TRAM FILLING THE TUNNEL BEHIND.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN FLIPPED THE SPEEDER UPSIDE DOWN IN A TIGHT LOOP-OVER------------ AND RACED OUT OF THE TUNNEL BARELY AHEAD OF SPEEDER AND COMMUTER TRAM.------------------------------------------------------------- BEYOND SPEECH OBI-WAN GAVE HIS COMPANION A WITHERING LOOK.------------------------------------------------------------------ "OKAY,-THAT WAS A-MISTAKE.------ ANAKIN CONCEEDED. THE-------------ASSASSIN'S-SPEEDER PULLED ALONG SIDE, A-BLASTER BARREL PROTRUDED FROM A SIDE WINDOW, ------------OBI-WAN DUCKED JUST IN TIME.------------------------------------------------------------------ "OOPS-----!" ANAKIN HIT THE BRAKES, DROPPING BEHIND AND------------ UNDER THEIR ATTACKER, SAFE FROM BLASTER FIRE. THE ASSASSIN DOVE STEEPLY DOWNWARD, SKIMMED------------ LOW OVER THE FLAT ROOFS OF A CONTINENT SIZED INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, FORCING ANAKIN TO FALL------------ BEHIND AGAIN.------------------------------------------------------------------ "RIGHT. THIS ISN'T WORKING.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "NO KIDDING.-----" OBI-WAN SAID ACIDLY. THEIR PREY------------ PULLED FURTHER AHEAD, SHOOTING THROUGH A QUASI-TUNNEL OF GIANT ENERGY COUPLINGS TOPPING A------------ POWER PLANT.----- "ANAKIN! DON'T GO THROUGH THERE------------------------------------------------------------------!" IGNORING HIM THE YOUNGER JEDI-ACCELERATED RIGHT AFTER THE------------ ASSASSIN, UNDER AND THROUGH THE GIGANTIC-ARCS OF BLUE LIGHTENING LEAPING-FROM COUPLING TO------------ COUPLING.------------------------------------------------------------------ "HOW MANY-TIMES HAVE-I TOLD YOU, STAY AWAY FROM POWER------------ COUPLINGS-----!" OBI-WAN COMPLAINED AS THEY SHOT FREE.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN GRINNED.----- "YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THAT------------ POWERFIELD TINGLE?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "NO ACTUALLY.-----" OBI-WAN SCANNED THE SKIES.----------------- "THERE HE GOES---------------------------------------------------------------------------THIS IS GETTING OLD.-------ANAKIN MUTTERED AS THEY------------ DARTED UPWARD IN PURSUIT.----- "WE GOTTA GET AHEAD OF HIM SOMEHOW.------------------------------------------------------------------" THE ASSASSIN'S SPEEDER VEERED SHARPLY, DIVING INTO A------------ BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED THROUGHWAY FOR AIR-TRAFFIC PIERCING A DENSE-RANGE OF MULTI-SPIRED------------ TOWERS. ANAKIN BANKED THE OTHER WAY LOOPING AROUND THE BUILDINGS.------------------------------------------------------------------ "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE GOING THE-WRONG WAY.--------------------------------------------------------------------ANI SHOOK HIS HEAD, EYES UNFOCUSED.----- "NO I'M NOT. THIS IS------------ A SHORTCUT.-----" BLINKED.----- "I THINK.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "YOU *THINK*?-----" OBI-WAN ECHOED, INCREDULOUSLY.------------------------------------------------------------- THEY HOVERED ABOVE THE STREAM OF TRAFFIC EMERGING FROM THE------------ THROUGHWAY FOR LONG SECONDS.------------------------------------------------------------- OBI-WAN, GRIMLY.----- "YOU'VE LOST HIM.------------------------------------------------------------------" ANAKIN, CALMLY.----- "NO I HAVEN'T.------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN BEGINING TO LOSE HIS TEMPER.----- "HE WENT COMPLETELY------------ THE OTHER WAY------------------------------------------------------------------!" ANAKIN, EVEN MORE CALMLY.----- "WE'LL SEE.------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN BREATHED, REGAINING HIS COMPOSURE.----- "ANAKIN,------------ WE'VE LOST HIM. WE SHOULD----------------------------------------------------------------------- -" "EXCUSE ME, MASTER.-----" ANAKIN SAID POLITELY AND------------ VAULTED OVER THE SIDE OF THE SPEEDER - FALLING SOME FIVE-STORIES TO LAND RIGHT ON TOP OF------------ THE ASSASSIN'S SPEEDER CRUISING-BENEATH THEM.------------------------------------------------------------- LOOKING AFTER HIM OBI-WAN SHOOK HIS HEAD, MUTTERED.----- "I------------ HATE IT WHEN HE DOES THAT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------" PART VII--------------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN CLAWED FOR A HANDHOLD ON THE SLEEK SURFACE OF THE------------ SPEEDER AS THE WIND TORE AT HIM.------------------------------------------------------------- *OKAY, MAYBE THIS WASN'T SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA.---------------------------------------------------------------HE WORKED HIS WAY PAINFULLY FORWARD TO THE TRANSPARENT------------ CANOPY, LOOKED IN. FOR AN INSTANT IT WAS A WOMAN'S FACE LOOKING BACK AT HIM WITH BIG DARK------------ EYES THEN ABRUPTLY, WITHOUT WARNING, IT SHIFTED TO SOMETHING GREY SKINNED AND QUITE------------ INHUMAN.------------------------------------------------------------- *A CHANGELING---------------------------------------------------------------!THE ASSASSIN, WHATEVER SHE OR IT WAS, BRAKED SUDDENLY AND------------ ANAKIN NEARLY WENT FLYING, BARELY CATCHING HIMSELF ON THE LEFT PRONG OF THE FORKED FRONT,------------ DANGLING BY HIS HANDS.------------------------------------------------------------- *CALM, REMEMBER CALM.------------------------------------------------------------------" HE MANAGED TO SWING OVER TO THE RIGHT PRONG AND THEN WORK HIS-------------WAY UP ON TOP AGAIN. THE ASSASSIN, BACK IN HUMAN FORM, GLARED AT HIM THROUGH THE CANOPY AS------------ HE IGNITED HIS SABRE TO CUT HIS WAY IN. GRABBED THE BLASTER LYING ON THE SEAT NEXT TO HER------------ AND FIRED UP AT HIM.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN JUST MANAGED TO BLOCK THE BOLT, NOT EASY AT SUCH CLOSE------------ QUARTERS, BUT THE IMPACT KNOCKED THE SABRE FROM HIS HAND.------------------------------------------------------------- *OH NO, NOT AGAIN---------------------------------------------------------------!HE SHOVED HIS HAND THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CANOPY, GRABBING------------ THE ASSASSIN'S WRIST AS SHE TRIED FOR A SECOND SHOT. IT WENT WILD, STRIKING THE CONTROL------------ BOARD AND THE SPEEDER BEGAN TO LOSE ALTITUDE, BUCKING WILDLY.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN HUNG ON AS THE ASSASSIN FOUGHT FOR CONTROL BUT THE------------ IMPACT AS-THEY HIT THE-PAVEMENT OF A PEDESTRIAN WAY SENT HIM FLYING INTO A ROW OF FUEL------------ DRUMS.------------------------------------------------------------- PICKING HIMSELF UP HE LOOKED AROUND. NOT ONE OF CORUSCANT'S------------ MORE SALUBRIOUS DISTRICTS, A-VARIGATED CROWD OF PANHANDLING UNDERSIDERS,-CRIMINALS,-------------CON-ARTISTS AND SLUMMING GLITTERATI WERE LIT BY GARISH NEON SIGNS AS THEY WANDERED ALONG------------ AN ESPLANADE OF GRITTY ENTERTAINMENT CLUBS. A FEW GLANCED AT ANAKIN BUT QUICKLY LOOKED------------ AWAY, NOT WANTING TO GET INVOLVED.------------------------------------------------------------- HE PUSHED THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE CRASHED SPEEDER, SAW THE------------ ASSASSIN CLIMB OUT AND GAVE CHASE, PUSHING AND SHOVING PEOPLE OUT OF HIS WAY. HIS QUARRY------------ DARTED THROUGH THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE CLUBS AND ANAKIN WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW WHEN A HAND------------ FELL ON HIS ARM STOPPING HIM IN HIS TRACKS. HE STARTED TO THROW IT OFF THEN REALIZED IT------------ WAS OBI-WAN.------------------------------------------------------------------ "SHE WENT IN THERE-----!" HE PANTED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "PATIENCE.-----" OBI-WAN ANSWERED, ANNOYINGLY UNRUFFLED.----------------- "USE THE FORCE, ANAKIN, THINK. HE WENT IN THERE TO HIDE, NOT RUN.------------------------------------------------------------------" AND EVEN MORE ANNOYINGLY RIGHT, AS USUAL.----- "YES,------------ OBI-WAN.------------------------------------------------------------------" THE OLDER JEDI OFFERED HIM HIS SABRE.----- "I BELIEVE THIS IS------------ YOURS?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "YEAH, THANKS.-----" ANAKIN TRIED TO TAKE IT BUT OBI-WAN------------ REFUSED TO LET GO OF HIS END. *UH-OH, STAND BY FOR LECTURE.--------------------------------------------------------------------"A JEDI'S SABRE IS HIS MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION. HE MUST------------ KEEP IT WITH HIM AT ALL TIMES.-----" OBI-WAN SCOLDED, TRANSFIXING HIM WITH THOSE BLUE------------ EYES.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN RESTRAINED AN URGE TO ROLL HIS OWN.----- "YES,------------ MASTER.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "THIS WEAPON IS YOUR *LIFE*-----!" THE MASTER------------ EMPHASIZED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "I KNOW, I'M SORRY.-----" OBI-WAN DID HAVE A POINT AFTER------------ ALL.----- "IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "JEDI DON'T HAVE 'ACCIDENT', ANAKIN. YOU MUST BE MORE------------ FOCUSED.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "I KNOW, I KNOW. LOOK COULD WE HAVE THE REST OF THE------------ LESSON LATER, WE'VE GOT AN ASSASSIN TO CATCH.------------------------------------------------------------------" SHAKING HIS HEAD OBI-WAN LET GO OF HIS END OF THE LIGHTSABRE------------ AND LED THE WAY INTO THE CLUB.----- "HOW DOES OUR MASTER PUT UP WITH YOU?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "HE PRACTICED ON THE PADAWAN HE HAD BEFORE ME.-----------------" ANAKIN RETURNED SAUCILY.------------------------------------------------------------- HIS PREDECESSOR GRINNED WRYLY.----- "HE DID INDEED, POOR------------ MASTER, HE ALWAYS PICKS THE DIFFICULT ONES.------------------------------------------------------------------" ANAKIN NODDED AGREEMENT. STILL, IF HE COULD MANAGE TO TURN------------ OUT EVEN HALF AS WELL AS OBI-WAN HAD.....------------------------------------------------------------- IT SEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF SPORTS BAR. GIANT SCREENS LINED------------ THE WALLS SHOWING VARIOUS GAMES AND CONTESTS - INCLUDING POD-RACING! ANAKIN TORE HIS EYES------------ AWAY AND REMINDED HIMSELF TO FOCUS.------------------------------------------------------------------ "DO YOU SEE HIM?------------------------------------------------------------------" HE SCANNED THE CROWD WATCHING THE SCREENS, DRINKING, LAYING------------ BETS OR JUST TALKING SPORTS TALK.----- "NO. BUT OBI-WAN, I THINK HE'S A SHE AND THAT SHE'S------------ A CHANGELING.------------------------------------------------------------------" BLOND EYEBROWS LIFTED.----- "IN THAT CASE BE EXTRA------------ CAREFUL.-----" OBI-WAN NODDED TOWARDS THE CROWD.----- "GO AND FIND HER.------------------------------------------------------------------" ANAKIN BLINKED.----- "ME? WHAT ABOUT YOU?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "I,-----" OBI-WAN REPLIED COOLLY,----- "AM GOING TO GET------------ A DRINK.-----" QUIRKED AN EYEBROW AT HIM.----- "POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE.-----" AND WITH------------ THAT HE HEADED PURPOSEFULLY TOWARDS THE BAR LEAVING ANAKIN GAPING AFTER HIM.------------------------------------------------------------- *WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FOCUS?--HE WONDERED. THE CHASE MUST------------ HAVE BEEN HARDER ON OBI-WAN'S NERVES THAN HE, ANAKIN, HAD REALIZED. *I SHOULDN'T TEASE------------ HIM.--BUT FLYING WAS THE ONLY THING HE DID BETTER THAN OBI-WAN AND THE TEMPTATION TO SHOW------------ OFF WAS NEARLY IRRESISTABLE.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN CIRCLED THE ROOM, STUDYING THE POLYGLOT PATRONS GIVING------------ ESPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FEMALES, BOTH HUMAN AND ALIEN. AND THEY EYED HIM IN RETURN WITH------------ AN APPRECIATION AND INVITATION HE'D ONLY RECENTLY LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE.------------------------------------------------------------- *I WISH PADME WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.--SUDDENLY A------------ FAMILIAR HUM AND FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT SPUN HIM TOWARDS THE BAR. PUSHING HIS WAY AGAINST THE------------ BACKWASH OF PATRONS HE BROKE THROUGH INTO THE EMPTY SPACE THAT HAD FORMED AROUND OBI-WAN------------ STANDING,-SABRE IGNITED, OVER A GREY SUITED FIGURE CLUTCHING AT HER ARM.------------------------------------------------------------- *I SHOULDA KNOWN.--ANAKIN ADDED ALOUD.----- "I CAN'T TAKE YOU------------ ANYWHERE, CAN I?------------------------------------------------------------------" OBI-WAN JUST FLICKED HIM A GLANCE, EXTINGUISHED HIS SABRE AND------------ REACHED DOWN TO PULL THE ASSASSIN-TO HER FEET.------------------------------------------------------------------ "JEDI BUSINESS.-----" ANAKIN ANNOUNCED TO THE STARING------------ CROWD.----- "GO BACK TO YOUR DRINKS.-----" AND THE PATRONS TURNED UNEASILY AWAY, SELF------------ CONSCIOUSLY RESUMING THEIR ACTIVITIES AS THE TWO JEDI HALF CARRIED THEIR PRISONER OUT A------------ SIDE DOOR INTO A NOISOME ALLEY.------------------------------------------------------------------ "DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL?-----" OBI-WAN------------ ASKED, ALMOST CONVERSATIONALLY, AS HE EXAMINED THE DAMAGED ARM.------------------------------------------------------------------ "THE SENATOR FROM NABOO.-----" THE WOMAN MUMBLED.------------------------------------------------------------------ "WHO HIRED YOU?-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "IT WAS JUST A JOB.-----" SHE EVADED.------------------------------------------------------------- ANAKIN WASN'T HAVING ANY OF THAT.----- "WHO HIRED YOU?-----------------" HE REPEATED, ADDED WITH A TOUCH OF FORCE BEHIND HIS VOICE.----- "TELL US-----------------------------------------------------------------------!" "IT WAS A BOUNTY HUNTER,-----" SHE MUTTERED UNWILLINGLY,----------------- "CALLED----- -" BROKE OFF WITH A LITTLE GASP. HER EYES GLAZED, THEN CLOSED, AND AS------------ OBI-WAN LOWERED HER TO THE GROUND SHE CHANGED, BECOMING THE WRINKLED GREY NON-HUMAN ANAKIN------------ HAD GLIMPSED IN THE SPEEDER.------------------------------------------------------------- INSTINCTIVELY THE TWO JEDI GLANCED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS, JUST-------------IN TIME TO SEE AN ARMOURED FORM ROCKET AWAY FROM A NEARBY ROOFTOP. -------------------------------------------------------------THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEN OBI-WAN FELT AT THE DEAD------------ ALIEN'S NECK, EXTRACTING A WICKED LOOKING MULTI-TIPPED DART.----- "A TOXIC DART.-----------------------------------------------------------------------" "WELL IT'S A CLUE ANYWAY.-----" SAID ANAKIN.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
