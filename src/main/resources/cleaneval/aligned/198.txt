conditions.□□□□□□This was probably a result of the recent vent, combined with the fact
that we□□□□□□were running non-standard shapes, and thus putting power on different
vessel□□□□□□surfaces.  This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a
high□□□□□□hydrogen fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption;
H/D□□□□□□typically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing.□□□□□□□□□□□□□The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and we□□□□□□did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade shapes
(see□□□□□□physics operator summary for details of changes made). □These had elongation□□□□□□close to our vertical stability limits (k~1.73), and were close to
double null,□□□□□□which may have caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and
possibly□□□□□□
also increased H-mode thresholds.  The last AUG shaped shot,
1010719020, is a□□□□□□good example  (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47)□□□□□□□□□□□□□J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with
typically 2.3□□□□□□MW at 80 MHz from D and E port antennas.  However, the low absorption
means□□□□□□that the effective power was actually much lower, especially late in
the pulse.□□□□□□We were unable to get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character.
□Many were□□□□□□ELM-free, with strongly increasing impurities.  (eg. shot 2, 14).

Others, with□□□□□□lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour typical of
Type III□□□□□□ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots 5,13).  On shots 9 and 11
we ramped□□□□□□the RF up slowly to get threshold data, and found it was over the 2.3
MW□□□□□□injected); this is very high for these C-Mod conditions.  Making the
discharge□□□□□□more 'single null' had little effect (shot 12).  Lowering the target
density□□□□□□from nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar at
the RF□□□□□□onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in much lower neutral
pressure□□□□□□anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot 13).  This may be a good point for
threshold□□□□□□comparison, though it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full
RF power□□□□□□at this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes.□□□□□□□□□□□□□In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from 1.0 to
0.9 MA from□□□□□□shot 15 on.  This raised q95 to 4.2.  The rates of density rise did
decrease□□□□□□slightly, though not an obvious EDA regime.  Shot 16 had hints of a
weak□□□□□□quasi-coherent□□□□□□mode on PCI.  Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy.  From shot 19 Bt was
raised□□□□□□from 5.3 T to 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a better match to
the AUG□□□□□□target.□ This proved more difficult for the RF to match, for reasons
not well□□□□□□understood at least by me, and power was not as steady as the rest of
the day.□□□□□□The density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes
characteristic□□□□□□of EDA were seen on PCI.  Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a good
time for□□□□□□pedestal analysis.  For shot 22, we went back to a standard shape, 800
kA shot□□□□□□to check we could get EDA there.  We did, but it quickly cooled and
reverted to□□□□□□Type III ELMs as H/D rose.□□□□□□□□□□□□□In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady H-modes
in the□□□□□□lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape.  However, the poor machine
conditions□□□□□□and low absorbed power undoubtedly were a major impediment, and there
were□□□□□□indications we were getting close.  There was insufficient power to try
raising□□□□□□the density.  Since the discharge development has been successfully
completed,□□□□□□we would very much like to revisit this experiment on a day with
better vessel□□□□□□conditions and all three RF antennas available.□□□□□□□□□□□□□Shot Details:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□------□□□□□□□□1010719001	hubbard	SESSION_LEADER	Jul 19 2001□ 8:54:52:166AM□□□□□□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□.□□□□□□First shot had 5.6 T, 2 MW RF with several trips. □3 H-modes, very ELM-free.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□------□□□□□□□□1010719002	hubbard	SESSION_LEADER	Jul 19 2001□ 9:13:07:103AM□□□□□□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□. □□.□□□□□□Bt= 5.35 T, 2 MW RF. □3 H-modes, very ELM-free.□ 3 H-modes, ended by big□□□□□□injections.□□□□□□□□□□□□□Disrupts 1.3 secs.□□□□□□□□□□□□□H/D getting to 10%, and second half of flat-top is L-mode, indicating

A comparison plot is in
□□□□□□user10:[hutch.ps]aug_match.ps. They are close to double null;□□□□□□although a range of three sseps was run without obvious effect on the□□□□□□plasma character. No solid EDA H-modes were obtained. The H/D was high□□□□□□and rose strongly with RF in the early part of the day. Later on, the□□□□□□rises seemed less significant, but in all cases the H/D was above 10%□□□□□□during much of the RF pulse. Heating was clearly inefficient in many□□□□□□cases. In some others heating was ok even at high H/D.□□□□□□□□□□□□The early part of the day was plagued with injections. Many appeared□□□□□□to be caused by visible sparks on the upper left corner of D-antenna.□□□□□□Some others were not RF induced. As the day wore on, these problems
□□□□□□were less severe, and the plasma ran reasonably reliably.□□□□□□□□□□□□These shapes are fairly close to stability limits. One or two VDEs
were□□□□□□experienced. The chopper V was set to 150 to 200 instead of the usual
0□□□□□□to lower the operating average current to a position closer to the
center□□□□□□of its range. This adjustment seemed to be a significant improvement
in
□□□□□□that it allowed operation with an elongation that gave rise to noisy
chopper□□□□□□behaviour without leading to saturations and subsequent VDE.□□□□□□□□□□□□A manual gas puff during the RF did not significantly improve the
□□□□□□operation, but also did not seem to give much impact on the RF
coupling□□□□□□despite a x2 rise in main chamber neutral pressure.□□□□□□□□□□□□It appears to be confirmed that the lower triangularity that is needed
to□□□□□□match AUG makes it harder to get into EDA. The high H level was also
□□□□□□definitely a handicap.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Scorecard.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
