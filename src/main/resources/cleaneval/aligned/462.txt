------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TRAN----I---------FSTH---------------- THE GNU MANIFESTO----------------- THE GNU MANIFESTO (WHICH APPEARS BELOW) WAS WRITTEN BY---------------------------------------- RICHARD STALLMAN---- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GNU PROJECT, TO ASK FOR----- PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORT . FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS, IT WAS----- UPDATED IN MINOR WAYS TO ACCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENTS, BUT NOW IT----- SEEMS BEST TO LEAVE IT UNCHANGED-AS MOST PEOPLE-HAVE SEEN IT.------ SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT CERTAIN COMMON----- MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT DIFFERENT WORDING COULD HELP AVOID.----- FOOTNOTES ADDED IN------HELP CLARIFY THESE POINTS.------ FOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AVAILABLE GNU SOFTWARE,----- PLEASE SEE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON----- OUR--------------------- WEB SERVER----, IN PARTICULAR----- OUR---------------------------------- LIST OF SOFTWARE----.- FOR----- HOW TO CONTRIBUTE, SEE---------------------------------- HTTP://WWW.GNU.ORG/HELP----.------------ WHAT'S GNU?- GNU'S NOT UNIX--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!  GNU, WHICH STANDS FOR GNU'S NOT UNIX, IS THE NAME FOR THE COMPLETE-UNIX-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE SYSTEM WHICH I AM WRITING SO THAT I CAN GIVE-IT AWAY-FREE TO EVERYONE WHO CAN USE IT.------------------------------------------- (1)---- SEVERAL OTHER VOLUNTEERS ARE HELPING ME.-CONTRIBUTIONS OF TIME, MONEY, PROGRAMS AND EQUIPMENT ARE GREATLY-NEEDED.------------ SO FAR WE HAVE AN EMACS TEXT EDITOR WITH LISP FOR WRITING EDITOR-COMMANDS, A SOURCE LEVEL DEBUGGER, A YACC-COMPATIBLE PARSER GENERATOR,-A LINKER, AND AROUND 35 UTILITIES.- A SHELL (COMMAND INTERPRETER) IS-NEARLY COMPLETED.- A NEW PORTABLE OPTIMIZING C COMPILER HAS COMPILED-ITSELF AND MAY BE RELEASED THIS YEAR.- AN INITIAL KERNEL EXISTS BUT-MANY MORE FEATURES ARE NEEDED TO EMULATE UNIX.- WHEN THE KERNEL AND-COMPILER ARE FINISHED, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE A-GNU SYSTEM-SUITABLE FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.- WE WILL USE TEX AS OUR TEXT-FORMATTER, BUT AN NROFF IS BEING WORKED ON.- WE WILL USE THE FREE,-PORTABLE X WINDOW SYSTEM AS WELL.- AFTER THIS WE WILL ADD A PORTABLE-COMMON LISP, AN EMPIRE GAME, A SPREADSHEET, AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER-THINGS, PLUS ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION.- WE HOPE TO SUPPLY, EVENTUALLY,-EVERYTHING USEFUL THAT NORMALLY COMES WITH A UNIX SYSTEM, AND MORE.------------ GNU WILL BE ABLE TO RUN UNIX PROGRAMS, BUT-WILL NOT BE IDENTICAL TO-UNIX.- WE WILL MAKE ALL IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE CONVENIENT, BASED ON OUR-EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS.- IN PARTICULAR, WE PLAN TO-HAVE LONGER FILE NAMES, FILE VERSION NUMBERS, A CRASHPROOF FILE SYSTEM,-FILE NAME COMPLETION PERHAPS, TERMINAL-INDEPENDENT DISPLAY SUPPORT, AND-PERHAPS EVENTUALLY A LISP-BASED WINDOW SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH SEVERAL-LISP PROGRAMS AND ORDINARY UNIX PROGRAMS CAN SHARE A SCREEN.- BOTH C-AND LISP WILL-BE AVAILABLE AS SYSTEM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.- WE WILL-TRY TO SUPPORT UUCP, MIT CHAOSNET, AND INTERNET PROTOCOLS FOR-COMMUNICATION.------------ GNU IS AIMED INITIALLY AT MACHINES-IN THE 680-0/16000 CLASS WITH-VIRTUAL MEMORY, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EASIEST MACHINES TO MAKE IT RUN-ON.- THE EXTRA EFFORT TO MAKE IT-RUN ON SMALLER MACHINES WILL BE LEFT-TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO USE IT ON THEM.------------ TO AVOID HORRIBLE CONFUSION, PLEASE PRONOUNCE THE `G'-IN THE WORD-`GNU' WHEN IT IS THE NAME OF-THIS PROJECT.--------- WHY I MUST WRITE GNU------------- I CONSIDER THAT THE GOLDEN RULE REQUIRES THAT IF I LIKE A PROGRAM I-MUST SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT.- SOFTWARE SELLERS WANT TO-DIVIDE THE USERS AND CONQUER THEM, MAKING EACH USER AGREE NOT TO SHARE-WITH OTHERS.- I REFUSE TO-BREAK SOLIDARITY WITH OTHER USERS IN THIS-WAY.- I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SIGN A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT OR A-SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT.- FOR YEARS I WORKED WITHIN THE ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE LAB TO RESIST SUCH TENDENCIES AND OTHER INHOSPITALITIES,-BUT-EVENTUALLY-THEY HAD GONE TOO FAR: I COULD NOT REMAIN IN AN-INSTITUTION WHERE SUCH THINGS ARE DONE FOR ME AGAINST MY WILL.------------ SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE TO USE COMPUTERS WITHOUT DISHONOR,-I HAVE-DECIDED TO PUT TOGETHER A SUFFICIENT BODY OF FREE-SOFTWARE SO THAT I-WILL BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITHOUT ANY SOFTWARE THAT IS NOT FREE.- I-HAVE RESIGNED FROM THE AI LAB TO DENY MIT ANY LEGAL EXCUSE TO PREVENT-ME FROM GIVING GNU AWAY.--------- WHY GNU WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH UNIX------------- UNIX IS NOT MY IDEAL SYSTEM, BUT IT IS NOT TOO BAD.- THE ESSENTIAL-FEATURES OF UNIX SEEM TO BE GOOD ONES, AND I THINK I CAN FILL IN WHAT-UNIX LACKS WITHOUT SPOILING THEM.- AND A SYSTEM COMPATIBLE WITH UNIX-WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE TO ADOPT.--------- HOW GNU WILL BE AVAILABLE------------- GNU IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.- EVERYONE WILL BE PERMITTED TO-MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE GNU, BUT NO DISTRIBUTOR WILL BE ALLOWED TO-RESTRICT ITS FURTHER-REDISTRIBUTION.- THAT IS TO SAY,-----------------------------------------------------------PROPRIETARY----- MODIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED.- I WANT TO-MAKE SURE THAT ALL VERSIONS OF GNU REMAIN FREE.--------- WHY MANY OTHER PROGRAMMERS WANT TO HELP------------- I HAVE FOUND MANY OTHER PROGRAMMERS WHO ARE EXCITED ABOUT GNU AND-WANT TO HELP.------------ MANY PROGRAMMERS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SYSTEM-SOFTWARE.- IT MAY ENABLE THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY, BUT IT REQUIRES THEM-TO FEEL IN CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROGRAMMERS IN GENERAL RATHER THAN FEEL-AS COMRADES.- THE FUNDAMENTAL ACT OF FRIENDSHIP AMONG PROGRAMMERS IS THE-SHARING OF PROGRAMS;-MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS-NOW TYPICALLY USED-ESSENTIALLY FORBID PROGRAMMERS TO TREAT OTHERS AS FRIENDS.- THE-PURCHASER OF SOFTWARE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND OBEYING THE-LAW.- NATURALLY, MANY DECIDE THAT FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT.- BUT-THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LAW OFTEN DO NOT FEEL AT EASE WITH EITHER CHOICE.-THEY BECOME CYNICAL AND THINK THAT PROGRAMMING IS JUST A WAY OF MAKING-MONEY.------------ BY WORKING ON AND USING GNU RATHER THAN PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, WE CAN-BE HOSPITABLE TO EVERYONE AND OBEY THE LAW.- IN ADDITION, GNU SERVES AS-AN EXAMPLE TO INSPIRE AND A BANNER TO RALLY OTHERS TO JOIN US IN-SHARING.- THIS CAN GIVE US A FEELING OF HARMONY WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE IF-WE USE SOFTWARE THAT IS NOT FREE.- FOR ABOUT HALF THE-PROGRAMMERS I-TALK TO, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT HAPPINESS THAT MONEY CANNOT REPLACE.--------- HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE----------------------- (NOWADAYS, FOR SOFTWARE TASKS TO WORK ON, SEE-----------------------------------------------------THE GNU TASK-LIST----.- FOR OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE,-SEE---------------------------------- HTTP://WWW.GNU.ORG/HELP----.)--------------------------- I AM ASKING COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS FOR DONATIONS OF MACHINES AND-MONEY.- I'M ASKING INDIVIDUALS FOR DONATIONS OF PROGRAMS AND WORK.-------------ONE CONSEQUENCE YOU CAN EXPECT IF YOU DONATE MACHINES IS THAT GNU-WILL RUN ON THEM AT AN EARLY DATE.- THE MACHINES SHOULD BE COMPLETE,-READY TO USE-SYSTEMS, APPROVED FOR USE IN A-RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND NOT-IN NEED OF SOPHISTICATED COOLING OR POWER.------------ I HAVE FOUND VERY MANY PROGRAMMERS EAGER TO CONTRIBUTE PART-TIME-WORK FOR GNU.- FOR MOST PROJECTS, SUCH PART-TIME DISTRIBUTED WORK WOULD-BE VERY HARD TO COORDINATE; THE INDEPENDENTLY-WRITTEN PARTS WOULD NOT-WORK TOGETHER.- BUT FOR THE PARTICULAR TASK OF REPLACING UNIX, THIS-PROBLEM IS ABSENT.- A COMPLETE UNIX SYSTEM CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF UTILITY-PROGRAMS, EACH-OF WHICH IS DOCUMENTED SEPARATELY.- MOST INTERFACE-SPECIFICATIONS ARE FIXED BY UNIX COMPATIBILITY.- IF EACH CONTRIBUTOR-CAN WRITE A COMPATIBLE REPLACEMENT FOR A SINGLE UNIX UTILITY, AND MAKE-IT WORK PROPERLY IN PLACE OF THE ORIGINAL ON A UNIX SYSTEM, THEN THESE-UTILITIES WILL WORK RIGHT WHEN PUT TOGETHER.- EVEN ALLOWING FOR MURPHY-TO CREATE A FEW UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS, ASSEMBLING THESE COMPONENTS WILL-BE A FEASIBLE TASK.- (THE KERNEL WILL REQUIRE CLOSER COMMUNICATION AND-WILL BE WORKED ON BY A SMALL, TIGHT GROUP.)------------ IF I GET DONATIONS OF MONEY, I MAY BE ABLE TO HIRE A FEW PEOPLE FULL-OR PART TIME.- THE SALARY WON'T BE HIGH BY PROGRAMMERS'-STANDARDS,-BUT-I'M LOOKING FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM BUILDING COMMUNITY-SPIRIT IS AS-IMPORTANT AS MAKING MONEY.- I VIEW THIS AS A WAY OF ENABLING DEDICATED-PEOPLE TO DEVOTE THEIR FULL ENERGIES TO WORKING ON GNU BY SPARING THEM-THE NEED TO MAKE A LIVING IN ANOTHER WAY.--------- WHY ALL COMPUTER USERS WILL BENEFIT------------- ONCE GNU IS WRITTEN, EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN GOOD SYSTEM-SOFTWARE FREE, JUST LIKE AIR.-------------------------------------------(2)---------------- THIS MEANS MUCH MORE THAN JUST SAVING EVERYONE THE-PRICE OF A-UNIX-LICENSE.- IT MEANS THAT MUCH WASTEFUL DUPLICATION OF SYSTEM PROGRAMMING-EFFORT WILL BE AVOIDED.- THIS EFFORT CAN GO INSTEAD INTO ADVANCING THE-STATE OF THE ART.------------ COMPLETE SYSTEM SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.--AS A RESULT,-A USER WHO NEEDS CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM WILL ALWAYS BE FREE TO MAKE THEM-HIMSELF, OR HIRE ANY AVAILABLE PROGRAMMER OR COMPANY TO MAKE THEM FOR-HIM.- USERS WILL NO LONGER BE AT THE MERCY OF ONE PROGRAMMER OR COMPANY-WHICH OWNS THE SOURCES AND IS IN SOLE POSITION TO MAKE CHANGES.------------ SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT-BY ENCOURAGING ALL STUDENTS TO STUDY AND IMPROVE THE-SYSTEM CODE.-HARVARD'S COMPUTER LAB USED TO-HAVE THE POLICY THAT NO PROGRAM COULD BE-INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM-IF ITS SOURCES WERE NOT ON PUBLIC DISPLAY,-AND-UPHELD IT BY ACTUALLY REFUSING TO INSTALL CERTAIN PROGRAMS.- I WAS VERY-MUCH INSPIRED BY THIS.------------ FINALLY, THE-OVERHEAD OF CONSIDERING WHO OWNS THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE-AND WHAT ONE IS OR IS-NOT ENTITLED TO DO WITH IT WILL BE LIFTED.------------ ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR USING A PROGRAM, INCLUDING-LICENSING OF COPIES, ALWAYS INCUR A TREMENDOUS COST TO SOCIETY THROUGH-THE CUMBERSOME MECHANISMS NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH (THAT IS,-WHICH PROGRAMS) A PERSON MUST PAY FOR.- AND ONLY A POLICE STATE CAN-FORCE EVERYONE TO OBEY THEM.- CONSIDER A SPACE STATION WHERE AIR MUST-BE MANUFACTURED AT GREAT COST: CHARGING EACH BREATHER PER LITER OF AIR-MAY BE FAIR, BUT WEARING THE METERED GAS MASK ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT IS-INTOLERABLE EVEN IF EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE AIR BILL.- AND THE-TV CAMERAS EVERYWHERE TO SEE IF YOU EVER TAKE THE MASK OFF ARE-OUTRAGEOUS.- IT'S BETTER TO SUPPORT THE AIR PLANT WITH A HEAD TAX AND-CHUCK THE MASKS.------------ COPYING ALL OR PARTS OF A PROGRAM IS AS NATURAL TO A PROGRAMMER AS-BREATHING, AND AS PRODUCTIVE.- IT OUGHT TO BE AS FREE.--------- SOME EASILY REBUTTED OBJECTIONS TO GNU'S GOALS------------------- "NOBODY WILL USE IT IF IT IS FREE, BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T----- RELY ON ANY SUPPORT.---------------------------" "YOU HAVE TO CHARGE FOR THE PROGRAM TO PAY FOR PROVIDING THE----- SUPPORT.---------------------" IF PEOPLE WOULD RATHER PAY FOR GNU PLUS SERVICE THAN GET GNU FREE-WITHOUT SERVICE, A COMPANY TO PROVIDE JUST SERVICE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE-OBTAINED GNU FREE OUGHT TO BE PROFITABLE.-------------------------------------------(3)---------------- WE MUST DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF REAL PROGRAMMING-WORK AND MERE HANDHOLDING.- THE FORMER IS SOMETHING ONE CANNOT RELY ON-FROM A SOFTWARE VENDOR.- IF YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT SHARED BY ENOUGH-PEOPLE, THE VENDOR WILL TELL YOU TO GET LOST.------------ IF YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON SUPPORT, THE ONLY WAY-IS TO HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY SOURCES AND TOOLS.- THEN YOU CAN HIRE ANY-AVAILABLE PERSON TO FIX YOUR PROBLEM; YOU ARE NOT AT THE MERCY OF ANY-INDIVIDUAL.- WITH UNIX, THE PRICE OF SOURCES PUTS THIS OUT OF-CONSIDERATION FOR MOST BUSINESSES.- WITH GNU THIS WILL BE EASY.- IT IS-STILL POSSIBLE-FOR THERE TO BE NO AVAILABLE COMPETENT PERSON, BUT THIS-PROBLEM CANNOT BE BLAMED-ON DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS.- GNU DOES NOT-ELIMINATE ALL THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS, ONLY SOME OF THEM.------------ MEANWHILE, THE USERS WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS NEED-HANDHOLDING: DOING THINGS FOR THEM WHICH THEY COULD EASILY DO-THEMSELVES BUT DON'T KNOW HOW.------------ SUCH SERVICES COULD BE PROVIDED BY COMPANIES THAT SELL JUST-HAND-HOLDING AND REPAIR SERVICE.- IF IT IS TRUE THAT USERS WOULD RATHER-SPEND MONEY AND GET A PRODUCT WITH SERVICE, THEY WILL ALSO BE WILLING-TO-BUY THE SERVICE HAVING GOT THE PRODUCT FREE.- THE SERVICE COMPANIES-WILL COMPETE IN QUALITY AND PRICE; USERS WILL NOT BE TIED TO ANY-PARTICULAR ONE.- MEANWHILE, THOSE OF-US WHO DON'T NEED THE SERVICE-SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE PROGRAM WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE SERVICE.------------------ "YOU CANNOT REACH MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT ADVERTISING, AND YOU MUST----- CHARGE FOR THE PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THAT.---------------------------" "IT'S NO USE ADVERTISING A PROGRAM PEOPLE CAN GET FREE.---------------------" THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF FREE OR VERY CHEAP PUBLICITY THAT CAN BE-USED TO INFORM NUMBERS OF COMPUTER USERS ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE GNU.- BUT-IT MAY BE TRUE THAT ONE CAN REACH MORE MICROCOMPUTER USERS WITH-ADVERTISING.- IF THIS IS REALLY SO, A BUSINESS WHICH ADVERTISES THE-SERVICE OF COPYING AND MAILING GNU FOR A FEE OUGHT TO BE SUCCESSFUL-ENOUGH TO PAY FOR ITS ADVERTISING AND MORE.- THIS WAY, ONLY THE USERS-WHO BENEFIT FROM THE ADVERTISING PAY FOR IT.------------ ON THE OTHER HAND, IF MANY PEOPLE GET GNU FROM THEIR FRIENDS, AND-SUCH COMPANIES DON'T SUCCEED, THIS WILL SHOW THAT ADVERTISING WAS NOT-REALLY NECESSARY TO SPREAD GNU.- WHY IS IT THAT FREE MARKET ADVOCATES-DON'T WANT TO LET THE FREE MARKET DECIDE THIS?-------------------------------------------(4)----------------------- "MY COMPANY NEEDS A PROPRIETARY OPERATING SYSTEM TO GET A----- COMPETITIVE EDGE.---------------------" GNU WILL REMOVE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FROM THE REALM OF-COMPETITION.- YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET AN EDGE IN THIS AREA, BUT-NEITHER WILL-YOUR COMPETITORS BE ABLE TO GET AN EDGE OVER YOU.- YOU AND-THEY WILL COMPETE IN OTHER AREAS, WHILE BENEFITING MUTUALLY IN THIS-ONE.- IF YOUR BUSINESS IS SELLING AN OPERATING SYSTEM, YOU WILL NOT-LIKE GNU, BUT THAT'S TOUGH ON YOU.- IF YOUR BUSINESS IS SOMETHING ELSE,-GNU CAN SAVE YOU FROM BEING PUSHED INTO THE EXPENSIVE BUSINESS-OF-SELLING OPERATING SYSTEMS.------------ I WOULD LIKE TO SEE GNU DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTED BY GIFTS FROM MANY-MANUFACTURERS AND USERS, REDUCING THE-COST TO EACH.-------------------------------------------(5)----------------------- "DON'T PROGRAMMERS DESERVE A REWARD FOR THEIR CREATIVITY?---------------------" IF ANYTHING-DESERVES A REWARD, IT IS SOCIAL-CONTRIBUTION.-CREATIVITY CAN BE A SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION, BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS SOCIETY-IS FREE TO USE THE RESULTS.- IF PROGRAMMERS DESERVE TO BE REWARDED FOR-CREATING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS, BY THE SAME TOKEN THEY DESERVE TO BE-PUNISHED IF THEY RESTRICT THE USE OF THESE PROGRAMS.------------------- "SHOULDN'T A PROGRAMMER BE ABLE TO ASK FOR A REWARD FOR HIS----- CREATIVITY?-----------------------THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING PAY FOR WORK, OR SEEKING TO-MAXIMIZE ONE'S INCOME, AS LONG AS ONE DOES NOT USE MEANS THAT ARE-DESTRUCTIVE.- BUT THE MEANS CUSTOMARY IN THE FIELD OF SOFTWARE TODAY-ARE-BASED ON DESTRUCTION.------------ EXTRACTING MONEY FROM USERS OF A PROGRAM BY RESTRICTING THEIR USE OF-IT IS DESTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THE RESTRICTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT AND THE-WAYS THAT THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED.- THIS REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF WEALTH-THAT HUMANITY DERIVES FROM THE PROGRAM.- WHEN THERE IS A DELIBERATE-CHOICE-TO RESTRICT, THE-HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES ARE DELIBERATE-DESTRUCTION.------------ THE REASON A GOOD CITIZEN DOES NOT USE SUCH DESTRUCTIVE MEANS TO-BECOME WEALTHIER IS THAT,-IF EVERYONE DID-SO, WE WOULD ALL BECOME-POORER FROM THE MUTUAL DESTRUCTIVENESS.- THIS IS KANTIAN ETHICS; OR,-THE GOLDEN RULE.- SINCE I DO-NOT LIKE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT RESULT IF-EVERYONE HOARDS INFORMATION, I AM REQUIRED TO CONSIDER IT WRONG FOR ONE-TO DO SO.- SPECIFICALLY, THE DESIRE TO BE REWARDED FOR ONE'S CREATIVITY-DOES NOT JUSTIFY DEPRIVING THE WORLD IN GENERAL OF ALL OR PART OF THAT-CREATIVITY.------------------- "WON'T PROGRAMMERS STARVE?---------------------" I COULD ANSWER THAT NOBODY-IS FORCED TO BE A PROGRAMMER.- MOST OF US-CANNOT MANAGE TO GET ANY MONEY FOR STANDING ON THE STREET AND MAKING-FACES.- BUT WE ARE NOT, AS A RESULT, CONDEMNED TO SPEND OUR LIVES-STANDING ON THE-STREET MAKING FACES, AND STARVING.- WE DO SOMETHING-ELSE.------------ BUT THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER BECAUSE IT ACCEPTS-THE QUESTIONER'S-IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION: THAT WITHOUT OWNERSHIP OF-SOFTWARE, PROGRAMMERS-CANNOT POSSIBLY BE PAID A CENT.- SUPPOSEDLY IT IS ALL OR NOTHING.------------ THE REAL REASON PROGRAMMERS WILL NOT STARVE IS THAT IT WILL STILL BE-POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET PAID FOR PROGRAMMING; JUST-NOT PAID AS MUCH AS-NOW.------------ RESTRICTING COPYING IS NOT THE ONLY BASIS FOR BUSINESS IN SOFTWARE.-IT IS THE MOST COMMON BASIS BECAUSE IT BRINGS IN THE MOST MONEY.- IF IT-WERE PROHIBITED, OR REJECTED BY THE CUSTOMER, SOFTWARE BUSINESS WOULD-MOVE TO OTHER BASES OF ORGANIZATION WHICH ARE NOW USED LESS OFTEN.-THERE ARE ALWAYS NUMEROUS WAYS TO ORGANIZE ANY KIND OF BUSINESS.------------ PROBABLY PROGRAMMING WILL NOT BE AS LUCRATIVE ON THE NEW BASIS AS IT-IS NOW.- BUT THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE CHANGE.- IT IS NOT-CONSIDERED AN INJUSTICE THAT SALES CLERKS MAKE THE SALARIES THAT THEY-NOW DO.- IF PROGRAMMERS MADE THE SAME, THAT WOULD NOT BE AN INJUSTICE-EITHER.- (IN PRACTICE THEY WOULD STILL MAKE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN-THAT.)------------------- "DON'T PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HOW THEIR CREATIVITY IS----- USED?------------------" "CONTROL OVER THE USE OF ONE'S IDEAS" REALLY CONSTITUTES CONTROL OVER-OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES; AND IT IS USUALLY USED TO MAKE THEIR LIVES MORE-DIFFICULT.------------ PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED THE ISSUE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS-------------------------------------------(6)-----CAREFULLY (SUCH AS LAWYERS) SAY THAT THERE IS NO INTRINSIC RIGHT TO-INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.- THE KINDS OF SUPPOSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES WERE CREATED BY SPECIFIC ACTS OF-LEGISLATION FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES.------------ FOR EXAMPLE, THE PATENT SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED TO ENCOURAGE-INVENTORS TO DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF THEIR INVENTIONS.- ITS PURPOSE WAS-TO HELP SOCIETY RATHER THAN TO HELP INVENTORS.- AT-THE TIME, THE LIFE-SPAN OF 17 YEARS FOR A PATENT WAS SHORT COMPARED WITH THE RATE OF-ADVANCE OF THE STATE OF THE ART.- SINCE PATENTS ARE AN ISSUE ONLY AMONG-MANUFACTURERS, FOR WHOM THE COST AND EFFORT OF A LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE-SMALL COMPARED WITH SETTING UP PRODUCTION,-THE PATENTS OFTEN DO NOT DO-MUCH HARM.- THEY DO NOT OBSTRUCT MOST INDIVIDUALS WHO USE PATENTED-PRODUCTS.------------ THE IDEA OF COPYRIGHT DID NOT EXIST IN ANCIENT TIMES, WHEN AUTHORS-FREQUENTLY COPIED OTHER AUTHORS AT LENGTH IN WORKS OF NON-FICTION.- THIS-PRACTICE WAS USEFUL, AND IS-THE ONLY WAY MANY AUTHORS' WORKS HAVE-SURVIVED EVEN IN PART.- THE COPYRIGHT SYSTEM-WAS CREATED EXPRESSLY FOR-THE PURPOSE-OF ENCOURAGING AUTHORSHIP.- IN THE DOMAIN FOR WHICH IT WAS-INVENTED--BOOKS, WHICH COULD BE COPIED ECONOMICALLY ONLY ON A PRINTING-PRESS--IT DID LITTLE HARM, AND DID NOT OBSTRUCT MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS-WHO READ THE BOOKS.------------ ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE JUST LICENSES GRANTED BY SOCIETY-BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, THAT SOCIETY AS A WHOLE-WOULD BENEFIT BY GRANTING THEM.- BUT IN ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION, WE-HAVE TO ASK: ARE WE REALLY BETTER OFF GRANTING SUCH LICENSE?- WHAT KIND-OF ACT ARE WE LICENSING A PERSON TO DO?------------ THE CASE OF PROGRAMS TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF BOOKS A-HUNDRED YEARS AGO.- THE FACT THAT THE EASIEST WAY TO COPY A PROGRAM IS-FROM ONE NEIGHBOR TO ANOTHER, THE FACT THAT A PROGRAM HAS BOTH SOURCE-CODE AND OBJECT CODE WHICH ARE DISTINCT, AND THE FACT THAT A PROGRAM IS-USED RATHER THAN READ AND ENJOYED, COMBINE TO CREATE A SITUATION IN-WHICH A PERSON WHO ENFORCES A COPYRIGHT IS HARMING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE-BOTH MATERIALLY AND SPIRITUALLY; IN WHICH A PERSON SHOULD NOT DO SO-REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW ENABLES HIM TO.------------------ "COMPETITION MAKES THINGS GET DONE BETTER.---------------------" THE PARADIGM OF COMPETITION IS A RACE: BY REWARDING THE WINNER, WE-ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO RUN FASTER.- WHEN CAPITALISM REALLY WORKS THIS-WAY, IT DOES A GOOD JOB; BUT ITS DEFENDERS ARE WRONG IN ASSUMING IT-ALWAYS WORKS THIS WAY.- IF THE RUNNERS FORGET WHY THE REWARD IS OFFERED-AND BECOME INTENT ON WINNING, NO MATTER HOW, THEY MAY FIND OTHER-STRATEGIES--SUCH AS, ATTACKING OTHER RUNNERS.- IF THE RUNNERS GET INTO-A FIST FIGHT, THEY WILL ALL FINISH LATE.------------ PROPRIETARY AND SECRET SOFTWARE IS THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF RUNNERS-IN A FIST FIGHT.- SAD TO SAY, THE ONLY REFEREE WE'VE GOT DOES NOT SEEM-TO OBJECT TO FIGHTS; HE JUST REGULATES THEM ("FOR EVERY TEN YARDS YOU-RUN, YOU CAN FIRE ONE SHOT").- HE REALLY OUGHT TO BREAK THEM UP, AND-PENALIZE RUNNERS-FOR EVEN TRYING TO FIGHT.------------------- "WON'T EVERYONE STOP PROGRAMMING WITHOUT A MONETARY INCENTIVE?---------------------" ACTUALLY, MANY PEOPLE WILL PROGRAM WITH ABSOLUTELY NO MONETARY-INCENTIVE.- PROGRAMMING HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION FOR SOME-PEOPLE, USUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEST AT IT.- THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF-PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS WHO KEEP AT IT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NO HOPE OF-MAKING A LIVING THAT WAY.------------ BUT REALLY THIS QUESTION, THOUGH COMMONLY ASKED, IS NOT APPROPRIATE-TOVTHE SITUATION.- PAY FOR PROGRAMMERS WILL NOT DISAPPEAR,-ONLY BECOME-LESS.- SO THE RIGHT QUESTION IS, WILL ANYONE PROGRAM WITH A REDUCED-MONETARY INCENTIVE?- MY EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THEY WILL.------------ FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS, MANY OF THE WORLD'S BEST PROGRAMMERS WORKED-AT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAB FOR FAR LESS MONEY THAN THEY COULD-HAVE HAD ANYWHERE ELSE.- THEY GOT MANY KINDS OF NON-MONETARY REWARDS:-FAME AND APPRECIATION, FOR EXAMPLE.--AND CREATIVITY IS ALSO FUN, A-REWARD IN ITSELF.------------ THEN-MOST OF THEM LEFT WHEN OFFERED A CHANCE TO DO THE SAME-INTERESTING WORK FOR A LOT OF MONEY.------------ WHAT THE FACTS SHOW IS THAT PEOPLE WILL PROGRAM FOR REASONS OTHER-THAN RICHES; BUT IF GIVEN A CHANCE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AS WELL, THEY-WILL COME TO EXPECT-AND DEMAND IT.- LOW-PAYING-ORGANIZATIONS DO POORLY-IN COMPETITION WITH HIGH-PAYING ONES, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO DO BADLY-IF THE HIGH-PAYING ONES ARE BANNED.---------------------- "WE NEED THE-PROGRAMMERS DESPERATELY.- IF THEY DEMAND THAT WE STOP----- HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS, WE HAVE TO OBEY.---------------------" YOU'RE NEVER SO DESPERATE THAT YOU HAVE TO OBEY THIS SORT OF DEMAND.-REMEMBER: MILLIONS FOR-DEFENSE, BUT NOT A CENT FOR TRIBUTE-------------------! "PROGRAMMERS NEED TO MAKE A-LIVING SOMEHOW.---------------------" IN THE SHORT RUN, THIS IS TRUE.- HOWEVER, THERE-ARE PLENTY-OF WAYS-THAT PROGRAMMERS COULD MAKE A LIVING WITHOUT SELLING THE RIGHT TO USE A-PROGRAM.- THIS WAY IS CUSTOMARY NOW BECAUSE IT BRINGS PROGRAMMERS AND-BUSINESSMEN THE MOST MONEY, NOT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY-WAY TO MAKE A-LIVING.- IT IS EASY TO FIND OTHER WAYS IF YOU WANT TO FIND THEM.- HERE-ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES.------------ A MANUFACTURER INTRODUCING A NEW COMPUTER WILL PAY FOR THE PORTING OF-OPERATING SYSTEMS ONTO THE NEW HARDWARE.------------ THE SALE OF TEACHING, HAND-HOLDING AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES COULD-ALSO EMPLOY PROGRAMMERS.------------ PEOPLE WITH NEW IDEAS COULD DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS AS-FREEWARE-------------------------------------------(7)----, ASKING FOR-DONATIONS FROM SATISFIED USERS, OR SELLING HAND-HOLDING SERVICES.- I-HAVE MET PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING THIS WAY SUCCESSFULLY.-------------USERS WITH-RELATED NEEDS CAN-FORM USERS' GROUPS, AND PAY DUES.- A-GROUP WOULD CONTRACT WITH PROGRAMMING COMPANIES TO WRITE PROGRAMS THAT-THE GROUP'S MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO USE.------------ ALL SORTS OF DEVELOPMENT CAN BE FUNDED WITH A SOFTWARE TAX:-------------- SUPPOSE EVERYONE WHO BUYS A COMPUTER HAS TO PAY X PERCENT OF THE----- PRICE AS A SOFTWARE TAX.- THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THIS TO AN AGENCY----- LIKE THE NSF TO SPEND ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.-------------- BUT IF THE COMPUTER BUYER MAKES A DONATION TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT----- HIMSELF, HE CAN TAKE A CREDIT AGAINST THE TAX.- HE CAN DONATE TO----- THE PROJECT OF HIS OWN CHOOSING--OFTEN, CHOSEN BECAUSE HE HOPES TO----- USE THE RESULTS WHEN IT IS DONE.- HE CAN TAKE A CREDIT FOR ANY----- AMOUNT OF DONATION UP TO THE TOTAL TAX HE HAD TO PAY.-------------- THE TOTAL TAX RATE COULD BE DECIDED BY A VOTE OF THE PAYERS OF THE----- TAX, WEIGHTED ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT THEY WILL BE TAXED ON.-------------- THE CONSEQUENCES:-------------- THE COMPUTER-USING COMMUNITY SUPPORTS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.--------- THIS COMMUNITY DECIDES WHAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS NEEDED.--------- USERS WHO CARE WHICH PROJECTS THEIR SHARE IS SPENT ON CAN---------- CHOOSE THIS FOR THEMSELVES.------------------ IN THE LONG RUN, MAKING PROGRAMS FREE IS A STEP TOWARD THE-POST-SCARCITY WORLD, WHERE NOBODY WILL HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD JUST TO-MAKE A LIVING.- PEOPLE WILL BE FREE TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO ACTIVITIES-THAT ARE FUN, SUCH AS PROGRAMMING, AFTER SPENDING THE NECESSARY TEN-HOURS A WEEK ON REQUIRED TASKS SUCH AS LEGISLATION, FAMILY COUNSELING,-ROBOT REPAIR AND ASTEROID PROSPECTING.- THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO BE-ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING FROM PROGRAMMING.------------ WE HAVE ALREADY GREATLY REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THE WHOLE-SOCIETY MUST DO FOR ITS ACTUAL PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ONLY A LITTLE OF THIS-HAS TRANSLATED ITSELF INTO LEISURE FOR WORKERS BECAUSE MUCH-NONPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY IS REQUIRED TO ACCOMPANY PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY.-THE MAIN CAUSES OF THIS ARE BUREAUCRACY AND ISOMETRIC STRUGGLES AGAINST-COMPETITION.- FREE SOFTWARE WILL GREATLY REDUCE THESE DRAINS IN THE-AREA OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTION.- WE MUST DO THIS, IN ORDER FOR TECHNICAL-GAINS IN PRODUCTIVITY TO TRANSLATE INTO LESS WORK FOR US.----------------  FOOTNOTES-------------------------------------------------------- (1)---- THE WORDING HERE WAS CARELESS.- THE-INTENTION WAS THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR *PERMISSION--TO USE-THE GNU SYSTEM.- BUT THE WORDS DON'T MAKE THIS CLEAR, AND PEOPLE OFTEN-INTERPRET THEM AS SAYING THAT COPIES OF GNU SHOULD ALWAYS BE-DISTRIBUTED AT LITTLE OR NO CHARGE.- THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT; LATER-ON, THE MANIFESTO MENTIONS THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPANIES PROVIDING THE-SERVICE OF DISTRIBUTION FOR A PROFIT.- SUBSEQUENTLY I HAVE LEARNED TO-DISTINGUISH CAREFULLY BETWEEN "FREE" IN THE SENSE OF FREEDOM AND-"FREE" IN THE SENSE OF PRICE.- FREE SOFTWARE IS SOFTWARE THAT USERS-HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE AND CHANGE.- SOME USERS MAY OBTAIN-COPIES AT NO CHARGE, WHILE OTHERS PAY TO OBTAIN COPIES--AND IF THE-FUNDS HELP SUPPORT IMPROVING THE SOFTWARE, SO MUCH THE BETTER.- THE-IMPORTANT THING IS THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS A COPY HAS THE FREEDOM TO-COOPERATE WITH OTHERS IN USING IT.------------------------------------------------------- (2)---- THIS IS ANOTHER PLACE I FAILED TO-DISTINGUISH CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF "FREE".-THE STATEMENT AS IT STANDS IS NOT FALSE--YOU CAN GET COPIES OF GNU-SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE, FROM YOUR FRIENDS OR OVER THE NET.--BUT IT DOES-SUGGEST-THE WRONG IDEA.------------------------------------------------------- (3)----- SEVERAL SUCH COMPANIES NOW EXIST.------------------------------------------------------- (4)---- THE FREE-SOFTWARE FOUNDATION FOR 10 YEARS RAISED MOST OF ITS FUNDS FROM A-DISTRIBUTION SERVICE, ALTHOUGH IT IS A CHARITY RATHER-THAN A COMPANY.-YOU CAN---------------------------- ORDER THINGS FROM THE FSF----.-------------------------------------------------------- (5)---- A GROUP OF-COMPUTER COMPANIES POOLED FUNDS AROUND 1991 TO SUPPORT MAINTENANCE OF-THE GNU C COMPILER.------------------------------------------------------- (6)-----IN THE 80S I HAD NOT YET REALIZED HOW CONFUSING IT WAS TO SPEAK OF-"THE ISSUE" OF "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY".--THAT TERM IS OBVIOUSLY-BIASED; MORE SUBTLE IS THE FACT-THAT IT LUMPS TOGETHER VARIOUS-DISPARATE LAWS WHICH RAISE VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES.--NOWADAYS I-URGE-PEOPLE TO REJECT THE TERM "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" ENTIRELY, LEST IT-LEAD OTHERS TO SUPPOSE THAT THOSE LAWS FORM ONE COHERENT ISSUE.- THE-WAY TO BE CLEAR IS TO DISCUSS PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS-SEPARATELY.- SEE------------------------------------------------------- FURTHER EXPLANATION---- OF HOW THIS TERM SPREADS CONFUSION AND-BIAS.------------------------------------------------------- (7)-----SUBSEQUENTLY WE HAVE LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH-BETWEEN "FREE SOFTWARE" AND "FREEWARE".- THE TERM "FREEWARE" MEANS-SOFTWARE YOU ARE FREE TO REDISTRIBUTE, BUT USUALLY-YOU ARE NOT FREE TO-STUDY AND CHANGE THE-SOURCE CODE, SO MOST OF IT IS NOT FREE SOFTWARE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------THE CONFUSING WORDS AND PHRASES PAGE---- FOR MORE EXPLANATION.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
