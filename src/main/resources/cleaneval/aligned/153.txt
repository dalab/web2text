OF COMPUTING AT CERN - PART---------------------------------------------------------------- 1 PAOLO ZANELLA-----, FORMER DIVISION LEADER OF DD--------------------------------------------------------------------  ABSTRACT------------- THIS-IS THE FIRST OF A THREE-PART SERIES,-MADE OUT OF THE ORIGINAL (EXCELLENT) PAPER-WRITTEN BY PAOLO ZANELLA-IN------ I HOPE THAT IT CAN SERVE FUTURE COMPUTORIANS-TO WRITE "IT AT CERN: ITS BIRTH, ITS LIFE ...---------MIGUEL MARQUINA (EDITOR)--------------------------  INTRODUCTION------------- THE ORIGINS OF COMPUTING MACHINERY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO- 3000YEARS AGO WHEN THE CHINESE INTRODUCED A PRIMITIVE FORM OF ABACUS,-OR 300 YEARS AGO WHEN SCHICKARD, PASCAL AND LEIBNIZ INVENTED THE-FIRST ARITHMETIC MACHINES. FOR US AT CERN IT ALL STARTED 30 YEARS-AGO WHEN ONE OF THE FIRST ELECTRONIC DIGITAL COMPUTERS, A HUGE-FERRANTI MERCURY, WAS INSTALLED.-IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A SUCCESS-STORY WHICH HAS CHANGED THE WAY TO DO PHYSICS AND, AS A MATTER OF-FACT, TO DO ANY WORK AT ALL IN THE LABORATORY.-------- THE STORY GOES ON AND THE CHANGES BROUGHT IN BY THE NEW-INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE-TO AFFECT US AT AN ASTONISHING-RATE. THOSE WHO WITNESSED THE BEGINNING OF THE INFORMATION ERA WERE-CONSCIOUS OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THOSE MAR MARVELLOUS MACHINES-ON PHYSICS AS-WELL AS ON SOCIETY, BUT THEY COULD HARDLY IMAGINE-WHAT WAS TO COME. IN RETROSPECT, WE CAN SAY THAT THE 30 YEARS WHICH-SEPARATE US FROM THE DAYS OF THOSE FIRST GENERATION MACHINES, HAVE-BEEN YEARS OF STRUGGLE,-OF SWEAT AND TEA TEARS, OF DOUBT AND OF-PAINFUL REAPPRAISAL, BUT ALSO YEARS OF DISCOVERY, OF EXCITEMENT, OF-ACHIEVEMENT AND OF PRIDE TO THE ACTORS IN THIS UNIQUE-ADVENTURE.-------- OF THOSE 30 CERN YEARS, I MISSED ONLY THE FIRST THREE. I DID NOT-MISS, HOWEVER, THE JOYS OF PROGRAMMING FIRST GENERATION MACHINES,-ALTHOUGH IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. ACTUALLY, WHEN I JOINED CERN-EARLY IN 1962, THE ONLY MACHINES AROUND WERE STILL MADE OUT OF-VACUUM TUBES. I-AM, THEREFORE, RATHER-WELL PLACED TO TELL MY-PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE----WHAT, WHY AND HOW---- OF THE EVOLUTION-OF AUTOMATIC COMPUTING AT CERN.-------- I SHALL NOT EVEN ATTEMPT-TO BE EXHAUSTIVE, LET ALONE OBJECTIVE.-I SHALL TELL-THE STORY AS I SAW IT,-OR RATHER AS I LIVED-IT.-INSTEAD OF COMPRESSING----800 HOURS INTO 1, I SHALL SELECT AND-REPORT ONLY THOSE EVENTS WHICH, IN MY OPINION,-ARE EITHER REAL-MILESTONES OR MAKE AN INTERESTING-STORY, AND I SHALL FOLLOW THEM-THROUGH TO THEIR CONSEQUENCES, EVEN IF THIS MEANS BREAKING THE-STRICT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE LARGE-HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE CERN-COMPUTER CENTER ARE LISTED IN-------------------- APPENDIX-----------------------THE BIG BANG--------------IT TOOK SIX DAYS FOR-GOD TO BUILD THE UNIVERSE AND A LITTLE OVER-TWO YEARS FOR THE FERRANTI ENGINEERS TO PRODUCE OUR--- MERCURY----,-A LARGE ASSEMBLY OF COMPLEX-CIRCUITRY HIDDEN INSIDE A ROW OF-AUSTERE CABINETS, MAKING FEW CONCESSIONS-ONS TO PEOPLE'S CURIOSITY.-AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE PS WAS BUILT IN FIVE YEARS AND TODAY ONE-CAN BUILD ACCELERATORS 1000 TIMES MORE POWERFUL, ALWAYS IN ABOUT-FIVE YEARS. THE MERCURY WAS 1000 TIMES LESS POWERFUL (16.6 KHZ)-THAN A MODERN PERSONAL COMPUTER WHICH IS NOW MASS-PRODUCED BY-ROBOTIZED ASSEMBLY LINES AT THE RATE OF 2 OR 3 PER MINUTE--------! THE PURCHASING CONTRACT WAS SIGNED ON THE 25TH OF MAY, 1956 AND-STIPULATED THAT--- THE MACHINE WITH 1024 40-BIT WORDS OF-------- FAST---- [ 120 MICROSEC TO READ/WRITE ONE WORD FROM THE-ACCUMULATOR---] CORE STORE------- AND A--- SLOW-------- [8.75 MSEC-LATENCY---] DRUM STORE------- HAVING A TOTAL CAPACITY OF- 16384WORDS OF 40 BINARY DIGITS,---- WOULD BE SHIPPED TO CERN--- IN EARLY-FEBRUARY 1957 AND INSTALLATION SHALL BE COMPLETED BY 1ST MAY,-1957.... THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRESS OF MANUFACTURE WILL BE-SUBMITTED AT INTERVALS OF ONE MONTH.---- THE MERCURY HAD A CLOCK-CYCLE OF 60 MICROSEC. IT TOOK 180 MICROSEC TO ADD AND 300 MICROSEC-TO MULTIPLY TWO LONG WORDS OF 40 BITS. IT HAD FLOATING POINT-ARITHMETIC. DIVISION, HOWEVER, HAD TO BE PROGRAMMED. IT IS-INTERESTING TO NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THE WORD--- SOFTWARE---- FROM-THE CONTRACT, THE ONLY RELEVANT MENTION BEING:----ANY PROGRAMS AND-SUB-ROUTINES WHICH FERRANTI WILL PREPARE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO-CERN FREE OF CHARGE.---- UNBUNDLING AND LICENSING WERE UNKNOWN-IN THE 50'S.-------- THE COMPUTER ACTUALLY ARRIVED DURING THE SUMMER OF-------- 1958AND PASSED THE ACCEPTANCE TESTS IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR. FOLLOWING-ITS SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION, A THICK FILE OF ORDERS REVEALED THE-URGENT NEED FOR SPARE VALVES AND OF--- TAPE BINS---- (A CRITICAL-DEVICE IN THOSE DAYS OF PUNCHED PAPER TAPE INPUT/OUTPUT!).-------- AT THE END OF 1958, THE AVAILABILITY OF A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE-CALLED--------- AUTOCODE-----------, ATTRACTED THE FIRST USERS TO-THE COMPUTER CENTRE AND MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE 30 YEARS OF-COMPUTING COVERED BY THIS PAPER. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE-FIRST------ MERCURY AUTOCODE------- COMPILER WAS WRITTEN IN- 1956(BY R. A. BROOKER), TWO YEARS BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST----FORTRAN---- COMPILER! IT HAD MANY FEATURES WHICH APPEARED LATER-IN FORTRAN. DUE TO MEMORY LIMITATIONS, VARIABLE NAMES WERE-RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE ALPHABETIC CHARACTER (5-BIT FERRANTI CODE).-IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE MID 50'S THE EUROPEAN COMPUTER-INDUSTRY WAS STILL COMPETITIVE. AS FAR AS COMPETENCE, INNOVATIVE-IDEAS AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS ARE CONCERNED, EUROPEAN COMPANIES-LIKE------ FERRANTI, ENGLISH ELECTRIC------- AND------- ELLIOTT------- IN ENGLAND,------ TELEFUNKEN------- IN GERMANY AND-------BULL------- IN FRANCE HAD LITTLE TO ENVY THEIR AMERICAN-COMPETITORS (E.G.------ ERA/REMINGTON RAND, NCR, IBM-------). THE-SIZE AND THE DRIVE OF THE AMERICAN MARKET WERE, HOWEVER, GOING TO-MAKE THE DIFFERENCE QUITE RAPIDLY IN THE 60'S.-------- THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO ACQUIRE A MERCURY WERE-TECHNICAL, POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL. TECHNICALLY THE MERCURY WAS-DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINES AROUND. IT WAS-CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO THE FERRANTI PEGASUS, TO THE ELLIOTT 404,-TO-THE ENGLISH ELECTRIC 'DEUCE', TO THE BULL 'GAMMA 311' AND TO-DRUM-TYPE MACHINES LIKE THE IBM----- FERRANTI WAS SET UP TO PRODUCE-A DOZEN UNITS AND CERN WAS GOING TO GET SERIAL NUMBER--- THE FACT-THAT HARWELL AND SACLAY HAD ORDERED MERCURY'S WAS GIVEN A CERTAIN-WEIGHT. CERN HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN ELECTRONIC DIGITAL-COMPUTERS AND-IT WAS BETTER TO BE PART OF A CLUB OF USERS. AS TO THE PRICE (ONE-MILLION SWISS FRANCS), IT WAS FIVE TIMES CHEAPER THAN EQUIVALENT-AMERICAN MACHINES LIKE THE ERA-------------- DISCUSSIONS WENT ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT CERN IN 1955 AND 1956.-EXTERNAL EXPERTS WERE INVOLVED. FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER KONRAD ZUSE'S-RELAY-BASED Z3 CONSIDERED BY MANY AS THE FIRST GENERAL PURPOSE-COMPUTER, TEN YEARS AFTER THE ELECTRONIC ENIAC, AND SIX YEARS AFTER-MAURICE-WILKES' EDSAC, PEOPLE WERE STILL DEBATING ON THE VIRTUES OF-BINARY VERSUS DECIMAL MACHINES, ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FLOATING POINT-ARITHMETIC, ON THE SIZE OF WORDS (THE Z3 HAD 22-BIT AND THE EDSAC-32-BIT WORDS; THE ENIAC WAS A DECIMAL MACHINE WITH 10 DIGITS-WORDS. THE SIZE OF CENTRAL MEMORY WAS 64 WORDS FOR THE Z3, 2N FOR-THE ENIAC AND 512 FOR THE EDSAQ, AND ON THE BEST WAY TO INPUT AND-OUTPUT DATA (PUNCHED FILM, 5-7-8 CHANNELS PAPERTAPE, OR CARDS).-PRACTICAL PROBLEMS HAD TO DO WITH THE UNRELIABILITY OF THE-HARDWARE, THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OPERATIONS AND THE RECRUITMENT OF-EXPERTS. OBSOLESCENCE WAS ALREADY A PROBLEM.-------- CERN DECIDED THAT THE MACHINE SHOULD BE PURELY BINARY, THAT-32-BIT WORDS WERE TOO SHORT, AND THAT THE SPEED SHOULD BE AS HIGH-AS POSSIBLE (IN PARTICULAR MULTIPLICATION TIME SHOULD BE UNDER A-MILLISECOND). IT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE SPEED AND SIZE OF-MEMORY WERE VERY IMPORTANT--- (SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BINARY-DIGITS---- WERE A CLEAR NECESSITY), WHILE THE AVAILABILITY OF-FLOATING POINT HARDWARE WAS CONSIDERED A--- VERY DESIRABLE,-ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE INDISPENSABLE, FEATURE OF A SCIENTIFIC-COMPUTER.---- BUT WHAT REALLY--- MAKES IT WORTHWHILE TO HAVE A-MACHINE, IS THE ENTHUSIASM FOR CARRYING OUT THE MOST DIFFICULT-COMPUTATIONS,---- AS AN AMERICAN PHYSICIST PUT IT IN A LETTER-DESCRIBING HIS EXPERIENCE WITH A DIGITAL COMPUTER OR--- 'THE-COURAGE TO GO AHEAD AND SOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD HAVE SEEMED TOO-DIFFICULT TO DO OTHERWISE.'------------- THE COMPUTERS OF THAT TIME HAD COLORFUL NAMES LIKE ILLIAC AT THE-UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, AVIDAC AT ARGONNE, MANIAC, UNIVAC, ETC...-MOST OF THEM WERE PROTOTYPES. EVERYTHING WAS VERY MUCH-EXPERIMENTAL. THE OPERATIONS ARRANGEMENTS AT THE ILLIAC WERE-DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:--- 'THE USER DEPOSITS HIS PUNCHED PAPER TAPE-IN A BOX WITH INSTRUCTIONS OR THE OPERATOR. THE OPERATOR TAKES-THESE TAPES, AND INSERTS THEM IN THE MACHINE IN TURN. IF THE CODE-IS CORRECT, THE MACHINE DELIVERS THE ANSWERS AND THESE MAY BE-PICKED UP BY THE USER THE NEXT MORNING. IF THERE ARE ERRORS IN THE-CODE, THE OPERATOR CARRIES OUT THE TEST ROUTINES REQUESTED AND THE-RESULTS OF THESE TESTS ARE DEPOSITED SO THAT THESE MAY BE REVIEWED-BY THE USER THE NEXT MORNING. THUS, THE WHOLE OPERATION OF THE-MACHINE BECOMES A FAIRLY AUTOMATIC AFFAIR'.---- THIS WAS MORE OR-LESS THE STYLE ADOPTED FOR OUR OPERATIONS THIRTY YEARS AGO.-------- ONE OF THE FIRST APPLICATIONS AT CERN WAS THE ANALYSIS OF THE-PAPERTAPE PRODUCED BY THE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE EVALUATION OF-PHOTOGRAPHS (IEPS), USED TO SCAN AND MEASURE BUBBLE CHAMBER FILM.-THE FIRST REPORTS CONVEY A CERTAIN DECEPTION DUE TO THE SLOW TAPE-READ/WRITE SPEED. SINCE EVERYTHING HAD TO GO THROUGH THE-ACCUMULATOR, THE CPU WAS BLOCKED DURING I---/IT WAS IMMEDIATELY-CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A BIG MISMATCH BETWEEN THE POWER OF THE-COMPUTING ENGINE AND ITS INPUT/OUTPUT CAPABILITY.-------- AFTER SOME STRUGGLING WITH FAULTY TUBES, TAPE BINS, MACHINE-INSTRUCTIONS AND------ AUTOCODE-------, PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF DATA-DISCOVERED THE EXISTENCE OF AN IBM 704 IN PARIS, WHICH OFFERED-SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES SUCH AS--- MAGNETIC TAPE UNITS, CARD-READERS, LINE PRINTERS AND FORTRAN----! FORTRAN II ALLOWED---CHARACTERS VARIABLE NAMES AND, MOST IMPORTANT, IT SIMPLIFIED THE-EXCHANGE OF PROGRAMS WITH BERKELEY AND BROOKHAVEN. THE 1959 CERN-ANNUAL REPORT INDICATED--- ALREADY---- THAT--- AS THE NEEDS-INCREASE, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ENVISAGE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE-MERCURY BY A MORE POWERFUL SYSTEM.---- IT WAS ALSO QUICKLY REALIZED-THAT THESE SO-CALLED ELECTRONIC BRAINS REQUIRED QUITE A LOT OF-HUMAN EFFORT TO BE EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED. HENCE THE PROPOSAL TO-DOUBLE IN 1960 THE COMPUTER CENTER STAFF (FROM 10 TO 20).-------- SO, BY THE END OF THE 5-'S, THE-FUNDAMENTAL FORCES, SOCIOLOGICAL-AND TECHNOLOGICAL, CHARACTERISTIC OF-EVERY COMPUTER SERVICE, HAD-BEEN DISCOVERED, INCLUDING THE ILLUSION THAT UPGRADING THE-RESOURCES WOULD SOLVE ALL-THE PROBLEMS AND ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE-GOAL, I.E.--- MAKE THE USERS HAPPY--------------------! THE LESSONS OF THE EARLY 60'S------------- THE NEXT BIG NEWS WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE--- IBM 709,---- AN-IMPROVED VERSION OF THE 704, IN JANUARY------ IT WAS STILL A CLUMSY-VACUUM TUBE MACHINE BUT IT-FEATURED FORTRAN AND-ALL THOSE FANCY-PERIPHERALS APT TO IMPROVE THE--- QUALITY OF LIFE----.-------- THE WORD LENGTH WAS 36 BITS, THE CHARACTERS BECAME 6-BIT BCD,-AND THE CORE MEMORY SIZE JUMPED TO 32K. THE CPU WAS 4-5 TIMES-FASTER THAN THAT OF THE MERCURY. HOWEVER, TO COMPILE A--- TYPICAL-FORTRAN PROGRAM COULD TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES----! TAPE BINS MADE WAY-FOR CARD TRAYS. MAGNETIC TAPE UNITS READ AND WROTE AT 75 IPS ON---TRACKS AND THE DENSITY WAS 200 BPI. PERIPHERALS WERE ATTACHED VIA-THEIR CONTROLLERS TO DATA CHANNELS. IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN-THAT IT ALLOWED AS MANY AS SIX PERIPHERAL DEVICES TO ACCESS CORE-MEMORY BUFFERS WHILE THE CPU PERFORMED OTHER WORK. ANOTHER-IMPORTANT DEVICE WHICH CAME WITH THE 709 WAS THE SO-CALLED DIRECT-DATA CONNECTION, ALLOWING FOR DIRECT TRANSMISSION OF DATA FROM-EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT TO MEMORY VIA A CHANNEL. THE SPEED WAS NOT-RIDICULOUS: IN PRINCIPLE UP TO 1 MEGABIT/SEC. THE 709 WAS ALSO-EQUIPPED WITH ONE OF THE FIRST--- INTERRUPT SYSTEMS.------------- THE BAD NEWS WAS STILL THE POOR RELIABILITY, ALTHOUGH THE-PROGRESS WAS ALREADY-QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE-REPRESENTED 11% OF THE TOTAL TIME. SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE TOOK AWAY-A TIME SLICE OF SIMILAR SIZE. SO THE DOWN-TIME OF THE 709 COMPARED-NOT TOO UNFAVORABLY WITH THE UP TIME OF THE VERY FIRST ELECTRONIC-COMPUTERS.... THE ON-LINE CARD-READER AND THE PRINTER DID, HOWEVER,-SLOW DOWN THE OPERATIONS-CONSIDERABLY. AFTER ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE-CERN ADDED A SMALL IBM 1401, IN ORDER TO SPEED UP THE INPUT/OUTPUT,-THE JOB SEQUENCING AND THE OPERATIONS. THE CONCEPT OF SPOOLING-(SIMULTANEOUS PERIPHERAL OPERATION ON-LINE) WITH ITS 1/0 FILES-(VIRTUAL READER/PRINTER)-HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THOSE DAYS. PROGRAMMING-FOR THE 709 WAS CONSIDERED A DIFFICULT ACTIVITY TO BE LEFT TO THE-SPECIALISTS WHO COULD UNDERSTAND AND KEEP UP-TO-DATE WITH THE NEW-TECHNIQUES AND THE OPERATING CONVENTIONS. THE MACHINE WAS--- AN-EXPENSIVE RESOURCE---- WHICH HAD TO BE USED EFFICIENTLY. TO GIVE AN-IDEA, THE LIST PRICE WAS IN THE REGION OF TEN MILLIONS FRANCS-(1960 SWISS FRANCS!). IN THOSE DAYS A--- MAGNETIC TAPE COST- 60 $(SOME---- 260 SF!). IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THE FIRST INESCAPABLE-COMMITTEES--- APPEARED, E.G.---- COMPUTER SCHEDULING COMMITTEE,-COMPUTER USERS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE DATA HANDLING POLICY-GROUP.-------- THE MERCURY HAD STILL ITS FAITHFUL USERS-BUT SUFFERED FROM THE-CHRONIC LACK OF MODERN, FAST PERIPHERALS. IN 1962, AS PART OF A-LIFTING OPERATION, IT WAS ENHANCED BY THE CONNECTION OF AN AMPEX-TAPE UNIT,--- COMPATIBLE WITH IBM SPECIFICATIONS---- AND OPERATING-AT 3333 CHARACTERS PER SECOND (OVER 3 TIMES THE SPEED OF THE-FASTEST PAPER TAPE READER AND SOME 20 TIMES FASTER THAN A TAPE-PUNCH). ALSO, TWO PAPERTAPE-TO-CARD CONVERTERS WERE INSTALLED--- TO-EASE THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM THE MERCURY TO THE--------- BY THE-END OF 1962 IT WAS POSSIBLE TO READ THE PAPER TAPE FROM IEPS INTO-THE MERCURY, GIVE IT A FIRST PROCESSING PASS, WRITE THE RESULTS-ON MAGNETIC TAPE AND INPUT IT ONTO THE IBM 709 FOR FURTHER-ANALYSIS.-THE FIRST APPLICATION PACKAGES APPEARED AT THAT TIME,-E.G. THRESH AND GRIND USED FOR-THE GEOMETRICAL RECONSTRUCTION AND-KINEMATIC ANALYSIS OF BUBBLE-CHAMBER EVENTS. IT IS AMUSING TO NOTE-THAT, IN SPITE OF THE GROWING WORKLOAD AND THE FRANTIC DEVELOPMENT-OF CODES, THE MACHINES WERE-NORMALLY SWITCHED OFF AT WEEKENDS. BUT-THE PRACTICE OF 24 HOURS/DAY, 7-DAYS/WEEK SERVICE WAS AROUND THE-CORNER. IT IS ALSO IN INTERESTING TO REALIZE THAT THINGS LIKE THE-CONNECTION OF THE AMPEX TAPE UNIT TO THE MERCURY WERE ENTIRELY-DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED ON SITE.-------- THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS HOW TO USE ALL THOSE------ AUTOCODE--------PROGRAMS ON THE----- ONE JUST WROTE AN------ AUTOCODE--------COMPILER FOR THE----- THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE WERE-SOON TO BE LEARNED. THE FIRST CONFERENCE RECOGNIZING THE EXISTENCE-OF A SOFTWARE CRISIS WAS HELD IN MUNICH IN------ WHY IS SOFTWARE-ALWAYS LATE AND UNRELIABLE? PEOPLE WORKING TODAY WITH MODERN CASE-(COMPUTER ASSISTED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING) OR OOP (OBJECT ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING) TOOLS ARE STILL TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT THE-ANSWER IN THOSE DAYS WAS: ---BETTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES----.-------- CERN FORTRAN WAS DEFINED TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER-LABORATORIES AND FACILITATE PORTABILITY OF CODES. IT WAS FELT,-HOWEVER, THAT FORTRAN WAS USED--- MAINLY FOR HISTORICAL REASONS-----AND NEW, MORE POWERFUL LANGUAGES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FULLY EXPLOIT-THE POTENTIAL OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER. AS WE ALL KNOW, CERN WAS-NOT AFFECTED BY, OR IT MISSED COMPLETELY, THE LANGUAGE EXPLOSION-WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 60'S. ALGOL, LISP, PL/I, PASCAL, MODULA-II, ADA, C, PROLOG, ETC... DID NOT RAISE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF-MINORITY CULTURES. FORTRAN EVOLVED THROUGH ITS VERSIONS II, IV, 66,-77, 8X, AND-IT STILL DOMINATES THE CERN PROGRAMMING LANDSCAPE.---------IT TOOK SOME TIME TO-SATURATE THE 709, BUT IT WAS ALREADY CLEAR-THAT YOUNG PHYSICISTS WERE BECOMING ADDICTED. IT WAS AT THAT TIME-THAT-THE FIRST EMBRYONIC OPERATING SYSTEM APPEARED UNDER THE NAME-OF FORTRAN MONITOR SYSTEM. MANY OTHER-IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCURRED-IN THE EARLY 60'S,-SUCH AS THE CONNECTION OF COMPUTERS ON-LINE TO-FILM MEASURING DEVICES INCLUDING THE VERY FAST AUTOMATIC--- FLYING-SPOT DIGITIZERS---- (HPD, LUCIOLE, ETC..) FORERUNNERS OF THE MODERN-IMAGE DIGITIZERS AND THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT COMPUTERS-DIRECTLY TO EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT (ON-LINE EXPERIMENTS). THE IBM-709 WAS OPERATED ON-LINE TO AN HPD TO MEASURE BOTH BUBBLE AND SPARK-CHAMBER FILMS. IN SEPTEMBER 1963 THE 709 WAS REPLACED BY A---- 7090,---- A TRANSISTORIZED VERSION OF THE SAME MACHINE, ABOUT FOUR-TIMES MORE POWERFUL.-------- IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THE INVESTMENTS AND THE EFFORTS STARTED-TO PAY OFF. OVER------- 300 000 FRAMES OF SPARK CHAMBER FILM WERE-AUTOMATICALLY SCANNED AND MEASURED IN RECORD TIME USING AN HPD-FLYING SPOT DIGITIZER ON-LINE TO THE------ AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME-COMPUTERS WERE CONNECTED ON-LINE TO EXPERIMENTS TO MONITOR THE-EQUIPMENT AND TO COLLECT DIGITAL DATA FROM THE FIRST FILMLESS-DETECTORS (E.G. SONIC SPARK CHAMBERS) ONTO MAGNETIC TAPE. THE FIRST-SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATIONS WITH FULLY AUTO AUTOMATIC DIGITAL PATTERN-RECOGNITION SHOWED THAT COMPUTERS COULD BE PROGRAMMED TO REPLACE-SLOW HUMAN OPERATORS IN A VARIETY OF TASKS. STORIES ABOUT COMPUTERS-DOING THINGS FASTER, BETTER AND MORE RELIABLY THAN HUMAN BEINGS GOT-AROUND PRODUCING THE USUAL MIXTURE RE OF EMOTIONAL REACTIONS. IN-1970 THE EUROPEAN PHYSICS SOCIETY HELD A CONFERENCE-AT CERN ON THE-'IMPACT OF COMPUTERS ON PHYSICS' AND I REMEMBER THE REASSURING-STATEMENT OF AN EMINENT PHYSICIST THAT 'SO FAR COMPUTERS HAVE NOT-SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO ANY DISCOVERY'. IT WAS GOING TO TAKE-ANOTHER DECADE TO SEE THE HEP COMMUNITY WHOLEHEARTEDLY ACCEPTING-THE COMPUTER AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THEIR RESEARCH AND-ADMITTING IT TO THEIR CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL FOUNDATION TRILOGY:---- ACCELERATORS, DETECTORS AND COMPUTERS.------------- 1970 WAS ALSO THE YEAR WHEN THE--- 'CERN COMPUTING AND DATA-HANDLING SCHOOL'---- WAS LAUNCHED TO EDUCATE YOUNG PHYSICISTS AND-STIMULATE THE SHARING OF COMPUTING EXPERIENCE BETWEEN HIGH-ENERGY-PHYSICISTS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE AN-EXCELLENT IDEA. THE SCHOOL IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL, FULFILLING A-CLEAR NEED. AS TO THE CROSS-FERTILIZATION ACROSS THE-PHYSICS/COMPUTER SCIENCE BOUNDARY, IT HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN IDEAL-PARTNERSHIP.-------- ACTUALLY THE TWO DISCIPLINES HAVE INFLUENCED EACH OTHER FROM THE-VERY BEGINNING. IT WAS THE PHYSICIST BRUNO ROSSI WHO BUILT THE-FIRST LOGIC CIRCUITS WHICH THEN WERE DEVELOPED INTO COMPUTER-HARDWARE, AND PHYSICISTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AMONG THE MOST-DEMANDING CONSUMERS OF COMPUTER-CYCLES. ENRICO FERMI, WHEN ASKED IN-THE EARLY FIFTIES WHICH RESEARCH PROJECT WOULD HE RECOMMEND TO THE-YOUNG ITALIAN PHYSICISTS, TOLD THEM TO DESIGN AND BUILD A COMPUTER.-INDEED, PHYSICS RESEARCH COULD NOT HAVE BECOME WHAT IT IS WITHOUT-THE COMPUTER, AND CONVERSELY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPUTER HAS-BEEN DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY THE NEEDS AND VISION OF BASIC-RESEARCH.-------- THE STUDY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTARY MATTER-INVOLVES THE FRONTIERS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AND PUSHES THE TECHNOLOGY-TO THE LIMIT OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE. COMPUTER SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN-PLAYING WITH MODELS AND FORMALISMS, ARCHITECTURES AND LANGUAGES,-INVENTING TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES OF A RATHER THEORETICAL NATURE-AND THEY HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES ACCUSED OF DEVELOPING GENERAL-SOLUTIONS IN SEARCH OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. WHEN A DENSE PROBLEM-SPACE MEETS A RICH SOLUTION SPACE SOME GOOD NEWS CAN BE-EXPECTED... EVIDENCE OF SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS-HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING-EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INFORMATION ERA.--- HIGH-ENERGY-PHYSICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY---- ARE AMONG THOSE DISCIPLINES-WHICH, IN THE SECOND HALF OF OUR CENTURY, HAVE SHOWN THE MOST-IMPRESSIVE ADVANCES.---------------------------------------------------------------  APPENDIX 1 (PART 1)----------------------- ALL THE MAJOR COMPUTERS HAVING SERVED IN THE CERN COMPUTER-CENTRE IN THE PERIOD 1958-1988 ARE LISTED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER,-TOGETHER WITH SOME CONFIGURATION DETAILS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTIC-FEATURES.------------ FERRANTI 'MERCURY'------------- [1958-1965] FIRST GENERATION VACUUM TUBE MACHINE--- (60 MICROSEC---- CLOCK-CYCLE, 2 CYCLES TO LOAD OR STORE,-- CYCLES TO ADD AND 5-CYCLES TO-MULTIPLY 40 BIT LONGWORDS, NO HARDWARE DIVISION) WITH MAGNETIC CORE-STORAGE (1024 40-BIT WORDS,---- MICROSEC ACCESS TIME).

TAPE UNITS-(HALF INCH TAPE, 7 TRACKS, 200, 55--AND--00 BPI, AND ONE INCH-TAPE,--4 TRACKS, 800 BPI). HIGH-SPEED CARD READER (1200 CPM).-------- FIRST MULTI-PROGRAMMED MACHINE IN THE COMPUTER CENTRE. HOWEVER,-SIPROS MULTIPROGRAMMING OPERATING SYSTEM WAS ABANDONED BY CONTROL-DATA. BASIC SIPROS OPERATING SYSTEM HAD TO BE MADE AT CERN. THEN-CHIPPEWA OS (COS) WAS INSTALLED. IT-EVOLVED TO SCOPE WHICH WAS-EVENTUALLY USED AFTER ADAPTING IT TO CERN NEEDS. THIS RESULTED IN A-NON-TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF CHANGES, THUS DESERVING THE RENAMING TO CERN-SCOPE. THE 6600 WAS CONNECTED TO VARIOUS FSD SYSTEMS AND TO-TWO-ON-LINE COMPUTERS, THE SDS920 AND THE IBM 1800, VIA CERN-MADE DATA-LINKS. IN TERMS OF PROCESSING CAPACITY THE 6600 WAS ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A CERN UNIT OR TEN TIMES THE-------------- THE CHANGE-OVER FROM THE IBM 709--WAS PLANNED TO TAKE THREE-MONTHS STARTING IN JANUARY------ MAJOR ENGINEERING OVERHAULS HAD TO-BE DONE INSTEAD DURING THE-FIRST FEW YEARS AND ENDED UP IN A-TWO-MONTHS SHUT-DOWN IN 1968 IN ORDER TO MODIFY THE 6----TO-INCORPORATE LOGIC AND PACKAGING IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN-INTRODUCED IN THE PRODUCTION MACHINES. DURING THIS LONG PERIOD OF-STRUGGLING WITH HARDWARE INSTABILITIES AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND-CHANGES, COMPUTING WORK WAS DONE PARTLY BY SENDING-JOBS TO OUTSIDE-COMPUTERS AND PARTLY BY PROCESSING DATA ON A CDC 3400, AND LATER ON-A 3800, TEMPORARILY MADE AVAILABLE AT CERN BY CONTROL DATA.------------ CDC------------- 3800 [1966-1968] THE 3800 WAS A MEMBER OF THE 3000 SERIES CDC FAMILY OF-COMPUTERS, INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE 6000 SERIES MACHINES. MORE-CONVENTIONAL THAN THE-6600, THE 3800 HAD A----BIT ARCHITECTURE. THE-CORE MEMORY (64 KWORDS) WAS REPLACED BY A FASTER ONE (800 NSEC)-DURING ITS STAYING AT CERN. THIS MACHINE WAS EVENTUALLY ACQUIRED BY-THE STATE OF GENEVA AND INSTALLED AT THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY. AT CERN-IT WAS REPLACED BY A CDC------ IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT CERN-ACQUIRED OTHER MACHINES OF THE 3000 S SERIES, E.G. A 3100 FOR THE-FOCUS PROJECT OFFERING SEMI-INTERACTIVE FACILITIES AND QUICK-SAMPLING OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA AT THE-CENTRAL COMPUTERS, AND A- 3200FOR INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS APPLICATIONS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  FOR MATTERS RELATED TO THIS ARTICLE PLEASE CONTACT-THE AUTHOR.-------------------------------------------------------------- CNL.EDITOR@CERN.CH----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
