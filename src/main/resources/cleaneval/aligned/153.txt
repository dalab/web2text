- Miguel Marquina (editor)-
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□1. INTRODUCTION□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000□years ago
when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,□or 300 years
ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented the□first arithmetic
machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 years□ago when one of the
first electronic digital computers, a huge□Ferranti Mercury, was
installed. It was the beginning of a success□story which has changed
the way to do physics and, as a matter of□fact, to do any work at all
in the Laboratory.□□□□□□□□□The story goes on and the changes brought in by the new□information
technologies continue to affect us at an astonishing□rate. Those who
witnessed the beginning of the information era were□conscious of the
potential impact of those mar marvellous machines□on Physics as well as
on Society, but they could hardly imagine□what was to come. In
retrospect, we can say that the 30 years which□separate us from the
days of those first generation machines, have□been years of struggle,
of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and of□painful reappraisal, but also
years of discovery, of excitement, of□achievement and of pride to the
actors in this unique□adventure.□□□□□□□□□Of those 30 CERN years, I missed only the first three. I did not□miss,
however, the joys of programming first generation machines,□although in
a different environment. Actually, when I joined CERN□early in 1962,
the only machines around were still made out of□vacuum tubes. I am,
therefore, rather well placed to tell my□personal account of the □□□what,
why and how□□□□ of the evolution□of automatic computing at CERN.□□□□□□□□□I shall not even attempt to be exhaustive, let alone objective.□I shall
tell the story as I saw it, or rather as I lived it.□Instead of
compressing 262800 hours into 1, I shall select and□report only those
events which, in my opinion, are either real□milestones or make an
interesting story, and I shall follow them□through to their
consequences, even if this means breaking the□strict chronological
order. The basic features of the large□high-performance systems which
have played a major role in the CERN□Computer Center are listed in
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Appendix□1□□□□.□□□□□□□□□□□□□2. THE BIG BANG□□□□□□□□□□□□□□It took six days for God to build the Universe and a little over□two
years for the Ferranti engineers to produce our □□□Mercury□□□□,□a large
assembly of complex circuitry hidden inside a row of□austere cabinets,
making few concessions ons to people's curiosity.□At about the same
time the PS was built in five years and today one□can build
accelerators 1000 times more powerful, always in about□five years. The
Mercury was 1000 times less powerful (16.6 kHz)□than a modern personal
computer which is now mass-produced by□robotized assembly lines at the
rate of 2 or 3 per minute!□□□□□□□□□The purchasing contract was signed on the 25th of May, 1956
and□stipulated that □□□the machine with 1024 40-bit words of□□□□□□□□□fast□□□□ [ 120
microsec to read/write one word from the□accumulator] □□□core store□□□□□□□□and a □□□slow□□□□□□□□ [8.75 msec□latency] □□□drum store□□□□□□□□having a total capacity of
16384□words of 40 binary digits,□□□□ would be shipped to CERN □□□in early□February 1957 and installation shall be completed by 1st
May,□1957.... The details of the progress of manufacture will
be□submitted at intervals of one month.□□□□ The Mercury had a clock□cycle of
60 microsec. It took 180 microsec to add and 300 microsec□to multiply
two long words of 40 bits. It had floating point□arithmetic. Division,
however, had to be programmed. It is□interesting to note the absence of
the word □□□software□□□□ from□the contract, the only relevant mention being:
□□□any programs and□sub-routines which Ferranti will prepare will be made
available to□CERN free of charge.□□□□ Unbundling and licensing were
unknown□in the 50's.□□□□□□□□□The computer actually arrived during the summer of □□□1958□□□□□and passed the
acceptance tests in October of that year. Following□its successful
introduction, a thick file of orders revealed the□urgent need for spare
valves and of □□□tape bins□□□□ (a critical□device in those days of punched
paper tape input/output!).□□□□□□□□□At the end of 1958, the availability of a programming language□called □□□□□□□□□Autocode□□□□□□□□□□□, attracted the first users to□the computer centre and marked
the beginning of the 30 years of□computing covered by this paper. It is
interesting to note that the□first □□□□□□Mercury Autocode□□□□□□□ compiler was
written in 1956□(by R. A. Brooker), two years before the appearance of
the first□□□□FORTRAN□□□□ compiler! It had many features which appeared later□in
FORTRAN. Due to memory limitations, variable names were□restricted to a
single alphabetic character (5-bit Ferranti code).□It is worth noting
that in the mid 50's the European computer□industry was still
competitive. As far as competence, innovative□ideas and successful
products are concerned, European companies□like □□□□□□Ferranti, English
Electric□□□□□□□ and □□□□□□□Elliott□□□□□□□ in England, □□□□□□Telefunken□□□□□□□ in Germany and□□□□□□□Bull□□□□□□□ in
France had little to envy their American□competitors (e.g.
□□□□□□ERA/Remington Rand, NCR, IBM□□□□□□□). The□size and the drive of the American
market were, however, going to□make the difference quite rapidly in the
60's.□□□□□□□□□The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury were□technical,
political and financial. Technically the Mercury was□definitely one of
the most advanced machines around. It was□considered superior to the
Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, to□the English Electric 'Deuce',
to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and to□drum-type machines like the IBM 650.
Ferranti was set up to produce□a dozen units and CERN was going to get
serial number 6. The fact□that Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's
was given a certain□weight. CERN had no experience in electronic
digital computers and□it was better to be part of a club of users. As
to the price (one□million Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than
equivalent□American machines like the ERA 1101.□□□□□□□□□Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and
1956.□External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad
Zuse's□relay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general
purpose□computer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years
after□Maurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues
of□binary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating
point□arithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the
EDSAC□32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10
digits□words. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n
for□the ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input
and□output data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or
cards).□Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of
the□hardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment
of□experts. Obsolescence was already a problem.□□□□□□□□□CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that□32-bit
words were too short, and that the speed should be as high□as possible
(in particular multiplication time should be under a□millisecond). It
also concluded that the speed and size of□memory were very important
□□□(several tens of thousands of binary□digits□□□□ were a clear necessity),
while the availability of□floating point hardware was considered a □□□very
desirable,□although not quite indispensable, feature of a
scientific□computer.□□□□ But what really □□□makes it worthwhile to have
a□machine, is the enthusiasm for carrying out the most
difficult□computations,□□□□ as an American physicist put it in a
letter□describing his experience with a digital computer or □□□'the□courage
to go ahead and solve problems which would have seemed too□difficult to
do otherwise.'□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The computers of that time had colorful names like ILLIAC at
the□University of Illinois, AVIDAC at Argonne, MANIAC, UNIVAC,
etc...□Most of them were prototypes. Everything was very
much□experimental. The operations arrangements at the ILLIAC
were□described as follows: □□□'The user deposits his punched paper tape□in
a box with instructions or the operator. The operator takes□these
tapes, and inserts them in the machine in turn. If the code□is correct,
the machine delivers the answers and these may be□picked up by the user
the next morning. If there are errors in the□code, the operator carries
out the test routines requested and the□results of these tests are
deposited so that these may be reviewed□by the user the next morning.
Thus, the whole operation of the□machine becomes a fairly automatic
affair'.□□□□ This was more or□less the style adopted for our operations
thirty years ago.□□□□□□□□□One of the first applications at CERN was the analysis of the□papertape
produced by the Instruments for the Evaluation of□Photographs (IEPs),
used to scan and measure bubble chamber film.□The first reports convey
a certain deception due to the slow tape□read/write speed. Since
everything had to go through the□accumulator, the CPU was blocked
during I/0. It was immediately□clear that there was a big mismatch
between the power of the□computing engine and its input/output
capability.□□□□□□□□□After some struggling with faulty tubes, tape bins,
machine□instructions and □□□□□□Autocode□□□□□□□, people with lots of data□discovered
the existence of an IBM 704 in Paris, which offered□significant
advantages such as □□□magnetic tape units, card□readers, line printers and
FORTRAN!□□□□ FORTRAN II allowed□6-characters variable names and, most
important, it simplified the□exchange of programs with Berkeley and
Brookhaven. The 1959 CERN□Annual Report indicated □□□already□□□□ that □□□as the needs□increase, it will be necessary to envisage the replacement of
the□Mercury by a more powerful system.□□□□ It was also quickly realized□that
these so-called electronic brains required quite a lot of□human effort
to be effectively exploited. Hence the proposal to□double in 1960 the
computer center staff (from 10 to 20).□□□□□□□□□So, by the end of the 50's, the fundamental forces, sociological□and
technological, characteristic of every computer service, had□been
discovered, including the illusion that upgrading the□resources would
solve all the problems and achieve the ultimate□goal, i.e. □□□make the
users happy!□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□3. THE LESSONS OF THE EARLY 60'S□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The next big news was the arrival of the □□□IBM 709,□□□□ an□improved version
of the 704, in January 1961. It was still a clumsy□vacuum tube machine
but it featured FORTRAN and all those fancy□peripherals apt to improve
the □□□quality of life□□□□.□□□□□□□□□The word length was 36 bits, the characters became 6-bit BCD,□and the
core memory size jumped to 32K. The CPU was 4-5 times□faster than that
of the Mercury. However, to compile a □□□typical□FORTRAN program could
take several minutes!□□□□ Tape bins made way□for card trays. Magnetic tape
units read and wrote at 75 ips on 7□tracks and the density was 200 bpi.
Peripherals were attached via□their controllers to data channels. It
was a significant advance in□that it allowed as many as six peripheral
devices to access core□memory buffers while the CPU performed other
work. Another□important device which came with the 709 was the
so-called Direct□Data Connection, allowing for direct transmission of
data from□external equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was
not□ridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was
also□equipped with one of the first □□□interrupt systems.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The bad news was still the poor reliability, although the□progress was
already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenance□represented 11% of
the total time. Scheduled maintenance took away□a time slice of similar
size. So the down-time of the 709 compared□not too unfavorably with the
up time of the very first electronic□computers.... The on-line card
reader and the printer did, however,□slow down the operations
considerably. After one year of experience□CERN added a small IBM 1401,
in order to speed up the input/output,□the job sequencing and the
operations. The concept of SPOOLing□(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation
On-Line) with its 1/0 files□(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in
those days. Programming□for the 709 was considered a difficult activity
to be left to the□specialists who could understand and keep up-to-date
with the new□techniques and the operating conventions. The machine was
□□□an□expensive resource□□□□ which had to be used efficiently. To give an□idea,
the list price was in the region of ten millions francs□(1960 Swiss
francs!). In those days a □□□magnetic tape cost 60 $□(some 260□□□□ SF!). It
was at that time that the first inescapable□committees □□□appeared, e.g.□□□□
Computer Scheduling Committee,□Computer Users Advisory Committee and
the Data Handling Policy□Group.□□□□□□□□□The Mercury had still its faithful users but suffered from the□chronic
lack of modern, fast peripherals. In 1962, as part of a□lifting
operation, it was enhanced by the connection of an Ampex□tape unit,
□□□compatible with IBM specifications□□□□ and operating□at 3333 characters per
second (over 3 times the speed of the□fastest paper tape reader and
some 20 times faster than a tape□punch). Also, two papertape-to-card
converters were installed □□□to□ease the transfer of data from the Mercury
to the□□□□ 709. By the□end of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape
from IEPs into□the Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the
results□on magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for
further□analysis. The first application packages appeared at that
time,□e.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction
and□kinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to
note□that, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic
development□of codes, the machines were normally switched off at
weekends. But□the practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was
around the□corner. It is also in interesting to realize that things
like the□connection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were
entirely□designed and implemented on site.□□□□□□□□□The next problem was how to use all those □□□□□□Autocode□□□□□□□□programs on the 709.
One just wrote an □□□□□□Autocode□□□□□□□□compiler for the 709. The difficulties of
developing software were□soon to be learned. The first Conference
recognizing the existence□of a software crisis was held in Munich in
1968. Why is software□always late and unreliable? People working today
with modern CASE□(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) or OOP
(Object Oriented□Programming) tools are still trying to solve the
problem. But the□answer in those days was: □□□better programming
languages□□□□.□□□□□□□□□CERN FORTRAN was defined to ensure compatibility with
other□laboratories and facilitate portability of codes. It was
felt,□however, that FORTRAN was used □□□mainly for historical reasons□□□□□and
new, more powerful languages would be needed to fully exploit□the
potential of the electronic computer. As we all know, CERN was□not
affected by, or it missed completely, the language explosion□which
started in the early 60's. ALGOL, Lisp, PL/I, PASCAL, Modula□II, ADA,
C, PROLOG, etc... did not raise above the level of□minority cultures.
FORTRAN evolved through its versions II, IV, 66,□77, 8X, and it still
dominates the CERN programming landscape.□□□□□□□□□It took some time to saturate the 709, but it was already clear□that
young physicists were becoming addicted. It was at that time□that the
first embryonic Operating System appeared under the name□of FORTRAN
Monitor System. Many other important events occurred□in the early 60's,
such as the connection of computers on-line to□film measuring devices
including the very fast automatic □□□flying□spot digitizers□□□□ (HPD, Luciole,
etc..) forerunners of the modern□image digitizers and the first
attempts to connect computers□directly to experimental equipment
(on-line experiments). The IBM□709 was operated on-line to an HPD to
measure both bubble and spark□chamber films. In September 1963 the 709
was replaced by a □□□□7090,□□□□ a transistorized version of the same machine,
about four□times more powerful.□□□□□□□□□It was at that time that the investments and the efforts started□to pay
off. Over □□□300 000□□□□ frames of spark chamber film were□automatically
scanned and measured in record time using an HPD□Flying Spot Digitizer
on-line to the 7090. At about the same time□computers were connected
on-line to experiments to monitor the□equipment and to collect digital
data from the first filmless□detectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto
magnetic tape. The first□successful demonstrations with fully auto
automatic digital pattern□recognition showed that computers could be
programmed to replace□slow human operators in a variety of tasks.
Stories about computers□doing things faster, better and more reliably
than human beings got□around producing the usual mixture re of
emotional reactions. In□1970 the European Physics Society held a
Conference at CERN on the□'Impact of Computers on Physics' and I
remember the reassuring□statement of an eminent physicist that 'so far
computers have not□significantly contributed to any discovery'. It was
going to take□another decade to see the HEP community wholeheartedly
accepting□the computer as a critical component of their research
and□admitting it to their current technological foundation trilogy:
□□□
accelerators, detectors and computers.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□1970 was also the year when the □□□'CERN Computing and Data□Handling School'□□□□ was launched to educate young physicists and□stimulate the
sharing of computing experience between high-energy□physicists and
computer scientists. It turned out to be an□excellent idea. The School
is still alive and well, fulfilling a□clear need. As to the
cross-fertilization across the□physics/computer science boundary, it
has developed into an ideal□partnership.□□□□□□□□□Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from the□very
beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built the□first logic
circuits which then were developed into computer□hardware, and
physicists have always been among the most□demanding consumers of
computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked in□the early fifties which
research project would he recommend to the□young Italian physicists,
told them to design and build a computer.□Indeed, physics research
could not have become what it is without□the computer, and conversely,
the development of the computer has□been deeply influenced by the needs
and vision of basic□research.□□□□□□□□□The study of the fundamental properties of elementary matter□involves
the frontiers of human knowledge and pushes the technology□to the limit
of what is possible. Computer scientists have been□playing with models
and formalisms, architectures and languages,□inventing tools and
methodologies of a rather theoretical nature□and they have been
sometimes accused of developing general□solutions in search of specific
problems. When a dense problem□space meets a rich solution space some
good news can be□expected... Evidence of synergistic effects has been
accumulating□ever since the beginning of the information era.
□□□High-energy□physics and information technology□□□□ are among those
disciplines□which, in the second half of our century, have shown the
most□impressive advances.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Appendix 1 (part 1)□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□All the major computers having served in the CERN Computer□Centre in
the period 1958-1988 are listed in chronological order,□together with
some configuration details and their characteristic□features.□□□□□□□□□□□□□FERRANTI 'Mercury' [1958-1965]□□□□□□□□□□□□□□First generation vacuum tube machine □□□(60 microsec□□□□ clock□cycle, 2 cycles
to load or store, 3 cycles to add and 5 cycles to□multiply 40 bit
longwords, no hardware division) with magnetic core□storage (1024
40-bit words, 120 microsec access time). Mercury's□processor had
floating point arithmetic and a B-Register (index□register). Magnetic
drum auxiliary storage (16 Kwords of 40 bits,□8.75 msec average
latency, 64 longwords transferred per□revolution). Paper tape I/0. Two
Ampex magtape units added in 1962.□□□□□□□Autocode□□□□□□□ compiler. At the end of its
career it was□connected on-line to an experiment (Missing Mass
Spectrometer). In□1966 the Mercury was shipped to Poland as a gift to
the Academy of□Mining and Metallurgy at Cracow.□□□□□□□□□□□□□IBM 709 [1961-1963]□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Vacuum tube machine (□□□12 microsec□□□□ clock cycle, 2 cycles to□add and 15 on
average to multiply 36 bit integers, hardwired□division and floating
point arithmetic, index registers) with core□storage (32 Kwords of 36
bits, 24 microsec access time). Card□reader (250 cpm) and card punch
(100 cpm). Line printer. Magtape□units (7 tracks, 75 ips, 200 bpi).
Introduction of the Data□Channel. FORTRAN compiler. FORTRAN Monitor
System.□□□□□□□□□□□□□IBM 7090 [1963-1965]□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Transistorized second-generation machine ( □□□2.18 microsec□□□□□clock cycle)
with core storage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 4.36 microsec□access time).
Card 1/0, Tape units (7 tracks, 112.5 ips, 200/556□bpi). Eight Data
Channels. Interrupt System. FORTRAN compiler.□Basic Monitor Operating
System (IBSYS). Connected on-line to Flying□Spot Digitizers (HPD and
Luciole) to measure bubble and spark□chamber films.□□□□□□□□□□□□□CDC 6600 [1965-1975]□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Serial Number 3 (pre-production series machine). Transistor□machine
designed by Seymour Cray and very compact for its time. CPU□clock cycle □□□100 nsec□□□□. Core memory: 128 Kwords of 60 bits.□Memory access 1 microsec,
but independent memory banks allowed for□up to one access per clock
cycle. Instruction prefetch. Ten□overlapping functional units. Ten
autonomous peripheral processor□units (PPU's) each with 4K of 12-bit
words core memory. Huge disks□over one meter in diameter holding 500
million bits. Tape Units□(half inch tape, 7 tracks, 200, 556 and 800
bpi, and one inch tape,□14 tracks, 800 bpi). High-speed card reader
(1200 cpm).□□□□□□□□□First multi-programmed machine in the Computer Centre. However,□SIPROS
multiprogramming operating system was abandoned by Control□Data. Basic
SIPROS operating system had to be made at CERN. Then□Chippewa OS (COS)
was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which was□eventually used after
adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in a□non-trivial amount of
changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERN□SCOPE. The 6600 was
connected to various FSD systems and to two□on-line computers, the
SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made data□links. In terms of
processing capacity the 6600 was about three□quarters of a CERN unit or
ten times the 7090.□□□□□□□□□The change-over from the IBM 7090 was planned to take three□months
starting in January 1965. Major engineering overhauls had to□be done
instead during the first few years and ended up in a□two-months
shut-down in 1968 in order to modify the 6600 to□incorporate logic and
packaging improvements which had been□introduced in the production
machines. During this long period of□struggling with hardware
instabilities and software development and□changes, computing work was
done partly by sending jobs to outside□computers and partly by
processing data on a CDC 3400, and later on□a 3800, temporarily made
available at CERN by Control Data.□□□□□□□□□□□□□CDC 3800 [1966-1968]□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The 3800 was a member of the 3000 series CDC family of□computers,
incompatible with the 6000 series machines. More□conventional than the
6600, the 3800 had a 48-bit architecture. The□core memory (64 Kwords)
was replaced by a faster one (800 nsec)□during its staying at CERN.
This machine was eventually acquired by□the State of Geneva and
installed at the local University. At CERN□it was replaced by a CDC
6400. It is worth noting that CERN□acquired other machines of the 3000
s series, e.g. a 3100 for the□FOCUS project offering semi-interactive
facilities and quick□sampling of experimental data at the central
computers, and a 3200□for interactive graphics applications.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
