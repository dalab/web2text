"A LIFE" IS PART OF A SERIES-OF ANIMATED COMMERCIALS FOR UNITED AIRLINES PRODUCED BY ACME FILMWORKS FOR THE AGENCY FALLON/WORLDWIDE OF MINNEAPOLIS; INCLUDING "LIGHT BULB" BY JOANNA QUINN AND "INTERVIEW" BY WENDY TILBY AND AMANDA FORBIS.-------- "THE MEN FROM KING CAMERA WERE EXPERIENCED, PROFESSIONAL, PERFECTIONISTS AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE ANIMATOR'S MIND. I-WANTED TO RELY ON THEIR SKILLS TOTALLY AND I COULD. WONDERFUL. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE GOT ON REALLY WELL." STATED MICHAEL DUDOK DE WIT, DIRECTOR.-------- WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF RECAPTURING THE OSCAR, BAFTA,-GRAND PRIX---PRIX DU PUBLIC AWARD-WINNING STYLE OF "FATHER AND DAUGHTER", MICHAEL-DUDOK DE WIT DECIDED TO APPROACH KING CAMERA.-SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR, CHRIS KING, AND CREATIVE SENIOR DIGITAL ARTIST & COMPOSITOR, TIM BARTER BROUGHT THE PRODUCTION TOGETHER. MICHAEL INITIALLY CREATED COLOUR MODELS IN PHOTOSHOP WHILE KING CAMERA CREATED SPECIAL PURPOSE BUILT MODULES TO EMULATE THE VARIOUS PHOTOSHOP BLENDING MODES USED IN THE MODELS. AS WITH MICHAEL'S PREVIOUS WORK, TEXTURES WERE REQUIRED, NOT ONLY FOR THE BACKGROUNDS BUT ALSO FOR ALL THE CHARACTERS, WITH SOME SCENES REQUIRING THE APPLICATION OF OVER 70 TEXTURES AT A TIME. USANIMATION'S(R) NEW OPUS UPGRADE, COUPLED WITH MICHAEL'S INIMITABLE LINE QUALITY WITH IT'S SUBTLE GREYSCALE-VARIATIONS, ACHIEVED THE DESIRED EFFECTS.-------- KING CAMERA'S FULL HD CAPABILITY, TEAMED WITH-TOON BOOM'S-USANIMATIONS'(R) OPUS-RESOLUTION-INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE, ENABLED THE OUTPUT OF TWO VERSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY; IN HIGH DEFINITION (HD) AT 2--FRAMES PER SECOND AND NTSC FORMATS AT 30 FRAMES PER SECOND. TIM BARTER CONFIRMS: "IN ALL WE HAD AN EXTENSIVE USE OF OVER 1200 TEXTURES ACROSS THE 60 SECOND COMMERCIAL. SO WITH THE ADDITIONAL NEED TO PERFECTLY RETAIN MICHAEL'S-OUTSTANDING-LINE QUALITY AND OUTPUT TO BOTH HI-DEF AND NTSC WITHIN AN EXTREMELY TIGHT DEADLINE, USANIMATION(R) ONCE AGAIN PROVED-ITSELF TO BE AN IDEAL TOOL.-- ADDITIONALLY, KING CAMERA'S CHRIS KING MADE USE OF HOUDINI FROM SIDE EFFECTS TO CREATE SNOWFALL FOR THE COMMERCIAL AND COMPOSITE NTSC FIELD RENDERED OUTPUT FROM USANIMATION'S(R) OPUS.-------- THE PRODUCTION WAS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND WORK INTENSIVE, CHALLENGED BY A DEADLINE THAT WAS MOVED FORWARD BY TWO WEEKS AND RESULTED IN MICHAEL CREATING ARTWORK THROUGH TO THE VERY LAST DAYS OF PRODUCTION. WITH THIS IN MIND, KING CAMERA'S SENIOR DIGITAL ARTIST AND COMPOSITOR, TIM BARTER, DECIDED TO STRUCTURE THE COMPOSITING OF THE PRODUCTION SO THAT MOST OF THE IMPORTANT TEXTURES AND COLOUR MODELS COULD-ARRIVE LATER WITHOUT IMPACTING ON THE DEADLINE.- TO THIS EFFECT, HIGHLY COMPLEX COMPOSITING MODULES WERE-CREATED THAT ENABLED ANY CHARACTERS OR TEXTURES TO BE PLUGGED INTO THEM. MICHAEL'S STORYBOARD WAS THEN EXTRAPOLATED TO CREATE PROXY CHARACTERS THAT WOULD LATER BE SCANNED IN AS THE REAL THING. IN THE PROCESS, APPROXIMATELY 1200 PROXY TEXTURES WERE CREATED AND PLUGGED IN, TO BE REPLACED AS AND WHEN THE CORRECT TEXTURES ARRIVED.- THIS MEANT THAT THE ENTIRE JOB COULD BE 'COMPOSITED' LONG BEFORE THE ACTUAL ARTWORK-ARRIVED, WITH ONLY MINOR CHANGES TO FOLLOW.-------- "THE KING CAMERA-WORK ETHIC IS THAT WITH PROPER ORGANISATION, COMMUNICATION AND PRE-VISUALISATION, NO PRODUCTION SHOULD BE STRESSFUL OR OVER-RUN BEYOND THE NORMAL HOURS IN THE DAY-! WISHFUL THINKING PERHAPS, BUT FOR THE ABOVE REASONS, WORKING WITH MICHAEL WAS AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. DESPITE MICHAEL'S OVERWHELMING WORKLOAD, HE WAS INCREDIBLY ORGANISED, WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO-WORK FROM HIS STORYBOARDS, ENSURING THAT NEITHER OF-US BECAME DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER FOR MATERIAL. MICHAEL ALSO HAD SUCH-PRE CONCEIVED IDEAS OF WHAT HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE, THAT I WAS ABLE TO CONFIDENTLY WORK IN UNISON WITH HIM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR WORK WOULDN'T ALL-BECOME REDUNDANT AS CHANGES WERE MADE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. CONSEQUENTLY, DESPITE A CURTAILED DELIVERY PERIOD, A MASSIVE WORKLOAD FOR-MICHAEL AND THE NEED TO WORK TOWARDS BOTH-HIGH DEFINITION AND NTSC-OUTPUTS, THE PRODUCTION WAS WONDERFULLY STRESS FREE."
